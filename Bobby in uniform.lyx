\begin_layout Standard
Ever since I was about five years old, about the time when most kids show
 each other their God-given implement of peeing, their gender awareness
 a new and exciting thing to share with the world at large, I saw things.
 Strange, mysterious, butt-ugly and downright scary things that mostly lacked
 a body in any sense of the word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I once told my teacher, Mrs.
 Resenbaum that some scary looking ghost of a one-eyed person was ogling
 her in a very sexual though quite incorporeal way.
 Of course, I was only twelve at the time so I just said,

\begin_layout Standard
As the natural course of events ran through, I got spanked and she got raped
 by the ghost of a miner.
 Or that's what the papers in Perry County Ohio reported that she insisted
 at the good doctors at the Ridges even while they fastened her straightjacket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call them what you will, ghosts, spirits, demons; any name is just as good
 cause it sometimes just doesn't do these creatures justice.
 Whatever you want to call them, I had the dubious privilege of having some
 sort of affinity with the otherworld, the afterlife, the world of the spirits
 and so on.

Around where I grew up, Rendville, Ohio, I was just a boy with a wild imaginatio
n that needed some good ol' spanking with a wet plank, which is what I mostly
 got every once so often I couldn't keep my mouth shut 'cause

\begin_layout Standard
My father was a miner, my uncle too; grandpa as well.
 Practically everyone in Rendville was a miner; at an early age I realised
 it was just as natural as the ghosts and the other weird stuff.
 I became one even before I finished school, because the times were hard,
 bread, lard and meat didn't come free and something about Roosevelt being
 such 'a god-damn two-nickel sunava-', which is as far as I ever heard my
 father swear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Me on the other hand, once I got into the mining business, I got the hang
 of it really fast.
 It wasn't just my, hard-working, God-fearing, swamp-mouthed colleagues
 in the coal extraction business; it was the sheer number of dead things
 that talk the deeper you delve into the bosom of the earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just as well though because I had seen the shittiest, weirdest, most
 awful, God-forlorn things from the other side that I just felt like I couldn't
 be surprised.
 It came handy, really.
 When one of them tried to possess a man, I gave them the stare; when they
 plotted about haunting the mines so they could turn them into a mini-golf
 club, I read them their rites, God bless my mother's soul, and that made
 them shrill and shriek and go back to playing poker with the dwarves.
\end_layout

Yup, it was thanks to her that I could turn most evil spirits away with
 a prayer.
 She took me to church, insisted that I become an altar boy, and each every
 time I swore made sure I had my share of pepper and read the Good Book
 aloud.
 And the Prayers.
 And the writings of Thomas Aquinas.
 And the latest Opus Dei journal.
 And every kind of book labeled Religion at the school library.
 She used to say that

.
 I still can't believe how literally right she was without ever knowing
 it.
 I also miss her raspberry pie.

\begin_layout Standard
That reading thing kind of grew on me and on Sundays, right after church,
 I took my bike to New Lexington and got on the bus to Cambridge.
 Once I had realised it wasn't the prestigious site of knowledge and lore
 famous around the world, I settled for the homely library of St.
 Benedict's, whose staff at the time, a centenarian by the name of Mr.
 Galsworthy, was kind enough to leave at my disposal since it was mostly
 empty and he was mostly asleep.
