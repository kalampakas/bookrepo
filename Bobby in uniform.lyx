Chapter 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ever since I was about five years old, about the time when most kids develop
 the tendency to show each other their God-given implement of peeing, their
 gender awareness a new and exciting thing to share with the world at large,
 I saw things.
 Strange, mysterious, butt-ugly and downright scary things that mostly lacked
 a body in any sense of the word.
 My mother insisted that there weren't such things as ghosts, except perhaps
 in fairy tales and pulp stories.
 Still, the apparitions wouldn't go away, and when shooed would blankly
 stare back in bewilderment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I once told my second grade teacher \SpecialChar \-
 Mrs.
 Resenbaum, God bless her Jewish soul \SpecialChar \-
 that some scary looking ghost of
 a one-eyed person who might've been a pirate when alive was ogling her
 in a distinctively inappropriate yet quite incorporeal way.
 Of course, I was only eight or so at the time so I just blurted, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lookit! There's an old dead man with a beard full o' lice wants to grab
 your titties, Mrs.
 Resenbaum! He means bad, I tell ya!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the natural course of events ran through, I got spanked and she got raped
 by the ghost of a black (what they called a negro back then) miner.
 Or that's what the papers in Perry County Ohio reported that she insisted
 telling the good doctors at the Ridges asylum even while they fastened
 her straightjacket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call them what you will: ghosts, spirits, demons.
 Any name is just as good because it sometimes just doesn't do these creatures
 justice.
 Whatever you want to call them, I realised I had the dubious privilege
 of having some sort of affinity with the otherworld, the afterlife, the
 world of the spirits, if you will.
 Some would call it a gift, others would call it a curse.
 I certainly had no name for it.
 It was as natural to me as sight and the fact that old people smelled weird.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Around where I grew up though, Rendville, Ohio, seeing dead things meant
 that I was just a boy with a wild imagination that needed some good ol'
 spanking with a wet plank, even if I were my parents' only child.
 That's what I mostly got every once so often when I couldn't keep my mouth
 shut 'cause 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just saw a mammoth's ghost burn down a zombie dinosaur with a blue slimy
 kind of fire, pops!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Saying things like that outside the family circles would evoke dismissive
 frowns and sometimes the sympathetic looks of neighbours and townfolk,
 and all in all it never failed to teach me the merits of silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My father was a miner, my uncle too; grandpa as well.
 Almost everyone in Rendville was a miner, except for the whores and the
 bartenders.
 And Mr.
 Calliburton, the grocer, who also owned the hardware store, the blacksmith's
 as well as the drug store and the butcher's: Mr.
 Calliburton called himself an entrepreneur, the good people of Rendville
 called him a bloodsucking demon \SpecialChar \-
 to which I can attest, he verily wasn't
 so, at least in a literal fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a mining town, the thought of being a miner when I grew up felt just
 as natural as the ghosts and all the weird stuff that I alone could see
 and talk to.
 There wasn't actually anything natural about talking to dead people or
 incorporeal creatures as most of them had pointed out on occasion, but
 still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I began working in the mines before I had even finished high school, because
 as my father used to say, the times were hard and bread, lard and meat
 didn't just fall off the sky.
 It apparently had something to do about Roosevelt being such `a god-damn
 two-nickel sunava-', which was as far as I had ever heard my father swear.
 God bless his soul, he did insist that I finished school, even if it meant
 working the evening shifts.
 Needless to say, in my spare time I did a lot of snoring and zero socializing.
 Which didn't matter much in a class of six students, half of them ridden
 with polio.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once I got into the mining business, I got the hang of it really fast.
 All you had to do was keep digging and chipping stone and blowing up new
 tunnels all day long, six days a week, twelve hours a day.
 There was a lot of thin coal dust and sweat involved and most of the days
 I missed the sun, but it felt remarkably exciting for all the wrong reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't just my hard-working, God-fearing, swamp-mouthed colleagues in
 the coal extraction business that helped me ease into the job.
 It was the sheer number of dead things that would talk to me and try to
 claw and possess their way past me, the number of heads and assorted tails
 and life-threatening incorporeal body parts growing the deeper one delved
 into the bosom of the earth, that one being myself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just as well though because I felt I had seen the shittiest, weirdest,
 most awful, God-forlorn things from the other side that I'd just become
 jaded.
 I became genuinely impervious to surprises, of any sort.
 I became imparted with a coolness that verged on stiff cold.
 It came handy, really.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When one of them creatures (a self-identified poltergeist) tried to possess
 a man, I gave it the stare and it just felt so bad about it the next day
 it got me candy (well, maggots, but that's kind of like candy for undead
 things and their ilk).
 When a group of banshees plotted about haunting the mines so they could
 turn them into a mini-golf club, I read them their rites, God bless my
 mother's soul, and that made them shrill and shriek and go back to playing
 poker with the undead dwarves really deep down in the crust (who, I might
 add, are a lot paler and a lot less hairy than when alive).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yup.
 It was thanks to my mother that I could turn most evil spirits away with
 a prayer.
 Or a nod, a flick of the wrist and sometimes just breathing their way especiall
y after having some of grandpa's beef jerky.
 It was my mother that took me to church on Sundays, insisted that I become
 an altar boy, and each and every time swear words came out of my mouth,
 it was her that made sure I had my share of pepper and read the Good Book
 aloud.
 And the Prayers.
 And the writings of Thomas Aquinas.
 And the latest Opus Dei journal.
 And generally every kind of book labeled Religion at the school library.
 She was adamant she'd raise a good boy even if it meant martyrdom.
 She used to say that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

only God can save your soul, Robert Clovis Barhoe, you wicked devil's child!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I still can't believe how literally right she was without ever knowing
 it.
 I also miss her raspberry pie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole reading books thing kind of grew on me little by little though;
 there were fascinating tales in every book about God.
 Floods, burning bushes, dead people coming to life; I could relate to that
 easily.
 On Sundays, right after church, I would take my bike to New Lexington and
 get on the bus to Cambridge, which sadly wasn't a city with a lot of action,
 paranormally speaking.
 As a lonely poltergeist put it, `Cambridge? Deader than a dodo, deader
 than me'.
 Once I realised it wasn't the prestigious site of knowledge and lore famous
 around the world that I had hoped for, I settled for the homely library
 of St.
 Benedict's School whose sole staff member at the time, a centenarian by
 the name of Mr.
 Galsworthy, was kind enough to leave at my disposal since the library was
 mostly empty on Sundays.
 The old man, God bless his soul, snored heavily.
 He died peacefully on the job too, having fallen asleep, much like every
 other day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Life went on mostly uneventfully for some time.
 I worked in the mines and kept them from being haunted with very little
 effort.
 Sometimes I helped the occasional exorcist or vampire hunter that seemed
 to be at a loss around our parts (you won't believe how amateurish these
 kind of people are; they think vampires \SpecialChar \-
 vampires, of all paranormal creatures!
 \SpecialChar \-
 are nocturnal).
 In between, I discovered old and exotic tomes at the library.
 Some contained surprisingly lewd pictures and others bored me to death
 with their Latin.
 I also picked up a couple of languages on the way: not only Latin, which
 seemed essential at first, but stuff that would nonetheless prove useful,
 like Tauric and Cimmeric.
 I generally had a blast back in those days, eating Sundaes on Sundays and
 exchanging thoughts and opinions on the medicinal and religious usage of
 hallucinogens from first-hand accounts of long-deceased native indians,
 i.e.
 their ghosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that changed dramatically when we entered the war in '41.
 I know that the war started in '39, but nobody really gave a rat's ass
 about what happened in Europe (largely, nobody does even today \SpecialChar \-
 except
 perhaps for the Normal Bureau).
 When the Japs hit us, the nation was shocked.
 Quite frankly, I wasn't: a leprechaun had invested heavily in rubber along
 with a Japanese cousin of his (in case you're wondering, they're called
 Kappa and they look like frogs or something equally slimy).
 It told me that the `big fellas that talk funny' (the Japanese) were going
 to war and that `pretty much anyone who reads a newspaper can tell'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suffice it to say, from then on it's history.
 The war and everything, the US having to pull out of the Philippines (which
 seemed like a pretty itneresting place without all the malaria \SpecialChar \-
 people
 crucified themselves for fun), it made me feel kind of bad.
 What mostly got to me was that I wasn't doing anything about it all.
 Nearly everyone else was caught up in this frenzy to get at the damn Japs;
 the girls loved the uniform and the government paid for everything, even
 the gun.
 It was the rad thing to do if you were a hot-blooded American; at least,
 I gathered as much.
 I had just finished school and me and the creatured in the mines had come
 to an understanding.
 I finally decided to enlist in the Army, because I always had a disdain
 about the sea, it being a big, salty, flat blue nothing that reeked of
 fish and people certainly always peed in if they had to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember my mother was all teary-eyed when they waved me goodbye at the
 train station.
 My father looked rather thoughtful and reserved; I later learned he had
 been terribly constipated that day.
 He did warn me not to get killed or do anything equally stupid because
 I would have to make up for all the shifts I'd lose in the mines when the
 war was over.
 Grandpa was there too and surprisingly enough a long list of long ago deceased
 members of my family, going all the way back to the first Barhoe that set
 foot on American soil, the honourable Jedediah Pontifer Barhow Sr.
 (supposedly a judge at a time when the judiciary system consisted of a
 set of scales and a few coins).
 It struck me as heartening that they all looked very emotional as far as
 dead people went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd never been farther than Cambridge, and I expected the whole trip would
 be sort of an adventure; I hadn't looked up the map though, wanting everything
 to be an exciting surprise.
 The train took us all the way to Camp Millard, Bucyrus.
 That took about a couple of hours, which wasn't much and it got me thinking
 why bother with the train at all.
 I guess it was because the U.S.
 Army was paying for a train ticket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I arrived at the boot camp, I was quickly disillusioned about what
 it meant to serve one's country: at first glance, it seemed that wars were
 fought in the latrines and the kitchens, while winning probably involved
 a lot of yelling and cussin' for no particular reason.
 The army had failed to turn me into a man (whatever that saying implied
 \SpecialChar \-
 I never got to five miles of a woman) and instead of shooting Japs or
 Krauts I was polishing boots and making sure I was clean-shaved, every
 damn morning.
 Boredom was a major issue; I rarely if ever saw dead or undead things during
 basic.
 A passing banshee had similar troubles; there was no point in trying to
 drive mentally unstable people crazy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a month of basic, I wasn't exactly itching for a fight, though a lot
 of my buddies were.
 The whole gun thing seemed to fit them nicely and many commented on how
 awesome the sound of the M1 Garand standard-issued rifle was.
 My personal opinion which was always a bad thing to share was that it was
 too loud and too heavy.
 A couple of Petersburg veterans' ghosts were always to be found at gun
 practice and insisted that I should be thanking God for that rifle; later
 on, I made similar statements.
 They were also very keen to admit that Lee was actually a nice guy and
 not at all uppity, especially for a dead Confederate General.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What started me on the very strange path I would take in the war and later
 on, was my specialty training.
 I was picked practically at random for specialty training as a signal corpsman.
 My squad leader had remarked, on paper no less which made it sacrosanct
 for the Army, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pvt.
 Barhoe's a wiry fella
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Someone in Personnel probably thought that he was referring to the wireless
 radio, so I was trained as a radio operator.
 Sadly, that involved polishing boots, shaving every single morning, cussin'
 and yelling just like basic training, the difference being that I was shown
 to a radio and told that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

that thing with the dials and all, that's a reey-dee-o
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through divine providence if nothing else, the radio came with a manual
 which was easy to familiarise myself with.
 I soon became an expert in communications, direction finding and signals
 intelligence, but no-one knew that because no-one had told me to use the
 radio, because we hadn't seen combat yet.
 Every NCO and officer always kept asking if I had any idea how much a radio
 cost, to which I promptly replied they had to ask battalion S4 for that;
 that earned me the nickname of `Wireass', apparently a portmanteau of `Wireless
' and `Wise Ass'.
 To this day, the reason eludes me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had been nearly three months since I had left home and joined up and
 a look at the news made me realise that we were losing the war without
 a lot of effort.
 I wasn't all that crazed about guns and explosions (or radios for that
 matter) but people getting killed for nothing felt wrong.
 It made think that the sooner the war ended, we'd all go home.
 I was surprised to learn the whole strategy of the war was based on the
 same premise; it was as if noone really wanted to do it, but doing it was
 the only way to make it stop.
 It sounded a bit crazy but everyone, even the dead people I asked said
 it made perfect sense if you looked past that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, I was itching to actually get in a fight and show them Japs
 what men were made of (war always provided opportunities to do that literally)
 as did most of the boys, although I really felt bad for them and wished
 there was some other way other than blowing each other up.
 The concensus among the veterans' ghosts was that it'd be pretty useful
 to talk about these things while one was still alive.
 On the upside, they suggested there was no language barrier in the afterworld
 so I thought maybe I could ask a Jap about his thoughts on the subject.
 It'd prove somewhat difficult talking to the dead while trying not to become
 one yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My feelings of expectation turned into excitement after the news about the
 battles at Coral Sea and Midway.
 It had been six months since the war had started and all I could think
 of was that the Navy was getting all the action (even though the sailor's
 outfit is actually rather overrated in terms of manliness \SpecialChar \-
 it includes
 wearing a sort of towel and a scarf).
 I was beginning to think that I had had just about enough of sending fake
 radio signals for practice to the room next door, when the higher-ups deemed
 that our time had come.
 We were being deployed in the Pacific and every man in the unit was properly
 ecstatic that we were about to get shot at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was shipped along with the rest of the 79th Signals Battalion to Hawaii,
 in preparation for some kind of operation against the Japs, codenamed Winter
 River (which to my resentment, did not involve snowmen, snowballs, or any
 form of snow other than the unfrozen variety: sea water).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I know that most people think that the Marine Corps lifted most of
 the weight in the battles in the Pacific and while that might be true,
 the Army saw its good share of fighting too.
 The Aussies were in a real bind at that time: if one looked past the fact
 that they inhabited a dry prison island, they weren't all that bad and
 we certainly had to stop the Japs from turning the Australians into a fish-eati
ng people.
 Their beer already had all the drinkable qualities of urine; raw fish would
 only make it worse.
 So we were going to help them defend their sand, and that somehow involved
 Papua New Guinea.
 I know it sounds like some kind of Japanese brand of bad whisky, but it's
 an island.
 Well, half of the island of New Guinea, which has nothing to do with Guinea
 which is in Africa and things like that always got me curious.
 Geography, just like dead people and paranormal incorporeal creatures in
 general, usually makes little or no sense at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all the men in the 79th Signals Battalion, I was the only one with any
 knowledge of Papuan.
 In fact, there were just three men in the whole U.S.
 Army that knew the language and seven who had heard of the island (including
 General MacArthur, of course).
 My commanding officer told me right off the bat he thought I was lying
 and I was just `trying to get some half-ass station somewhere off the grid,
 idly boning topless natives, eating mangoes and sunbathing drunk as a skunk'.
 He told me that even though he was a God-fearing man, God wouldn't be able
 to save me when he'd come looking for me when I'd be found wanting.
 For lack of a better word, it seemed to me he was jealous out of his mind,
 but without good reason.
 According to weather reports and brochure photos, the tropics seemed quite
 inviting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was sent to Milf's Bay on Papua New Guinea, attached to a company of Sea
 Bee engineers.
 For a couple of weeks, it felt again as if the war was just something we
 read about on the papers.
 The fact that we were all wearing army green, working in shifts, doing
 sentry duty and sleeping in tents seemed like a huge, funny coincidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the bombs and the artirelly shells started dropping right on top of
 us, whatever the fun remained in the soldiering affair started to leak
 like an old man's bladder.
 The amount of men praying in an otherwise awfully scenic beach somewhere
 in the South Pacific rose sharply while being shelled by the Japanese Imperial
 Navy (and I'm not talking about seashells).
 The whole debacle had me frozen stiff like a rabbit in front of a pair
 of headlights; I had a moment of revelation at that time, while we mostly
 sat around, digged in deep waiting for our ears to stop buzzing, our heads
 still attached if we could help it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I decided I would not idly sit around and wait to get blown up.
 I had to do something but what I was good at was talking with dead things,
 magical beasts, creatures from other planes of existence; that wasn't normal
 stuff, like shooting guns.
 I had no idea how this could prove helpful, but then I overheard my Captain
 on the wire with HQ: a relief force was on the way, but they had to know
 the exact location and disposition of the enemy forces to have any chance
 at being successful.
 They were looking for some people crazy enough to do some scouting and
 a radio operator to pass on the intelligence as it was being gathered \SpecialChar \-

 time was of the essence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was me.
 I volunteered screaming over the top of my lungs to be heard; my Captain's
 initial thought was I'd gone native and insane.
 In a way, that was to be expected from someone who knew Papuan, which in
 fact are about eight hundred different languages.
 The same night, during a lull from the naval bombardment, our make-shift
 scout platoon moved out into the jungles of Papua.
 Everyone complained about pulling the short straw, and how things could
 not be any more FUBAR.
 It was understandable; no-one liked to volunteer involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Green like the jungle we were staggering through, watching out for mines,
 poisonous snakes and the occasional group of jackanapes in heat, I got
 lucky and happened onto an ancient spirit of the jungle forest by the name
 of Jack, named by a castaway a long time ago.
 Jack manifested himself in all his glory, amidst swirling swaths of light
 and a host of entranced animals; he'd taken on the form a ghostly pale
 half-man, half-goat, wearing one of those exotic wooden masks but nothing
 like underpants.
 The sight was kind of spooky to the unwary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half the guys started shooting blindly and running off into random directions,
 setting off tripwires and mines and getting shot at, while the rest pretty
 much passed out.
 I introduced myself and told him he'd want to tone it down a bit in the
 future.
 I explained the precarious position we were in and how we didn't stand
 a chance if left to our own devices.
 I asked him if he could make the rounds on my behalf, just a look-see without
 showing off.
 He was happy to give me a hand; he kept complaining about the terrible
 noise the Japs' guns were making and how he missed the good old days when
 he did practical jokes to half-mad scurvy-ridden pirates, mostly involving
 illusions of loot and pointy, sharp bamboo sticks in deep holes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jack proved to be a treasure in hiding; with one sweep of his, in less than
 an hour, he'd seen everything there was to see on the island and off the
 shore.
 He'd also overheard invaluable enemy communications, including sake warming
 instructions and navy codes of the latest, Nazi-enabled Japanese encryption
 technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hurriedly transmitted the most essential stuff to HQ, and then roused
 the rest of the platoon.
 I assured them it was safe and I tried to sound convincing enough in that
 we had been gassed by the Japs with some hallucinogen.
 I also tried to explain that myself and the rest of the MIAs had managed
 to get a fairly good picture of the surrounding Japanese forces and all
 the intel we could ask for, before everyone else tripped on a mine, and
 blew up to smithereens, all at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an explanation noone dared to challenge; most thought that the MIAs
 probably went AWOL and that I made everything up, which was a good thing
 since that was a fine way to pretend we did everything they asked us to
 do.
 When we got back early in daybreak, I compiled everything Jack had told
 me into an intelligence report which I simply dumped on the command headquarter
's payroll officer's desk, the one desk where nothing goes unnoticed for
 long.
 Somehow, someone, was that desperate that blindly believed everything in
 that report was true.
 And that heppened to turn the whole battle in our favor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of days later the Japs had eased on the pressure after the Army
 Air Force struck key troop concentrations and the Navy finally got us some
 cover, urging the Japanese fleet components to turn tail and run.
 Jack had left me a `miss you' note in the form of an obscenely shaped mango
 and a anthropomorphic coconut; even for an ancient spirit, he seemed a
 bit disturbed and a lot more disturbing for my taste.
 It was with that particular mango in hand that I received an order to fly
 out immediately back to Brisbane for a debriefing.
 The order was signed by General MacArthur himself who stated in his post-script
um that he'd personally flay me to the bone if I failed to explain how I
 managed to compile that particular report that was key to winning that
 battle.

It was just then that I really wished with all my might that I were safely
 back home in Rendville and forced to eat lots of pepper for all the bad
 words that spewed forth from my mouth.
 I was in deep, deep trouble and that was opinion was only reinforced when
 I saw that a Colonel from General MacArthur's staff had been sent to escort
 me.
 It felt more like a pretty pissed off guard for most of the way, though
 I caught the Colonel looking at me from time to time with mixed feelings
 of compassion and awe.
 He never spoke a word to me.
 Perhaps, he was feeling constipated for the whole flight.

\begin_layout Standard
A few hours later I set foot in Australia; my inital reaction was a profound
 surprise and joy at the fact that civilisation seemed to continue to exist.
 I immediately experienced a new sense of wonder seeing that not everything
 in the world was painted or tinted green (though I must admit, Brisbane
 on a war footing did look greener than usual).
 The third surprise came after we had landed.
 The Colonel handed me over to a person of dubious character whose exact
 manner of affiliation with the Army and the world at large eludes me to
 this day.

\begin_layout Standard
I was standing on the tarmac, dressed in my best pressed khaki battle dress,
 squinting at the blistering sun.
 A short fellow with an abnormally pale complexion approached me, wearing
 aviation sunglasses and a thin smile on a crooked face underneath a brylcreem
 hairdo.

I didn't have the faintest of ideas what he was talking about.
 He just smiled congenially and led the way.
 I felt instantly compelled, even magnetised to follow him, though something
 kept telling me things were off by quite a bit.
 We kept on walking towards the exit in silence, and he kept on throwing
 weird looks at me.
 His sunglasses made the uncanny feeling uncannier.

 he said and waved our way right past the airfield's gate guard and onto
 a waiting Dodge sporting a large set of bars in addition to the usual bumper.
 I followed right behind as if in trance.
 I managed to ask him, with a befuddled, wavering voice:

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled widely and the feeling of terror was intensified.
 I was beginning to think I was about to get violently murdered somewhere
 behind a bush, when we arrived at a non-descript building without any guardpost
s or the like.
 It seemed innocuous enough to believe the man when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's get inside, shall we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I almost felt like kissing him, but a sense of manliness made me refrain.
 That, as well as the assorted skulls, sigils, statuettes and icons that
 lined up the entrance corridor.
 There was a rich tapestry that looked very familiar and old adorning the
 walls; something about Norsemen and ships.
 A waft of air smelled like candlewax and goat's cheese.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I followed the weird Australian as if enthralled by the austentious decor.
 I was certain I could smell incense.
 After a couple of inexplicable turns I swear I could also hear the sound
 of chanting, perhaps even some kind of opera.
 I was surprised - I mean, it was Australia after all.
 Before long, we reached the elevator and things became a bit more than
 simply weird when what looked like to be the definitive version of an Australia
n weirdo turned into a paranormal weirdo in the blink of an eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Australian fellow smiled with a very prominent set of fangs, a deathly-pale
 complexion and a very crisp, sharp and slick hairdo in a V-shape.
 Apart from the fact that the guy now looked pretty dead and going bald
 at the same time, there was an inescapable amount of worry that came with
 the realisation that he was a vampire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I freaked out mildly and pointed a finger of warning to him:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm very low on iron.

The vampire smiled congenially as he pressed the call button for the elevator

 I followed him inside with some level of apprehension.
 He pushed a button labeled

 and the elevator doors closed.
 We started going down.

No, that's true.

I'm surprised we're actually having this sort of civilized conversation.

\end_inset

That's right, that's how you captivate your victims..

 I'd met ghosts and spirits and their likes before, but not someone famous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's not entirely true,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as the elevator wailed and grinded its way down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're just being modest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said grinning like an idiot, to which the Count replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, I am undead.
 Not living, otherwise I'd be dead by now.
 Does that make sense to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Curiously enough, it does,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as I said as I nodded to myself furiously.
 I cleared my throat before asking what really bugged me.
 The Count's aura would not simply cancel that question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you going to suck me dry or not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Count looked at me like I had said something extremely distasteful and
 borderline incoherent.
 He simply shook his head with a frown and while he tried not to make much
 of a fuss about it, he put an extra couple of steps between us, however
 unlikely that could be possible inside the confines of an elevator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have this thing about personal space,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he explained which at the time seemed quite reasonable for someone who
 purportedly slept in a coffin.
 It turned out later he had considered filing for sexual harassment and
 that he actually never slept at all since he had no need for it being undead
 and all that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Oh, that!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a sudden feeling of relief before he added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's just a common misconception.

 he said, looking mildly annoyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied and the next moment the elevator stopped.
 The doors opened lazily and I saw a large round hall, brightly lit and
 spacious.
 There was a large seal on the marble floor that depicted an owl with a
 skull in its claws, weird symbols I'd never seen before drawn around in
 a circle and the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Occidere eam igni
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which simply put said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kill it with fire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The next thing that caught my attention was all the spirits and ghosts
 zipping about, dutifully pushing carts filled with stacks of what seemed
 to be paper reports.
 They barely spared a look my way and looked like in need of a long vacation,
 preferably not in the realm of the living, There were regular, living people
 of flesh and blood as well, but they were wearing army uniforms.
 The striking thing was they all looked exactly the same.
 Before I had a chance to ask who all these things and people were, Vlad
 took me gently by the arm and told me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Walk with me please.
 Just be careful not to step on the sigils on the floor,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Vlad pointing a finger to the weird symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Why is that?

 I asked him as I walked right behind him, taking in the surroundings, otherwise

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Could be? Is could be the right conditional?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked seemingly unphased by my bewilderment.

A growling voice suddenly boomed around the large hall as if from a set

 portrayals of Almighty God.

 Vlad looked visibly uncomfortable, his lips twitching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Enter!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came the answer vibrantly to a less than full-bodied knock and we promptly
 did so and stepped inside.
 Seeing the stars on the burly General's uniform made me salute briskly
 out of habit.
 He looked up from a file he was signing momentarily and returned the salute
 crisply.
 I couldn't help noticing the General's bushy, red beard; it was like a
 bush was sitting on the man's face.
 Even though beards had been against regulations since the Civil War, it
 somehow seemed completely, perhaps even fatally wrong to point that out.
\end_layout

Sir, Private Robbert Barhoe, reporting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said flatly and stood at attention.
 The General did not bother with me; instead his vehement stare was sqaurely
 aimed at Vlad.
 He afforded him less than half an eye.
 Vlad did not bother to salute, report or otherwise acknowledge the General's
 seniority, if not his existence at all.
 He was instead looking at a rather green and otherwise unassuming office
 plant as if it contained the Universe's biggest secret (which oddly, wasn't
 very far from the truth since that pot plant turned out to be a seedling
 from the Tree of Life).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Tepes, when you enter this office I expect you to salute and report, just

 said the General with a calm that his gleaming eyes belied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

At ease,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and flicked a wrist at me.
 Still addressing the vampire, he told him:

Pick up Excalibur and my laundry on your way out.
 Be careful, I hate stains and smudges.

\begin_layout Standard
Vlad had kept his quiet, as well as his eyes shut.
 He breathed deeply through flaring nostrils and seemed to consider a proper
 response.
 Before he could do so, the General said briskly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Very well, that will be all.
 Now buzz off.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vlad nodded, made some kind of hand gesture towards the General's vicinity,
 covered himself with his cape and disappeared in a puff of smoke as suddenly
 and sharply as in a bad, silent horror film.
 The General muttered something under his breath that sounded more like
 a gripy cat with a furball in its throat and turned to me with a somewhat
 forced smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and examined me with his stare for barely a moment.
 It was a very uncomfortable and indeed unpleasant moment.
 He then motioned me to sit down in a chair in front of his desk.
 I complied without a second's hesitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Vlad's a bit weird.

 I asked furrowing my brow and snapped my fingers a moment later.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh, because of the reflection,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said and the General nodded before asking me without further ado in a
 dead pan voice:
\end_layout

I was at a loss; I tried to stall by breathing, pouting my lips and looking
 deathly pale and ill, all to no avail.
 I was still thinking there was no easy way to explain to a US Army Major
 General that a spirit told me everything; most would assume I was drunk.
 Then again I had somehow forgotten all about the vampire, the underground
 headquarters filled with incorporeal creatures and a bearded King Arthur
 in uniform.

I'll tell you how: magic.

Well..
 I'm not sure, sir.

He pulled out a file from his desk and showed me: There were pictures of

 I even glimpsed a papal seal somewhere in there, which kind of freaked

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's doing pretty darn well, sir, if I may say so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which a logical answer if one took into account that the war involved almost
 everyone; it was called World War II after all even though Sweden managed
 to stay out of it.
 It must have been something in the fjords, or perhaps the herds of moose

 I said while I did not dare ask what was the first best thing.

I'll tell it to you straight, laddie.

Are you pure of heart?

\begin_layout Standard
I did not know how to answer that question.
 I really didn't and noone had actually asked me that, not even on church

Of course you are! It's probably the reason you're still sane,

Yes, sir.

Well, I'm sure it was a spur of the moment thing.

No, you already did, so the joke's on you if you think about it.

\begin_layout Chapter*
Chapter 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was looking outside the cockpit window, the red and brown sand of the
 Australian outback passing by without really doing so.
 No kangaroos in sight; just a lot of sand, the kind that grinded its way
 into everything, the kind of sand cheap pottery was made of.
 It was early September, which was springtime for Australia.
 That didn't mean much for most folks though; I'm pretty sure the man who
 invented calendars was a national hero.
 Australians only knew snow was a frozen form of water, and that was a vague
 notion in itself.
 If it wasn't for all the snow cones, the word would probably have been
 struck out of the dictionaries as something the British came up to scare
 people away from the Isles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was sitting inside a C-47 Skytrain, the workhorse of the Allied Forces
 when it came to aerial transport.
 I'd flown in a plane before, and I knew they weren't supposed to buck and
 sway this way and that every once so often.
 I thought trains offered a bumpy ride, but the Dakota was a proper shaker.
 For the most part sitting down on a pair of ropes disguised as a chair
 wasn't inviting.
 So I spent my time in the coockpit, snug in the middle between the two
 pilots who were curiously smiling every inch of the way even though there
 was nothing to smile at except clear blue skies and red dirt all around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were flying to an undisclosed location.
 I hoped it wasn't disclosed to me alone and that the pilots actually knew
 what they were doing.
 I carried a sealed folder containing my orders; it was not to be opened
 under any circumstances until I arrived at my destination under pain of
 death and a whole set of curses on my soul.
 Real, original curses; the ones that really worked and stuck beyond death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having an idea about how blant the afterlife really was - at least for most
 ordinary dead folk - (there's no beer, for one), I had no desire to step
 onto the other side just for curiosity's sake.
 But noone said anything about were I was going to train, and quite frankly,
 I hoped it had nothing to do with Australia.
 Wherever we were going to land, I knew it was a military place because
 the cargo bay was filled with cases of spam and beer, the raw basics needed
 for survival of a soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where exactly are we going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shouted to the pilots, hoping I'd make myself heard over the roaring,
 buzzing piston engines.
 They never answered or even really acknowledged me; they just kept flying
 and smiling as if they were lounging at the comfort of their home with
 a fine cigar in one hand and a glass of quality brandy in the other.
 I decided to ask them again, pretty sure they were simply somewhat absent-minde
d, absorbed by the great Australian outback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fellas,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said smiling myself, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where do you drop me off? You do know you're supposed to drop me off?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, no answer came.
 Just the same sparkling smiles, on the same fair-haired, flush-red faces,
 their eyes hidden behind the opaque aviation glasses.
 Flying caps on, headphones lying about their necks.
 They were just flying, and it should've struck me as odd in the first place,
 but I figured that's what Australian pilots do.
 I must've guessed it was pretty hard to keep flying straight with no point
 of reference in the ground other than the occasional anthill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was beginning to think they really, genuinely, didn't know I was on board
 their plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I tapped the co-pilot lightly on the shoulder.
 He didn't look very responsive, and just kept on smiling.
 I nudged him a little and still nothing; I bent closer and then I saw he
 was actually just sitting there, his hands wobbling on the stick.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked him and he kept on smiling uncannily.
 I turned around and saw the same kind of smile on the pilot.
 I touched their faces in a very creepy way, feeling their skin.
 It made all the right creases and wrinkles but I had a very strange feeling
 they weren't real; after all it had happened to me before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the constant, monotone buzzing of the engines I heard a distinctive
 sound, something between a call, a whisper and a whistle.
 Cooee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've heard it in a bar I think, right before I left Melbourne.
 I was pretty sure everything it wasn't just my idea because that would
 have meant I'd gone crazy a long time ago and being on a plane without
 being the pilot was bad timing for going haywire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I heard it again.
 Cooee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I turned around and saw this big, fat owl standing upside down
 from a cockpit railing, its head turned uncannily backwards as if someone
 had screwed it on wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cooee ya bloody yank,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the owl said and I must admit that had never happened to me before, even
 with the dead ones.
 I did not know how to properly address a talking owl so I opted for the
 usual Australian greeting.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

G'day, owl mate!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I shouted trying to sound cheery but the owl made a funny face, lost its
 footing and wobbled in the air for a second or so as it fell on the cockpit
 floor, flapping its wings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next moment or so it was back up in the air, constantly flapping its
 wings and twitching its head in what appeared to be agony.
 When it firmly clasped the railing on the cockpit ceiling, it made sure
 that I saw how it turned its head around slowly and told me with a raspy
 voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't yell.
 Ever again.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I simply nodded and before I even tried to say anything the owl spoke again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Scenes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 Bobby gripes about being on a ship (USS Unalaska).
 Bad weather, Task Force 88.
 Jap subs chasing them, foggy weather, no airplane cover
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Pretty much bobby is on his own, as a weird mostly unwanted guest.
 Sailors and officers equally dislike him.
 His only company is the ghost of the captain of the Boychimo, a ghost ship
 from 1921 - introduces himself as John Baez but has a peculiar accent -
 has a penchant for ballads and plays the lute - he is in fact Hendrik van
 der Decken (of Flying Dutchman fame).
 They talk about ships, mariners, sailors and how the flying dutchman is
 just a myth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Task Force 8 is attacked by torpedoes from japanese subs.
 The ship goes on alert and battle stations.
 Bobby looks outside and sees that japanese demons on narwhal wraiths are
 circling to attack and board every ship.
 He has to stop them and needs the John Baez's help.
 The ghost captain is loathe to help, as he is disenchanted by the sea and
 wants to finally set foot on land.
 Bobby makes a hasty promise to break Baez's curse; the ship captain is
 convinced because Bobby has the unique ability to talk to creatures from
 the underworld.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Bobby also has to convince the task force commander Jack Fischer-Price,
 a weird man by all accounts, who sees most of the battle as a wonderful
 game, threatening to lose ships and men.
 Bobby can see mad seals ghosts riding along the torpedoes and can steer
 the ships clear while Hendrik van der Decken fights off the jap demons
 who quickly try to board the Flying Dutchman.
 A classic pirate fight ensues.
 All this time Fischer-Price challenges Bobby to a game of Battleship, which
 Bobby is relucctant to play.
 The bridge crew help him win, desperate as they are and clearly willing
 to try anything other than Fischer-Price's lacklustre command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
5.
 Hendrik obliviates the jap demon-narwhal force, and Bobby is able to effectivel
y stter the ships out of trouble and sink the jap subs.
 The task force is safe and sound and Bobby is already building a legend
 around his name.
 A wild party ensues, van der Decken reminding Bobby of his promise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
6.
 When they reach Adak Harbor the following day, when the ship lands, Bobby
 along with the Admiral meet right on the docks with a strange Eskimo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
He suggests his name is Paqua.
 He has greenish skin and long hair and wears an Amauti , he is a Qalupalik
 ( a demon who was rumoured to steal childern and hiding them in his Amauti
 - a parka).
 He hands the admiral a piece of paper with the official report of what
 task force 88 enconutentered, making no mention of bobby.
 A special symbol and phonetic command at the end makes sure that everyone
 (or nearly everyone) will forget about bobby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
7.
 Then Qalupalik takes Bobby on a remote, solitary location where they hunt
 fish and Qalupalik explains they're hunting for a powerful Oni.
 Paqua trains Bobby for the fight, for it is not his place to face the Oni.
 He teaches him rituals and totem-making to be used as wards, while the
 actual killing has to be performed in the realm of the living, when the
 Oni (initally a badger) will be forced to take on a material aspect, as
 a fear-inspiring armor-wearing samurai 9 feet tall.
 In the ensuing battle, while the Oni invokes Bobby to a swordfight to the
 death, Bobby pulls out his Colt .45 issue and simply shoots the Oni dead.
 Paqua offers him fish and then sends him on his way for the real training
 in Montan to begin as this was only a test.

\begin_layout Standard
The flight throughout the tiny islands scattered in the Pacific was an entirely
 loathesome affair.
 Kooee was sleeping for the most part, while the homunculi kept on flying
 tirelessly, exactly like one would expect from inanimate pieces of flesh.
 They never spoke and simply grinned uncannily for the entire duration.
 All they could do apart from flying was to give the thumbs up to the ground
 crews and I had to handle the radio during approach and take-off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever we landed, I'd show ground crews the plane's manifest and orders
 and ask them to hurry up.
 Curiously no-one wondered about the pilots' well-being; it looked like
 they were used to crews flying for impossible hours on end, rotating constantly.
 Vegemite and beer, most importantly beer, seemed like the real currency
 used in these remote, God-forsaken places which consisted mostly of an
 airstrip and a few coconut trees sitting atop a huge coral.
 Vegemite was used as an engine lubricant, which I found somewhat distasteful.
 But the beer, however piss-poor Australian beer was, it always got us some
 preferrential treatment: We were always the first to get refueled and up
 in the air.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nearly three days of constant flying had made my head feel like a marmalade
 soup, thick and sweet, yet gross and not something one would order with
 excitement.
 I managed very little sleep in the rocking, swaying Skytrain and when I
 did, I usually woke up with another bump in the head.
 I asked Kooee at some point, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you manage to sleep upside-down?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to which he replied with a snide remark: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At least I'm not sleeping while awake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Badmouthing and ire manners aside, for a bird that was preternaturally linked
 to death, the flight was uneventful, boring and tiring, exactly the opposite
 of what people think flying is like.
 When we finally landed at Hawaii, Kooee insisted that he'd picked up the
 habit of sleeping upside-down from flying wombats.
 When I pointed out wombats weren't really a species of bat and they quite
 possibly resembled his definition of drop bears, he insisted that I 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

put some more effin' vegemite behind the ears
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and hoped we'd 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

never meet again
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 unless I were dead.
 All things considered, I was under the impression it all went rather well,
 on account of me being alive and all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I reported to some Navy Captain who \SpecialChar \-
 as is usually the case \SpecialChar \-
 had no idea
 who I was or what I was doing there.
 All he knew was that if my orders said I was shipping out to the Aleutians,
 I had to ship out with Task Force 88.
 That translated that I had more or less half an hour to get my act straight,
 board the USS Unalaska and report straight to the ship's botswain for some
 proper punishment.
 As he put it, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Son, you're so God-damn late I swear you're pregnant.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was dead tired by the time I got on-board the USS Unalaska.
 I felt fuzzy and weak; I remember I saw the ship's ladder being raised
 and the ship slowly sailing away from its berth, right before the ship's
 botswain started yelling at me in completely uncomprehensible Navy-speak
 lingo.
 Right before I passed out, I believe he called me 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a filthy dirt-rat not fit to mop up the sweat off a mule's ass.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I woke up later the next day, I was lying down in a hammock with an
 empty bucket by my side.
 I looked outside a tiny porthole and saw the horizon was acting funny,
 going up and down all the time.
 I soon realized it was the ship trying to weather the sea.
 I felt dizzy once again and pretty soon I found out there was wisdom in
 the placing of the bucket, but not in the bucket per se.
 It pretty soon contained a hefty amount of churned-out stomach contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship simply wouldn't stop rocking, but the feeling of seasickness subsided
 gradually.
 I figured that throwing up was all a matter of bad timing and how exhausted
 I must've been from all the flying.
 Pretty soon I felt ravenous and completely dry.
 I got up and sidestepped the bucket full of vomit when a sudden lurch of
 the ship made the bucket shift and spill its contents on my boots.
 It wasn't pleasant, but before anything else, I just had to drink some
 water and grab a bite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had expected I'd be bunking with some of the crew.
 Alas, I was my cabin's sole occupant; it was spartan but spacious.
 Nothing like the huge pile-up of sweaty bodies like on the ship to Australia
 on my first deployment.
 It looked like an officers' cabin.
 It was the first pleasant change ever since I'd kind of volunteered for
 this weird training (and I still wasn't sure about the volunteering bit).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got outside my cabin and guiltity scraped most of the vomit on my boots
 against a bulkhead, pretending it wasn't even mine.
 There was little ambient red light scattered in the restrictive corridors
 of the ship.
 I could hear hushed voices and the occasional laughter echoing faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I passed through lots of rooms and corridors and I saw lots of faces.
 But whenever I smiled in my most friendly manner, trying to make sure that
 no-one took notice of the boots, all I got was angry stares and a vengeful
 silence.
 I know I wasn't exactly a poster boy for some toothpaste brand, but I was't
 that repulsive, or at least no-one had told me straight in the face, especially
 not the ghosts and spirits that were pretty repulsive themselves most of
 the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was odd; I felt instantly alienated.
 At first I thought it was perhaps I was the only Army on-board.
 But pretty soon I ran onto some marines; I asked them where the mess hall
 was and one of them spat on my boots while the rest simply ignored me the
 best way they could.
 So it wasn't a service issue; everyone seemed to hate me equally, even
 the officers.
 Especially them.
 They wouldn't even yell at me like they were supposed to; they'd simply
 avoid me like the plague.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I found the mess hall by pure luck; I wandering about the ship, getting
 the silent, angry-stare treatment and the occasional spit when I happened
 upon one of the cooks, hauling a crate of vegemite.
 It was empty at that time; the clock on the far wall read twenty two hundred
 twenty two hours, which in normal time is almost half past ten in the evening
 and a bit funny as well.
 It was past the usual supper time, but my stomach wasn't tuned to any watch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stepped inside and saw a burly, scruffy looking man wearing a thick, fur-lined
 jacket hunched over a steamy cup, his face hidden from view.
 As I walked past him he didn't avoid me, which was a good thing; but the
 cooks did and simply disappeared, leaving me to my own devices when it
 came to filling my metal dish.
 That was also a good thing because I served myself a pile of brown goo
 with floating meat bits in it to my heart's delight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took another dish and filled it to the brim with some stucco-like substance
 that must've been mushed potatoes at some earlier point in time.
 Feeling reinvigorated at the mere prospect of having a full meal, even
 if it was mostly impossible to identify its true nature, I picked up a
 pitcher of water and wobbled my way towards the burly man; I felt adventurous,
 joyous and pretty curious.
 The ship wasn't rocking as much as it usually did, but still I had to put
 on a little bit of a balancing act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No-one likes you,

 the man spurted, and sipped from his cup.
 I found the bluntness somewhat unsettling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Except you, I hope,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I replied after some hesitation and smiled awkwardly, setting the pitcher
 down on a corner of the thin metal table with a clang.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not decided on that.
 You're strange,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and looked at me through a set of deep blue, gliterring eyes.
 His face was weather-worn, leathery and taut.
 A craggy beard covered most of it.
 His mouth curved in a peculiar fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you grinning at me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked him, because it did look like some sort of grin, and being alone
 in a room with a complete stranger grinning rarely went well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could be, could be,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sipped another mouthful from his cup, eying me oddly, running
 his tongue over his lips.
 The old, burly man was a weird enigma.
 I felt that I deserved some answers, so I stayed even though I had an odd
 feeling this could be my ass on the line.
 I picked up both trays and brought them to the table in a minor feat of
 balance.
 The ship was starting to misbehave against the churning, foaming sea, at
 least as much as I could tell through a starboard porthole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did I ask you to sit, boy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he told me with a gripe.
 He had a somewhat strange accent, but I couldn't quite pin down.
 It almost felt piraty, but I always wondered why pirates had to talk that
 way, at least in the movies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 We are after all, alone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

You don't know the meaning of the word, alone, boy.
 I haven't enjoyed the tenderness of a woman in oh, so many years,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a sudden bitterness and a face that suddenly looked about
 ready to break down in tears.
 He rubbed his hands together slowly, softly, as if beseeching the warmth
 of his now emptied cup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can understand that can be aggravating.
 I thought sailors are used to that sort of thing though.
 Part of the job, sort of,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said as I tried to entrap a piece of meat in the brown sludge-pulp in
 front of me that probably the cook had listed as `gravy' in the menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ya never can get used to it!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said slamming a fist to the table that send the pitcher of water tumbling
 over, spilling water all over the floor.
 I could see the old-timer's eyes shining brightly, his face now flush with
 anger.
 He seemed pissed, but thankfully, not literally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I guess you know better,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said and dug reverently into my tray, deciding rather late that it was
 too late to keep calm and quiet.
 His voice was unsettlingly serene again all of a sudden, like riding a
 wave time and again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I do know.
 But it's nice to have some company for a change.
 Even you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said somewhat miserably.
 I took it as a compliment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thanks.
 I guess,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said and cringed after swallowing; the so-called gravy tasted sour as
 vinegar.
 The cook was either a gourmet or the meat was off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't like the cuisine?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the old sailor and smiled somewhat affectionately.
 I simply nodded and forewent the gravy all together.
 I dug in the small pile of mashed potatoes; its consistency was not unlike
 cement.
 It surely made me feel I had a healthy foundation to go on for the rest
 of my day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm not much of an Army person either, to tell you the truth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You are special though,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and put a generous amount of tobacco in his pipe, stuffed it nicely
 and lit it up with a cloud of smoke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What makes you say that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said awkwardly, half-conscious that I was on a mission so secret I barely
 knew anything about it.
 If an old, half-crazy sailor could see it written all over me, then maybe
 it wasn't that secret, and maybe that'd get me killed real quick.
 There was a war going on, after all.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked with a furtive brow.

Because I'm dead.
 Well, not alive.
 Undead? Is that the correct word for it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

You don't look incorporeal to me,

 He did look all flesh and blood; I could tell, because the thin blue-grey

You could say that, yes.
 Not all ghosts and spirits or creatures of the afterworld are one and the

\begin_layout Standard

He hesitated for a moment, like an old man trying to figure out what was

No, no.
 One might perceive it as a compliment though; it's a ghost thing.
 It's what ghosts produce in lieu of bodily fluids,

 Everyone was up and about, running like hell, to get to their stations.

\begin_layout Standard
There was a lot of repetitive shouting and the kinds of sounds usually associate
d with a ship on full alert: the clangs of metal, the shouts of chiefs and
