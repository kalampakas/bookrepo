Ever since I was about five years old, about the time when most kids show
 each other their God-given implement of peeing, their gender awareness
 a new and exciting thing to share with the world at large, I saw things.
 Strange, mysterious, butt-ugly and downright scary things that mostly lacked
 a body in any sense of the word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I once told my teacher, Mrs.
 Resenbaum that some scary looking ghost of a one-eyed person who might've
 been a pirate when alive was ogling her in a very sexual though quite incorpore
al way.
 Of course, I was only twelve at the time so I just said,

\begin_layout Standard
As the natural course of events ran through, I got spanked and she got raped
 by the ghost of a black (what they called negro back then) miner.
 Or that's what the papers in Perry County Ohio reported that she insisted
 telling the good doctors at the Ridges even while they fastened her straightjac
ket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call them what you will, ghosts, spirits, demons; any name is just as good
 cause it sometimes just doesn't do these creatures justice.
 Whatever you want to call them, I had the dubious privilege of having some
 sort of affinity with the otherworld, the afterlife, the world of the spirits
 if you will.
 Some would call it a gift, others would call it a curse.
 I certainly had no name for it.
 It was as natural to me as sight and the fact that old people smelled weird.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Around where I grew up though, Rendville, Ohio, seeing dead things meant
 that I was just a boy with a wild imagination that needed some good ol'
 spanking with a wet plank, even if I was an only child.
 That's what I mostly got every once so often I couldn't keep my mouth shut
 'cause

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My father was a miner, my uncle too; grandpa as well.
 Almost everyone in Rendville was a miner, except for the whores and the
 bartenders.
 And Mr.
 Calliburton, the grocer.
 At an early age I realised being a miner was just as natural as the ghosts
 and the other weird stuff that I alone could see and talk to.
 I began working at the mines before I finished school, because the times
 were hard and bread, lard and meat didn't come free and something about
 Roosevelt being such 'a god-damn two-nickel sunava-', which is as far as
 I ever heard my father swear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once I got into the mining business, I got the hang of it really fast.
 All you had to do was keep digging and chipping stone and blowing up new
 tunnels all day long, six days a week, twelve hours a day.
 There was a lot of soot involved and most of the days I missed the sun,
 but it felt exciting.
 It wasn't just my hard-working, God-fearing, swamp-mouthed colleagues in
 the coal extraction business that helped me ease into the job; it was the
 sheer number of dead things that would talk to me and try to claw and possess
 their way past me, the number of heads and assorted tails and life-threatening
 incorporeal body parts growing the deeper one delved into the bosom of
 the earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just as well though because I had seen the shittiest, weirdest, most
 awful, God-forlorn things from the other side that I just felt like I couldn't
 be surprised anymore.
 It came handy, really.
 When one of them tried to possess a man, I gave it the stare and it just
 felt so bad about it the next day it got me candy (well, maggots, but that's
 candy for undead things and their ilk).
 When they plotted about haunting the mines so they could turn them into
 a mini-golf club, I read them their rites, God bless my mother's soul,
 and that made them shrill and shriek and go back to playing poker with
 the dwarves really deep down (who, I might add, are really not as hairy
 as people think they are).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yup, it was thanks to my mother that I could turn most evil spirits away
 with a prayer.
 Or a nod, a flick of the wrist and sometimes just breathing their way.
 She took me to church, insisted that I become an altar boy, and each andevery
 time I swore she made sure I had my share of pepper and read the Good Book
 aloud.
 And the Prayers.
 And the writings of Thomas Aquinas.
 And the latest Opus Dei journal.
 And every kind of book labeled Religion at the school library.
 She used to say that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

only God can save your soul, Robert Clovis Barhoe, you wicked devil's child!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I still can't believe how literally right she was without ever knowing
 it.
 I also miss her raspberry pie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That reading thing kind of grew on me and on Sundays, right after church,
 I would take my bike to New Lexington and get on the bus to Cambridge,
 which sadly wasn't all that active, paranormally speaking.
 As a lonely poltergeist put it, 'Cambridge? Deader than a dodo, deader
 than me'.
 Once I realised it wasn't the prestigious site of knowledge and lore famous
 around the world that I had hoped for, I settled for the homely library
 of St.
 Benedict's School, whose sole staff member at the time, a centenarian by
 the name of Mr.
 Galsworthy, was kind enough to leave at my disposal since the library was
 mostly empty on Sundays.
 The old man, God bless his soul, snored heavily.
 He died peacefully on the job too having fallen asleep, much like every
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Life went on uneventfully for some time.
 I worked in the mines and kept them from being haunted with very little
 effort.
 Sometimes I helped the occasional exorcist or vampire hunter that seemed
 to be at a loss around our parts (you won't believe how amateurish these
 kind of people are; they think vampires, of all paranormal creatures, are
 nocturnal).
 And in between, I discovered old and exotic tomes at the library, some
 containing surprisingly lewd pictures and others boring me to death with
 their Latin.
 I also picked up a couple of languages on the way: not only Latin, which
 seemed essential at first, but useful stuff nonetheless like Tauric and
 Cimmeric.
 I generally had a blast back in those days, eating Sundaes on Sundays and
 exchanging thoughts and ideas on the medicinal and religious usage of hallucino
gens from first-hand accounts of long-deceased native indians, i.e.
 their ghosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that changed dramatically when we entered the war in '41.
 I know that the war started in '39, but nobody really gave a rat's ass
 about what happened in Europe (largely, nobody does even today).
 When the Japs hit us, the nation was shocked.
 Quite frankly, I wasn't because a leprechaun who had invested heavily in
 rubber along with a Japanese cousin of his (in case you're wondering, they're
 called Kappa and they look like frogs or something equally slimy) told
 me that the `big fellas' (the Japanese) were going to war and `pretty much
 anyone who reads a newspaper can tell'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suffice it to say, from then on things are known history, but I felt kind
 of bad about not doing anything about it.
 I finally decided to enlist in the Army, because I always had a disdain
 about the sea, it being a big, salty, flat blue nothing that reeked of
 fish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I remember Mother was all teary-eyed when they waved me goodbye at the train
 station and father looked rather thoughtful and reserved; I later learned
 he had been terribly constipated that day.
 He did warn me not to get killed or do anything equally stupid because
 I would have to make up for all the shifts I'd lose in the mines when the
 war was over.
 Grandpa was there too and surprisingly enough a long list of long ago deceased
 members of my family, going all the way back to the first Barhoe that set
 foot on American soil, the honourable Jedediah Pontifer Barhow Sr.
 (supposedly a judge at a time when the judiciary system consisted of a
 set of scales and a couple of coins).
 It struck me as heartening that they all looked very emotional for dead
 people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I arrived at boot camp though, I was quickly disillusioned about what
 it meant to serve ones country: at first glance, it seemed that wars were
 fought in the latrines and the kitchens, while winning probably involved
 a lot of yelling and cussin' for no particular reason.
 The army had failed to turn me into a man (whatever the saying implies)
 and instead of shooting Japs or Krauts I was polishing boots and making
 sure I was clean shaved, every damn morning.
 I rarely if ever saw dead or undead things during basic; a passing banshee
 told me there was no point in trying to drive already half-insane people
 crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once basic was complete, I was picked practically at random for specialty
 training as a signal corpsman because my squad leader had remarked, on
 paper, which made it sacrosanct for the Army, that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Someone in Personnel thought that was some sort of foreign language probably,
 so I was trained as a radio operator.
 Sadly, that involved polishing boots, shaving every single morning, cussin'
 and yelling just like basic training, the difference being that I was shown
 to a radio and told that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

that with the dials and all, that's a reey-dee-o
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through divine providence seemingly, it came with a manual which was easy
 to familiarise myself with.
 I soon became an expert in communication, direction finding and signals
 intelligence, but no-one knew that because no-one had told me to use the
 radio, because we hadn't seen combat yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost three months after I had left home and joined up, I realised that
 until that time we were losing the war without a lot of effort.
 I was itching to actually get in a fight and show them Japs what men are
 made of (sometimes literally) as did most of the boys, although I really
 felt bad for them and wished there was some other away other than blowing
 each other up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Expectation turned into excitement after the news about the battles at Coral
 Sea and Midway.
 It had been six months since the war had started and all I could think
 of was that the Navy was getting all the action (even though the sailor's
 outfit is actually rather overrated in terms of manliness).
 I was beginning to think that I had just about enough of sending fake signals
 for practice to the room next door, when the higher-ups deemed that our
 time had come and I was shipped along with the rest of the 79th Signals
 Battalion to Hawaii, in preparation for some kind of operation against
 the Japs, codenamed Winter River (which to my resentment, did not involve
 snowmen, snowballs, or any form of snow other than the unfrozen one, water).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I know that most people think that the Marine Corps lifted most of
 the weight in the battles in the Pacific, and while that might be true,
 the Army had its share too.
 The Aussies were in a real bind, and if you looked past the fact that they
 inhabited a dry prison island, they weren't all that bad and we certainly
 shouldn't let the Japs turn them into a fish-eating people with beer that
 had all the drinkable qualities of urine.
 So we were going to help them, and that somehow involved Papua New Guinea.
 I know it sounds like some kind of Japanese brand of bad whisky, but it's
 an island.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all the men in the 79th Signals Battalion, I was the only one with any
 knowledge of Papuan.
 In fact, there were just three men in the whole U.S.
 Army that knew the language and seven who had heard of the island (including
 General MacArthur, of course).
 My commanding officer told me right off the bat he thought I was lying
 and I was just 'trying to get some half-ass station somewhere off the grid,
 idly boning topless natives, eating mangoes and having sunbaths'.
 He told me that even though he was a God-fearing man, God wouldn't be able
 to save me when he'd come looking for me when I'd be found wanting.
 For lack of a better word he was jealous out of his mind, but without good
 reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was sent to Milf's Bay on Papua New Guinea, attached to a company of engineers.
 For a couple of weeks, it felt again as if the war was just something we
 read about on the papers.
 The fact that we were all wearing army green, working in shifts, doing
 sentry duty and sleeping in tents seemed like a huge, funny coincidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the bombs and shells started dropping, the fun started to leak like
 an old man's bladder.
 Just when I thought I was about to buy the proverbial farm in an otherwise
 awfully scenic beach somewhere in the South Pacific, while being shelled
 by the Japanese Imperial Navy (and I'm not talking about seashells) I had
 a moment of revelation.
 I would not idly sit around and wait to get blown up.
 I had to do something but what I was good at was talking with dead things
 and magical beasts, not shooting guns.
 I had no idea how this could prove helpful, but then I overheard my Captain
 on the wire with HQ: a relief force was on the way, but they had to know
 the exact location and disposition of the enemy forces to have any chances
 of success.
 They were looking for some people crazy enough to do some scouting and
 a radio operator to pass on the intelligence as it was being gathered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was me.
 I volunteered, so my Captain's initial reaction was I'd gone barmy.
 In a way, that was to be expected from someone who knew Papua.
 The same night, in a lull from the naval bombardment our make-shift scout
 platoon moved out into the jungles of Papua.
 Everyone was complaining about pulling the short straw, and how things
 could not get any more FUBAR.
 But then I got lucky and happened onto an ancient spirit of the jungle
 forest by the name of Jack (he'd gotten that name from a castaway a long
 time ago).
 Jack manifested himself in all his glory, swirling swaths of light and
 a host of entranced animals, a ghostly pale half-man, half-animal form,
 the works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half the guys started running off into random directions, setting off tripwires
 and mines while the rest pretty much fell unconscious and collapsed.
 I introduced myself and told him he'd want to tone it down a bit in the
 future; other than I explained if he could make the rounds on my behalf.
 He was happy to give me a hand; he kept complaining about the terrible
 noise the Japs' guns were making and how he missed the good old days when
 he did practical jokes to half-mad scurvy-ridden pirates, mostly involving
 illusions of loot and pointy, sharp bamboo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jack was a treasure in hiding; with one sweep of his, in less than an hour,
 he'd seen everything there was to see on the island and off the shore.
 He'd also overheard invaluable enemy communications, including sake warming
 instructions and navy codes of the latest, highest Nazi-enabled Japanese
 encryption technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hurriedly transmitted the most essential stuff to HQ, and then roused
 the rest of the platoon.
 I tried to sound convincing enough in that we had been tear-gassed by the
 Japs, but myself and the rest of the MIAs had managed to get a fairly good
 picture of the surrounding Japanese forces before everyone else tripped
 on a mine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an explanation noone dared to challenge; when we got back early in
 daybreak, I compiled everything Jack had told me into an intelligence report
 which I simply dumped on the command headquarter's payroll officer's desk,
 where nothing goes unnoticed ever.
 Somehow, someone, was that desperate that blindly believed everything in
 that report was true.
 And that turned the whole battle in our favor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of days later the Japs had eased on the pressure after the army
 air force struck key troop concentrations and the navy finally got us some
 cover, urging their fleet components to turn tail.
 Jack had left me a 'miss you' note in the form of an obscenely shaped mango
 and a anthropomorphic coconut; even for an ancient spirit, he seemed a
 bit disturbing for my taste.
 It was with that mango in hand that I received an order to fly out immediately
 back to Brisbane for a debriefing.
 The order was signed by General MacArthur himself who stated in his post-script
um that he'd personally flay me to the bone if I failed to explain how I
 broke the Japs' code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just then that I really wished with all my might that I were safely
 back home in Rendville, made to eat lots of pepper for all the bad words
 that came forth from my mouth.
 I was in deep, deep trouble and that was opinion was only reinforced when
 I saw that a Colonel from MacArthur's staff had been sent to escort me
 in my trip.
 It felt more like a guard for most of the way, though I caught the Colonel
 viewing me at times with mixed feelings of compassion and awe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few hours later I was in Australia; my inital reaction was a profound
 surprise and joy at the fact that civilisation seemed to continue to exist.
 Then I experienced a new sense of wonder at the fact that not everything
 in the world was painted or tinted green (though I must admit, Brisbane
 on a war footing did look greener than usual).
 The third surprise was the fact that when we landed, the Colonel handed
 me over to a person of dubious character whose affiliation with the Army
 and the world at large eludes me to this day.
 Still standing on the tarmac, a short fellow with a weird complexion approached
 me, wearing aviation sunglasses and a thin smile.

I almost felt like kissing him, but a sense of manliness made me refrain.

I followed the weird australian as if enthralled by the austentious decor.
 I was certain I could smell incense.
 After a couple of inexplicable turns I swear I could also hear the sound
 of chanting.
 Perhaps even some Handel.
 Then we reached the elevator and things became a bit more than simply weird
 when what looked like to be the definitive version of an Australian weirdo
 turned into a paranormal weirdo in the blink of an eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Australian fellow smiled with a very prominent set of fangs, a deathly-pale
 complexion and a very crisp, sharp and slick hairdo in a V-shape.
 Apart from the fact the man looked pretty dead and going bald at the same
 time, there was an inescapable amount of worry that came with the realisation
 that he was a vampire.

No, that's true.
 The act is for the locals mostly, as well as everyone else who is not used

Vlad? Vlad Tepes, the Count Dracula?

The same,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, obviously enjoying the effect his name had on people, though I
 wasn't sure he was able to socialise much during the day at least.
 He led me into the elevator with a gesture of his hand and his gaze alone.
 As he entered the elevator behind me I couldn't help asking:

Why am I so calm about this?

That's right, that's how you captivate your victims..

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

You're just being modest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said grinning like an idiot, to which the Count replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I mean, I'm undead.
 Not living, otherwise I'd be dead by now.
 Does that make sense to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Curiously enough, it does,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 as I said as I nodded to myself furiously.
 I cleared my throat before asking what really bugged me and the Count's
 aura would not simply cancel:
\end_layout

Are you going to suck me dry or not?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The Count looked at me like I had said something extremely distasteful and
 borderline incoherent.
 He simply shook his head with a frown and while he tried not to make much
 of a fuss about it, he put an extra couple of steps between us, however
 unlikely that could be possible inside the confines of an elevator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have this thing about personal space,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he explained which at the time seemed quite reasonable for someone who
 purportedly slept in a coffin.
 It turned out later he had considered filing for sexual harassment and
 that he actually never slept at all since he had no need for it being undead
 and all that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Oh, that!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said with a sudden feeling of relief before he added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's just a common misconception.
 You see, it dates back to when I tortured and brutally murdered people

Good grief, no! All that iron makes it tangy.

\end_inset

 he said, looking mildly annoyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied and the next moment the elevator stopped.
 The doors opened lazily and I saw a large round hall, brightly lit and
 spacious.
 There was a large seal on the marble floor that depicted an owl with a
 skull in its claws, weird symbols I'd never seen before drawn around in
 a circle and the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Occidere eam igni
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which simply put said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kill it with fire
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The next thing that caught my attention was all the spirits and ghosts
 zipping about, dutifully pushing carts filled with stacks of what seemed
 to be paper reports.
 They barely spared a look my way and looked like in need of a long vacation,
 preferably not in the realm of the living, There were regular, living people
 of flesh and blood as well, but they were wearing army uniforms.
 The striking thing was they all looked exactly the same.
 Before I had a chance to ask who all these things and people were, Vlad
 took me gently by the arm and told me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Walk with me please.
 Just be careful not to step on the sigils on the floor,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Vlad pointing a finger to the weird symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why is that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked him as I walked right behind him, taking in the surroundings, otherwise
 dull except for a large poster of a voluptuous pinup girl on the far wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They might be trapped,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said smiling nonchalantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I asked incredulously even while my eyes traced the floor with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could be? Is could be the right conditional?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked seemingly unphased by my bewilderment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're joking, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No, we simply don't know.
 We build this place around the sigils.

A growling voice suddenly boomed around the large hall from some set of
 unseen speakers.
 It had all the qualities usually exhibited by bears trained in classical
 theater, benevolent giants, living waterfalls and most portrayals of Almighty
 God.
\end_layout

 replied Vlad with some effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes, what?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked the voice with authority.
 Vlad looked visibly uncomfortable, his lips twitching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Vlad and led me down the hall, in front of a door with a strange name
 written across it: Maj.
 Gen.
 A.
 Pendragon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is that who I think it says he is?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I'm afraid so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Vlad and knocked on the door perfunctorily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Enter!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came the answer to the knock and we promptly did so and stepped inside.
 Seeing the stars on the burly General's uniform made me salute briskly
 out of habit.
 He looked up from a file he was signing momentarily and saluted back.
 I couldn't help noticing the General's bushy, red beard and even though
 beards had been against regulations since the Civil War, it somehow seemed
 completely and fatally wrong to mess with this General's beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir, Private Robbert Barhoe, reports,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said flatly and stood at attention.
 The General though was staring at Vlad with less than half an eye.
 Vlad did not bother to salute, report or otherwise acknowledge the General's
 seniority, if not existence.
 He was instead looking at a pot plant as if it contained the Universe's
 biggest secret (which oddly, wasn't very far from the truth since that
 pot plant turned out to be the Tree of Life).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tepes, when you enter this office I expect you to salute and report, just
 like any other enlisted man and officer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the General with a calm that his gleaming eyes belied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At ease,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he sent and flicked his wrist at me.
 Still addressing the vampire, he told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Pick up Excalibur and my laundry on your way out.
 Be careful, I hate stains and smudges.
 I just had it polished.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vlad had kept his quiet, as well as his eyes shut.
 He breathed deeply through flaring nostrils and seemed to consider a proper
 response.
 Before he could do so, the General said briskly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good, now buzz off.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vlad nodded, made some kind of hand gesture towards the General's vicinity,
 covered himself with his cape and disappeared in a puff of smoke as suddenly
 and sharply as in a bad, mute horror film.
 The General muttered something under his breath that sounded more like
 a cat with a furball in its throat and turned to me with a somewhat forced
 smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and examined me with his stare for barely a moment.
 It felt like a very uncomfortable and unpleasant moment.
 He then motioned me to sit down in a chair in front of his desk.
 He then told me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Vlad's a bit weird.
 He has a penchant for theatrics and drama.
 I hear he likes to goes to barbers' shops just to freak them out.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why? Oh, because of the reflection,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said and the General nodded before asking me in a dead pan voice:
\end_layout

How did you decode the Japanese transmissions?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was at a loss; I tried to stall by breathing, pouting my lips and looking
 deathly pale and ill, all to no avail.
 I was still thinking there was no easy way to explain to a US Army Major
 General that a spirit told me everything; most would assume I was drunk.
 Then again I had somehow forgotten all about the vampire, the underground
 headquarters filled with incorporeal creatures and a bearded King Arthur
 in uniform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll tell you how: magic.
 There's no other way.
 And I know, because that's what we do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the General, replying to his question that had proven to be a rhetorical
 one.
