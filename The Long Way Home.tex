\maketitle
The sound of small, shuffling feet roused Penthesileia from an uneasy,
troubled sleep. She rolled to the other side of her bed and slowly
opened her eyes; she saw Heraclea standing by the bedside in the dim
blueish light of the glowstrips. The child's face was pale white and
taut with fright. Her mouth was half-open, as if her scream had been
sucked into the silent void.

``Hush now, child. Hush and worry not. I'm here now,'' whispered
Penthesileia in her daughter's ear, her arms wrapped around the little
girl like a warm coccoon.

She felt Heraclea's shallow breath and her fragile body's tremors;
chills ran down her spine.

\textit{There's no end to the nightmares}, she thought.

``Where is father? I want to see him,'' said Heraclea stifling a
sob, barely able to contain a rush of tears. She rubbed a runny nose
against her mother's chest and looked at her with heart-melting innocence.

``He's in orbit my love, you know that already. Come, lay beside
me and nothing will hurt you, I promise,'' said Penthesileia but
her eyes grew distant suddenly. She stared at a pot plant behind her
daughter's back. It had large drooped leaves and creamy rose buds;
it served no purpose other than beautification. It was contraband.

A thought entered her mind unbidden: \textit{He could be frozen stiff,
floating outside an airlock. Nothing will hurt you, Hera.} 

``Father promised too,'' said the child, her voice fading away crestfallen.

``Your father loves you more than anything,'' said Penthesileia
and swallowed hard. She added hastily, and even tried to smile reassuringly:

``He's coming soon, Hera.''

She heard her falsetto voice through her own ears; the lie pierced
her soul like a blade made of glass, shattering inside.

She closed her eyes and grabbed Heraclea from her shoulders, as if
trying to fix her to the floor:

``Your father and I love you more than the stars in the night sky;
more than the galaxy and the universe itself. Do you understand that,
Hera? Remember that; more than life, love.''

What is life worth anyway on this forsaken rock, she thought and kissed
her daughter's forehead, feeling the cold taste of dried sweat. The
child looked at her expectantly, fear creasing her brow:

``I love you too mother. But I'm scared.''

``That's alright, Hera. Everyone's scared. We're only human,'' said
Penthesileia with a slight sigh and looked outside their small window
pane; the moons were fading away, while a trio of suns came rising
spectacularly, the horizon an unearthly rainbow of golden-hued colors.

``What do you mean, mother?'' asked Heraclea puzzled, the fear subsiding.

``Nothing love. Come here now. Lay on the bed, close your eyes and
think of riding the sail.''

\textit{Think of merrier times, }she thought and shuddered.\textit{
For the child's sake or for my own?}

``And father at the helm?'' asked the little girl as she climbed
eagerly on the bed, a carefree smile sheepishly forming on her mouth.

``Always, my love,'' said Penthesileia. She clutched her daughter
in her arms like a hawk-mother and felt a tear ran down her cheek.

She looked through her window at the rich, crystal clear horizon.
The break of dawn was at hand; she saw the Hyperion shining brightly,
moving slowly across the sky like a star with purpose.

\textit{How can a star be so unforgiving?}

``They say you speak heresy.''

``I speak my mind, that is all.''

``They say your tongue's as dangerous as any gun or sword.''

``Did they say to whom?''

``You intrigue me, Pedagogue. You're a peculiar man.''

``And you're strangely inquisitive for a simple guard.''

``Head of the guards.''

``Head? There are no guards except you. Does the title make you feel
you're rising up in the world then?''

``A man can only hope for the best.''

``That was my crime as well.''

``I merely entertain my time, Pedagogue. Save your words for the
Tribunal.''

``I find it strange that they haven't gagged my mouth.''

``Say what you will now that you pose no danger to children.''

``Would you listen to what I have to say then?''

``I've heard madmen and heretics muse about the end of days and the
fall of the firmament before. I sometimes think back to some of it
and I smile. It is an otherwise unfulfilling job.''

``Allow me then.''

The guard nodded and sat back on his desk's hovering chair. From across
the hallway, a man in a holding cell cried out hysterically:

``He's a demon! An alien if I've ever seen one!''

``If that's true, our work here is done, isn't it?''

``He'll boil your mind away with his words! I've seen it, I have!''

``Right next to the miners you spaced, I'm sure. Save it, Barabbas,''
said the guard and flicking a switch on his desk all sound from Barabba's
cell was nullified. He yelled and threw himself around the cell until
he realised it was futile and simply sat himself down, muttering to
himself.

``Fourteen people spaced out on the belt. Miners and their families.
He said he had to stop them from killing the asteroid.''

``Has he been sentenced?''

``Not yet, but it's a clear cut case. He can't be slaved, he's paranoid;
it's either the airlock or the compost in the Fields. What would you
pick?''

``I'd prefer to be slaved.''

``That's not life either, Pedagogue. Surely you know that.''

``Maybe somehow I can talk some sense into them all.''

``You're starting to sound just as paranoid as Barabbas.''

``Am I? I've wondered myself over the years, but it's not me. It's
them.''

``You're doing it already, aren't you? You are a cunning one.''

``I'm simply speaking my mind.''

``I can see now where the danger lies. You seem so benign, but your
words are designed to spread doubt.''

``Tell me, really, for I haven't been imprisoned before: What do
you actually do around here? This prison could run itself, could it
not?''

``That's true enough. In truth, I'm what you could call your advocate.''

``I thought the Tribunal had no need of those.''

``I wouldn't know. Who can tell what goes on in their minds. Perhaps
they find it amusing. Perhaps they're bored.''

``They are machines. They have no mind to speak of. They have no
soul to be bored to death.''

``You don't like them very much, do you? We owe everything we've
accomplished to them, don't we? Our very existence.''

``I refuse to believe that. We owe nothing to ancient machines built
to rule our lives in the name of mankind.''

``I've heard about your kind. The philosophers, is that what you
call yourselves?''

``You've hardly heard the notion, haven't you? That's their doing.
Keeping knowledge locked away; nothing but the maths and science of
engineering that we need to build more refineries, more mines, more
ships. So we can then launch blindly into the galaxy, and turn more
of it into resources, materials. Eat away at it, expanding like a
scourge, a colourless plague.''

``I can't see why that should bother you. What else is the universe
there for?''

``Oh, how the mighty have fallen low. To believe we once set ourselves
towards the star with a single dream, a wonderful purpose. And how
we've allowed ourselves to drift away, fall into such a lonely, deaf
and mute abyss.''

``Your words make little sense; you talk as if in riddles. You puzzle
me pedagogue. I know not what to really make of you.''

``If you haven't already seen it yourself, there's little I could
say to make you see the truth of it.''

``Is that why you told the children? Is that what you taught them?
Is that what hoped to seed in their hearts and minds? Dissidence,
rebellion? Whatever for, Pedagogue? I do not understand. Are we not
cared for? Are we not protected? Do we not live comfortable, sheltered
lives? Here we are, thousands of light years away from our homeworld,
claiming new worlds, seeking intelligent life, unleashing humanity
into the stars. What more could a man ask for?''

``Choice, for one. Freedom. Expression. Art, passion, love and so
many more of the things we've let them erase from our memories and
theirs!''

``You speak of love? Then you've also..''

``My wife has given birth to a child.''

``It doesn't show up on your record. That means you have..''

``We fell in love and had intercourse. I impregnated her and she
gave birth to my daughter.''

``Weren't you allotted a child?''

``We wished for our child to be human. To be born like a human.''

``I don't think I'll be able to support a hint of innocence in you.
Not even some sort of levity. If all you ever did was talk, that would
be fine. But a lawless child..''

``Perhaps the State should make us infertile. Or even neutered.''

``We need the genetic pool, you know that. And neutering alters physiology,
there are neurochemical imbalances to be considered. You act like
a child! The breeding process hasn't changed in thousands of years!
The whole population descended from merely twenty forefathers and
yet.. No chronic diseases, no deformities, no lesser beings. Humans!
Modified yes, but bettered!''

``You have never loved. Haven't you felt the need? Haven't you had
the urge to answer those feelings inside?''

``A waste of time and resources. This is all about survival. I'm
surprised that a look around you hasn't convinced you how important
that is.''

```I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, rivers in the desert.'''

``How would you do that without the tells, without following the
process that's been laid out?''

``You have no idea how old that saying is, have you?''

``You vex me Pedagogue. You try to mock me and our whole way of life.
I thought you were simply living some sort of fantasy, playing a weird
little game. But no; you are indeed dangerous to the society. I've
made up my mind; I will cast my vote that you be turned over to the
Fields. Become somthing productive, even after your death.''

``Why not slaved to them?''

The guard remained silent for a moment. He reluctantly said:

``I fear you might pollute them.''

``Have I polluted you?''

The guard flicked another switch on his desk and silence dominated
the holding area. No sound came from the Pedagogue's cell. It wasn't
really necessary because the Pedagogue fell silent; there was nothing
more for him to say.
