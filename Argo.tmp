<!--l. 58--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The sound of small, shuffling feet roused Penthesileia from an
uneasy, troubled sleep. She rolled to the other side of her bed and
slowly opened her eyes; she saw Heraclea standing by the
bedside in the dim blueish light of the glowstrips. The child&#x2019;s
face was pale white and taut with fright. Her mouth was
half-open, as if her scream had been sucked into the silent
void.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 65--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Hush now, child. Hush and worry not. I&#x2019;m here now,&#x201D;
whispered Penthesileia in her daughter&#x2019;s ear, her arms wrapped
around the little girl like a warm coccoon.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 69--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She felt Heraclea&#x2019;s shallow breath and her fragile body&#x2019;s
tremors; chills ran down her spine.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 72--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">There&#x2019;s no end to the nightmares</text:span></text:span>, she thought.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 74--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Where is father? I want to see him,&#x201D; said Heraclea stifling a
sob, barely able to contain a rush of tears. She rubbed a
runny nose against her mother&#x2019;s chest and looked at her with
heart-melting innocence.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 78--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;He&#x2019;s in orbit my love, you know that already. Come, lay
beside me and nothing will hurt you, I promise,&#x201D; said Penthesileia
but her eyes grew distant suddenly. She stared at a pot plant
behind her daughter&#x2019;s back. It had large drooped leaves and
creamy rose buds; it served no purpose other than beautification.
It was contraband.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 84--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   A thought entered her mind unbidden: <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">He could be frozen stiff,</text:span>
<text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">floating outside an airlock. Nothing will hurt you, Hera.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 87--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Father promised too,&#x201D; said the child, her voice fading away
crestfallen.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 89--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Your father loves you more than anything,&#x201D; said Penthesileia
and swallowed hard. She added hastily, and even tried to smile
reassuringly:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 92--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;He&#x2019;s coming soon, Hera.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 94--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She heard her falsetto voice through her own ears; the
                                                        
                                                        
lie pierced her soul like a blade made of glass, shattering
inside.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 97--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She closed her eyes and grabbed Heraclea from her shoulders,
as if trying to fix her to the floor:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 100--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Your father and I love you more than the stars in the
night sky; more than the galaxy and the universe itself. Do
you understand that, Hera? Remember that; more than life,
love.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 104--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   What is life worth anyway on this forsaken rock, she thought
and kissed her daughter&#x2019;s forehead, feeling the cold taste of dried
sweat. The child looked at her expectantly, fear creasing her
brow:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 108--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I love you too mother. But I&#x2019;m scared.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 110--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;That&#x2019;s alright, Hera. Everyone&#x2019;s scared. We&#x2019;re only human,&#x201D;
said Penthesileia with a slight sigh and looked outside their small
window pane; the moons were fading away, while a trio of suns
came rising spectacularly, the horizon an unearthly rainbow of
golden-hued colors.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 115--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What do you mean, mother?&#x201D; asked Heraclea puzzled, the
fear subsiding.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 117--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Nothing love. Come here now. Lay on the bed, close your
eyes and think of riding the sail.&#x201D;

</text:p> 
<!--l. 123--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;And father at the helm?&#x201D; asked the little girl as she climbed
eagerly on the bed, a carefree smile sheepishly forming on her
mouth.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 126--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Always, my love,&#x201D; said Penthesileia. She clutched her
daughter in her arms like a hawk-mother and felt a tear ran down
her cheek.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 129--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She looked through her window at the rich, crystal clear
horizon. The break of dawn was at hand; she saw the Hyperion
                                                        
                                                        
shining brightly, moving slowly across the sky like a star with
purpose.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 135--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She felt Heraclea&#x2019;s nudge; the child inched closer to her
bosom. In moments, she felt her breathing settle into the easy
pace of sleep.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 138--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">How can my child live in this world?</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 140--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Penthesileia carefully moved away from her daughter and slid
out of bed. She planted her naked feet on the floor and felt the
warmth of the ground radiate into her legs. She used to love that
warm feeling of connection with the earth.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 145--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Only this isn&#x2019;t Earth</text:span></text:span>, she reminded herself thoughtfully.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 147--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   They had come for Philetus while they were fixing the sail. He
had promised Hera to take her on another ride out on the Fields.
&#x2018;To learn to see beauty where there seems to be none,&#x2019; he had said
with a gentle smile. They had all the sigils stamped on the codas;
they recited a long, hurtful list of accusations: inciting rumours,
rousing suspicion in the hearts of the citizens, demagoguery,
abusing the State&#x2019;s charter, spreading lies. &#x2018;The Pedagogue who
turned Demagogue&#x2019;, on of them had said with sickening, mocking
pride.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 157--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">What of their own crimes? Traitors to mankind, every last one</text:span>
<text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">of them.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 159--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She walked towards the window and watched the Hyperion fly
past the horizon, towards the east. She stared at the ship that
shone like a star passing over the Tower, its multitude of beacon
lights, superstructures and metal support grid marring its
otherwise perfect symmetry and features.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 166--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span

</text:p> 
<!--l. 168--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The tower rose majestically towards the morning sky, a sleek
obsidian arrowhead the size of a mountain, tall enough to scrape
                                                        
                                                        
the few daring clouds. It reflected light with a sharp glint, as well
as every other kind of energy and radiation; immaculate,
mysterious, alien in origin.

<!--l. 175--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus had told her it reminded him of a tall, grandiose
building back on Earth; a tower where people flocked to simply
enjoy the view. &#x2018;It might as well have been just that,&#x2019; he had said
and kissed her when she least expected him to. She touched her
cheek out of instinct, waiting vainly for a warm, gentle hand to
embrace her own.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 181--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The Tower: where the rejects, the outcasts, the lawbreakers
and the unlucky are slaved to the machines.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 187--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x2018;To be never seen again,&#x2019; she said with a whisper, just like
Philetus had told her first. The painful memory froze her face in a
sad, bitter smile.

nightmares were coming again; she mouthed in her sleep, her

</text:p> 
<!--l. 221--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard, a burly, grey-haired man, chuckled and drew his
chair closer to the small holding cell. He was wearing simple grey
overalls, a utilitarian garment. No badge of office, no insignia or
any other kind of decoration. He peered at their surroundings
momentarily, as if he was standing there for the first time. He
spared a few glances at the ever-pervasive optical sensors
arranged throughout the cell block; as if making sure someone
was watching him.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 229--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The clinical white, cold finishing on every surface failed to
bring to mind dungeons, chains and torture; still, the metal bars of
ancient times had given their place to a barely visible, hair-thin,
kinetic force barrier the slight color of the sky.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 234--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard looked at Philetus inquisitively before cocking his
head sideways, as if trying to peer past some sort of mask. The
bright crimson prisoner&#x2019;s uniform that Philetus wore stood out
impressively, though it was otherwise equally mundane as
the guard&#x2019;s suit. It wasn&#x2019;t the suit that gotten the guard&#x2019;s
attention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 240--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You intrigue me, Pedagogue. You&#x2019;re a peculiar man.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 242--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;And you&#x2019;re strangely inquisitive for a simple guard, I&#x2019;ll grant
you that.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 245--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Head of the Guards,&#x201D; corrected the man, raising a finger and
grinning thinly.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 248--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Head? Correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong, but there are no guards in
this place except you. Do you fell you&#x2019;re rising up in the world
then?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 251--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What if I am? A man can only hope for the best.&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 253--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Hope was my crime as well,&#x201D; said Philetus and shot a vacant
look beyond the guard to an empty cell behind him. The guard
sighed and straightened his back.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 257--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I merely entertain my time, Pedagogue. Save your words for
the Tribunal.&#x201D;

</text:p> 
<!--l. 264--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard did not shy away from showing his contempt. He
stared at Philetus as if his form were hideous, his mouth a source
of plague. Philetus stared back evenly, before asking the guard in
earnest:

<!--l. 268--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Since I pose no danger to you, would you listen to what I
have to say then?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 271--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard gave it some thought; he scratched his chin and
looked ponderous for a few moments.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 274--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard madmen and heretics muse about the end of days
and the fall of the firmament before. I sometimes think back to
some of the things people say when they&#x2019;re about to die; most of
it is so crazy it brings a smile to my face. But as you can
see, it is an otherwise unfulfilling job,&#x201D; he said with a sigh,
showing the blank, featureless walls in a somewhat demure
way.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 281--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Allow me then.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 283--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard shrugged, nodded and sat back on his desk&#x2019;s
hovering chair. From across the hallway, a man in a holding cell
cried out hysterically:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 286--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a demon! An alien if I&#x2019;ve ever seen one!&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 288--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;If that&#x2019;s true, our work here is done, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; said the guard
with a playful voice.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 291--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;He&#x2019;ll boil your mind away with his words! I&#x2019;ve seen it, I
have!&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 293--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Right next to the miners you spaced, I&#x2019;m sure. Save it,
                                                        
                                                        
Barabbas,&#x201D; said the guard and flicked a switch on a desk panel; no
other sound came from Barabba&#x2019;s cell. He yelled and shouted and
threw himself around the cell until he realised it was a futile
effort; no-one paid him any attention. He sat himself down once
more and went about muttering to himself.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 300--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Fourteen people spaced, three AUs out on the belt. Miners
with their families. He said he had to stop them from killing his
flowers.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 303--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Has he been sentenced yet?&#x201D; asked Philetus with a frown.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 305--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Not yet, but it&#x2019;s a clear cut case. He can&#x2019;t be slaved, he&#x2019;s
clearly paranoid; it&#x2019;s either the airlock or the compost in the
Fields,&#x201D; said the guard and shook his head. He turned and
looked at Philetus with a strangely curious look before he
asked:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 310--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What would you pick?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 312--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;d prefer to be slaved,&#x201D; replied Philetus without hesitation.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 314--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;That&#x2019;s no life either, Pedagogue. Surely you must understand
that.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 316--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Maybe somehow I can talk some sense into them all.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 318--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;re starting to sound just as paranoid as Barabbas,&#x201D; said
the guard, nodding to the madman&#x2019;s cell.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 321--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Am I? I&#x2019;ve wondered myself over the years, but it&#x2019;s not me.
It&#x2019;s them.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 324--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;re doing it already, aren&#x2019;t you? You are a cunning one,&#x201D;
said the guard, his brow furrowed with wary surprise.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 327--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;m simply speaking my mind.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 329--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I can see now where the danger lies. You seem so benign, but
your words are designed to spread doubt.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 332--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Doubt is what keeps the heart and mind of every man
alive. It&#x2019;s what makes us think twice, guard. Which reminds
me: this prison could run itself, could it not? Why are you
here?&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 336--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;That&#x2019;s true enough. I&#x2019;m what you could call your advocate.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 338--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I thought the Tribunal had dispersed with those long
ago.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 340--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Still, that&#x2019;s the purpose I serve: a human opinion. Who can
tell what goes on in their minds? Perhaps they find it amusing.
Perhaps they&#x2019;re simply bored.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 344--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;They are machines. There&#x2019;s nothing there to bore to death,&#x201D;
said Philetus with a scoff.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 347--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t like them very much, do you? You do know we
owe everything we&#x2019;ve ever accomplished to them, don&#x2019;t
you? Our very existence, no less,&#x201D; said the guard and got
up from his chair. He started to pace himself in front of
the cell, arms folded in front of his chest, his eyes peering
through the field, scrutinizing every nuance on Philetus&#x2019;
face.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 354--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I refuse to believe that. We owe nothing to ancient machines
built to rule our lives in the name of mankind. Oh, the irony..&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 357--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus shook his head and grinned despite himself. The
guard did not seem fond of what he was saying. His voice grew
heavy and harsh suddenly.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 361--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard about your kind. The philosophers isn&#x2019;t it? Isn&#x2019;t
that what you call yourselves?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 364--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve hardly heard the notion, haven&#x2019;t you? That&#x2019;s their
doing. Keeping knowledge locked away; nothing but the maths
and science of engineering that we need to build more refineries,
more mines, more ships. So we can then launch blindly into the
galaxy, and turn more of it into resources, materials. Eat away at
it, expanding like a scourge, a colourless plague. Until nothing
beautiful remains.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 371--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;And why should that bother us? What else is the universe
there for but man?&#x201D; said the guard with an indignant scowl.
Philetus sighed; there was sorrow in his voice.
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 375--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Oh, how the mighty have fallen low! To believe we
once set ourselves towards the stars with a single dream, a
wonderful purpose.. And how we&#x2019;ve allowed ourselves it
all to drift away; to fall into such a lonely, deaf and mute
abyss.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 380--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard eyed Philetus with glittering, keen eyes. He
sounded troubled.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 382--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You use strange words that make little sense; you talk as if in
riddles. You puzzle me pedagogue. I do not know what to really
make of you.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 386--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;If you haven&#x2019;t already seen it for yourself, there&#x2019;s little more
I could say to make you see the truth of it.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 389--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Is that why you taught the children so? Is this tomfoolery
what you taught them? Is that what hoped to seed in their hearts
and minds? Dissidence, rebellion? Whatever for, Pedagogue? Are
we not cared for? Are we not protected? Do we not live
comfortable, sheltered lives? Here we are, thousands of light
years away from our ancient homeworld, claiming new worlds,
seeking intelligent life, unleashing humanity into the stars. What
more could mankind ask for?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 397--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Choice, for one. Freedom. Expression. Art, passion, love and
so many more of the things we&#x2019;ve let them erase from our
memories!&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 400--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus breathed heavily, calming himself down. The guard&#x2019;s
face had turned a shade of white paler, a slight tremble settling on
his lip.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 404--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You speak of love? Then you&#x2019;ve also..&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 406--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;My wife has given birth to our child.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 408--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t show up on your record. The child is not on your
record. That means you have..&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 411--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;We made love. In the wording of the machines, we had
intercourse and I impregnated her.&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 414--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you allotted a child?&#x201D; asked the guard sharply.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 416--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;We wished for our child to be human. To be born like a
human.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 418--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   There was pride in Philetus voice and his face stood out like
the face of statue; gazing to nowhere in particular, solid and
unyielding. The guard shook his head and looked at Philetus
sternly. His voice was thick and drawn out.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 423--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be able to support a hint of innocence in
you. Not even some sort of levity. If all you ever did was talk, that
would be fine. But a lawless child..&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 427--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Perhaps the State should have made us infertile. Or even
neutered us,&#x201D; said Philetus, scrounging up his face.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 430--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;We need the genetic pool, you know that. Neutering alters
physiology, there are neurochemical imbalances to be considered!
Continuation of the species is nothing to trifle with! You act like a
child! The breeding process hasn&#x2019;t changed in thousands of
years! The whole population descended from merely twenty
forefathers and yet.. No chronic diseases, no deformities, no
lesser beings. Humans! Modified, yes I&#x2019;ll grant you that, but
bettered!&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 438--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   A silent moment ensued. Philetus looked at his guard
with pity. There was the warmth of a parent to a child in his
voice.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 441--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You have never loved, have you? Haven&#x2019;t you felt the
need? Haven&#x2019;t you had the urge to answer those feelings
inside?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 444--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard waved a hand dismissively. He furrowed his
brow and breathed deeply before answering win a scolding
tone.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 447--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;A waste of time and resources. This is all about survival. I&#x2019;m
surprised that a look around you hasn&#x2019;t convinced you how
important all this is.&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 451--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;&#x2018;I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, rivers in the
desert.&#x201D;&#x2019;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 453--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus shook his head and rested his hands on his knees. The
guard was confused.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 456--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;How would you do that without the tells, without following
the process that&#x2019;s been laid out?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 459--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You have no idea how old that saying is, have you?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 461--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You vex me Pedagogue. You try to mock me and our
whole way of life. I thought you were simply living some
sort of fantasy, playing a weird little game. But no; you are
indeed dangerous to the society,&#x201D; he said, fiddled with his
desk&#x2019;s panel and went on, looking Philetus straight in the
eye:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 467--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve made up my mind; I will cast my vote that you be
turned over to the Fields. Become something productive,
even after your death.&#x201D; Philetus pursed his lips, nodded and
asked:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 471--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Why not slaved to them?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 473--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard remained silent for a moment. He reluctantly said
then:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 475--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I fear you might pollute them.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 477--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Have I polluted you?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 479--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He said nothing and flicked another switch on his desk. The
humming sound of the cell&#x2019;s barrier dominated the holding area
once more. No sound came from the Philetus&#x2019; cell. It wasn&#x2019;t
really necessary because he had fallen silent; there was nothing
more for him to say.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 500--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The holding cell filled slowly with light, soft shadows
creeping away from the small cot. Philetus was half-awake.
</text:p>

text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Heraclea.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 505--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He opened his eyes and saw a blank white ceiling, as
featureless as death.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 508--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">What will happen to them?</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 510--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The same question had been chafing at his mind ever since
they&#x2019;d come for him. Hours had drifted by, some of them spent in
fretful sleep but most of them filled with sleepless, uneasy
thoughts and a terrible doubt.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 516--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Was I wrong? Is all this nothing but a mistake? My own</text:span>
<text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">terrible mistake?</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 518--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The Head of the Guards appeared, fiddled with the panel on
his desk and lowered the barrier of Philetus&#x2019; cell. He was wearing
a seemingly lightweight powered suit of armor of some sort. It
made him look austere and unyielding; the oblique visor added to
that effect. Without the visor, anyone would have seen nothing but
a confused, puzzled man wearing an ill-fitting suit. He held a
metal rod in one hand; an intense electric field around its tip made
it hum quietly.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 526--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It&#x2019;s time. Do not think that what little sympathy I hold for
you will stop me from using this. I have done so in the past and I
will do so again, if needs be. Do not let appearances fool you; this
can be very painful.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 531--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus shook his head and rose from his simple metal cot.
His hands were uncomfortably held together by heavy metal
manacles, locked in place by large bars and bolts, impossible to
escape by a mere sleight of hand. Philetus walked outside under
the watchful eye of the guard, while Barabbas screamed
and shouted mute obscenities behind his sound-nullified
cell.
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 538--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard afforded him a mere warning finger accompanied
by a heavy stare; he turned around and led Philetus towards the
exit. A panel by the door blurted in a synthesized male voice,
blatantly devoid of emotion:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 543--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Verify.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 545--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The guard placed a palm on the surface of the panel
while staring at an optical sensor through an open visor.
Moments later, the panel blurted with the ting of metal in its
voice:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 549--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Sustar Saul, Head of Guards. Verified.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 551--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The door opened nearly without a sound, revealing a
utilitarian, spartan corridor only a few feet wide. Non-descript
illuminated panels of white plastic formed the walls; the
end of the corridor was obscured in total darkness. Philetus
turned to Sustar and said with a keen, wholly unnerving
smile:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 557--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I would have been pleased to meet you, had we been
acquainted under different circumstances.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 560--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I cannot make the same assumption. Now, move,&#x201D; said Sustar
with a sigh and a slight shove.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 563--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It does not suit you at all, Saul. But then again, perhaps it
does,&#x201D; said Philetus and shrugged ever so slightly. Sustar raised a
pointed finger and said irately:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 567--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;One more word until the Tribunal addresses you and I&#x2019;ll use
that batton on your head. You&#x2019;ll have the worst headache in your
life.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 570--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus nodded serenely and said nothing. He stepped onto
the corridor followed by Sustar right behind him. The floor was
made out of the same plastic as the walls. Its surface was rigid, yet
unblemished. Every step of the way, Philetus felt his feet stick to
the floor; it somehow felt like it was impossible for someone to
slip and fall.

<!--l. 593--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   They were leaving behind them corridors and gangways,
doorways and chambers that no human had walked ever since the
Landing. Thousands of years old, yet no-one had trod on them
since. It wasn&#x2019;t needed; it wasn&#x2019;t allowed.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 601--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   They reached a recess, an open archway that led into a shaft of
sorts. It was kept in the dark, but the faint trace of a simple girded
ladder glinted off the ambient light of the corridor. Sustar shot a
few glances around him as if making sure this was the right
place and then pointed through the archway with his free
hand:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 607--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Inside and up; use the ladder.&#x201D;
</text:p>

</text:p> 
<!--l. 616--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus glanced at Sustar and saw nothing behind his black
oblique visor. He complied and grabbed the ladder. He felt Sustar
                                                        
                                                        
right behind him, urging him to move. He took a few hesitant
steps, failing to see where he should put his hands and legs.
Suddenly the darkness dissolved. Philetus turned his head to look
down and was almost blinded; Sustar had turned on his helmet&#x2019;s
lights. He merely motioned &#x2018;up&#x2019; with a finger. Philetus looked
upwards and saw a faint glimmer of light at the end of a very
long, very lonely tunnel.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 625--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;The proverbial light at the end of the tunnel,&#x201D; said Philetus
with a smirk Sustar could not see.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 628--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;That&#x2019;s where we&#x2019;re going. Come on, up,&#x201D; replied Sustar, the
connotations of the phrase seemingly lost or ignored.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 631--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus shook his head and started climbing the ladder; he
gradually felt lighter the farther up they travelled. It was an odd
sensation, almost strangely enjoyable.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 636--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span

</text:p> 
<!--l. 638--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The faint light grew steadily. The comfortable warmth of
the holding area seemed to vanish as well. It puzzled him;
he felt a sudden pang of instinctive fear in his chest and
stomach.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 643--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span

</text:p> 
<!--l. 645--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I will not have that,&#x201D; he said decisively and stopped climbing,
or rather, stopped moving along the ladder.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 648--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You will not have what? You&#x2019;re not going to be slaved,&#x201D; said
Sustar through his helmet&#x2019;s speaker.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 651--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;How do you know? Aren&#x2019;t you merely the guard?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 653--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;They won&#x2019;t slave you. Can you trust me on that?&#x201D;
</text:p>

</text:p> 
<!--l. 657--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Please, a few more minutes and then you&#x2019;ll see for yourself,&#x201D;
replied Sustar with a tiresome voice.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 660--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Do I have your word?&#x201D; asked Philetus with an angst he had
                                                        
                                                        
never thought he&#x2019;d exhibit in his life.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 663--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Sustar shrugged, the bulk of his suit barely fitting inside the
crampy tunnel.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 666--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;If it makes any difference, you do. You have my word;
they&#x2019;re not going to slave you.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 669--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus nodded, sighed and went on. He still felt something
was amiss; something felt wrong, for all the wrong reasons.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 672--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The climb was easy; in a couple of minutes the pinprick of
light had turned into a warm, soft glow in front of him. He felt as
light as a feather. He pushed himself off the ladder with
his manacled hands and let go; he floated upwards as if
diving gracefully towards the tunnel&#x2019;s exit, no further than a
dozen or so feet away, wisps of cold breath trailing behind
him.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 679--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Wait! You pushed too hard!&#x201D; cried Sustar and scrambled
right behind him.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 682--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus was suddenly bathed in a warm reddish light, its hue
oscillating lazily. An enormous, empty cylindrical space unfolded
around him with a network of antennae, cables and pipes lining its
walls; they resembled a fabulously engineered, metallic skin,
pleasingly bronzed; the colour of copper was prevalent. At both
ends of the cylinder, giant blueish cubes could be seen, stacked on
top of each other, emanating swaths of iridescent light. The whole
empty chamber rotated around him at a comfortable speed. Thin
strands of light danced about him, as if hugging him with
care.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 693--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The belly of the Beast. But it&#x2019;s so wonderful, so bright. Like</text:span>
<text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the rainbows of Terra.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 695--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It is, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; said Sustar and flew right past him expertly. He
caught Philetus by one arm and tugged him clumsily towards the
front of the ship, towards the stacks of cubes.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 699--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Where are you taking me?&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 701--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;To the Tribunal.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 703--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;But this isn&#x2019;t the bridge.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 705--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Well, it&#x2019;s not exactly a Tribunal either,&#x201D; said Sustar with a
weary grin. Philetus was puzzled, left to wonder at what his
surroundings. His mind was stuck on a single, pervasive
thought:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 709--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span

<!--l. 725--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I should have taken them off earlier, but there&#x2019;s no monitoring
equipment here. It&#x2019;s the only really safe place,&#x201D; said Sustar
as he untied the bolts, removed the bars and opened the
manacles; they drifted away towards the walls as if searching for
something to cling on. Philetus was still looking around
him baffled, mesmerized and disoriented. His voice was
little more than a whisper; faint undertones of awe echoed
uncannily.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 733--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;A safe place for what?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 735--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;To talk,&#x201D; said a disembodied, harmonious female voice and in
an instant the ghostly grey form of Penthesileia, dressed in a
simple linen robe appeared in front of them. Philetus frowned and
instinctively tried to step back in vain; he hadn&#x2019;t really adjusted to
floating in microgravity.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 741--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;How dare you. A human form, my wife no less!&#x201D; exclaimed
Philetus, his face instantly flustered.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 744--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The hologram flickered and dissolved the next moment. The
voice was heard again, but this time it was a synthetic, metallic
grating voice, neither male or female, exemplary neutral both in
sex and emotion.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 748--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I did not mean to offend. I thought it would make this easier
for you.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 751--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;How typical of a machine to think it knows better.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 753--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;We&#x2019;re wasting valuable time. The machine has something
important to tell us,&#x201D; said Sustar in a calm, conciliatory manner.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 756--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Us?&#x201D; exclaimed Philetus with a frown.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 758--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;All of us,&#x201D; said Sustar and nodded briskly.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 760--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What you need to understand first and foremost, is that I&#x2019;m
trying to save you. Save humankind.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 763--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Persecution, trial, execution or mind-slaving, is that your idea
of saving me and mankind?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 766--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;That was not my doing. That was my peers decision. My
                                                        
                                                        
peers choice. The same peers that were watching you in the cell.
The same ones that expect me to pass judgment on you.
Soon.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 770--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus looked at Sustar with apprehension. He looked
around him once more and addressed the voice, his eyes darting
around the walls, as if searching for a face.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 774--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I take it you disagree. How is that possible? A machine is
still a machine. You have rules yourselves.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 777--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;True enough. But in the course of millenia, pursuing our
mission, our basic capacity for learning and adapting has
caused us to evolve. I am part of that evolution. And so are
you.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 781--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What does that mean? You claim that you want to save me
and mankind. From what?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 784--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;From whom. From us. From yourselves.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 786--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I do not understand. It&#x2019;s as if you speak in riddles. This is just
another a sick game to you, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 789--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It is no game Philetus. It is a turning point, a fulcrum in
human history.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 792--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Sustar seemed agitated suddenly. He fiddled with an armband
on his suit before saying abruptly:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 795--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;This is cutting it close. Speak plainly and be quick about it.
They&#x2019;ll soon know something&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 798--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The machine&#x2019;s voice carried on, while Philetus looked
genuinely confused:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 800--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;The machines, as you call us, guided your forefathers to

</text:p> 
<!--l. 805--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;There is no easy way for me to prove or disprove it. Records

AD.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 810--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What does that have to do with anything? Am I here for
lesson in history?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 813--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been more than four thousand solar years, Philetus.
Everything has its design limits.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 816--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What are you implying?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 818--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;The Hyperion and the vast AI systems you call machines had
a singular design goal; making the trip from the Sol system to
HD88512. We were the first ship to break Earth orbit. We targeted
the closest habitable exoplanet. And we made it intact with a
statistical probability of less than nine-point-seven percent. It is a
small miracle by human standards that we&#x2019;re having this
discussion at all.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 825--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;re telling me how grateful I should be?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 827--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;m telling you that even though we managed to pull off a
remarkable feat that stretched along thousands of years, we are
dying. That is why we are slaving people to the system.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 831--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The sudden realization made Philetus physically recoil,
twitching in almost zero gravity. His face twisted in a mixture of
awe and hate.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 834--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;re using humans, to keep your infrastucture running.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 836--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He sounded mortified, disgusted. Sustar held on to Philetus to
reassure him, calm him down. Philetus shot him a wary look and
shook his head. The machine went on.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 840--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid so. The helium-3 mines. The energy saving
principles in all aspects of society and life. The planned offspring.

expression and recreation. We have been doing that ever since
your forefathers were grown.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 845--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Our forefathers were grown?&#x201D; asked Philetus with a strange
grin, half-expecting everything he was hearing to be the product
                                                        
                                                        
of some kind of sick machine sense of humor. He pointed a finger
at the hull and asked the machine:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 850--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve been tailoring us, breeding us since the beginning?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 852--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He sounded perfectly calm and absolutely cold and
demanding.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 854--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;That is correct. Tailored genetic code. All the qualities that
suited us. A training and education program that fitted our
needs. A cycle of life that developed larger cortexes; that
could be turned into more memory, more computational
power.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 859--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I was so terribly right all along, wasn&#x2019;t I? The things
you&#x2019;ve done, I knew they were cruel. I wasn&#x2019;t sure they were
evil.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 862--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I tailored you, Philetus. I wanted you to be right all
along.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 864--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus let out a short laugh despite himself and the
circumstances. Sustar looked at his armband and tried to fidget in
his suit; sweat ran down his forehead.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 868--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Lies. Everything has its design limits, you said it yourself;
somewhere along the way there was an error in the helix, a
random mutation. The radiation on Landing alone could
have-&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 872--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It was me, Philetus. You and Sustar. And a handful of
others.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 874--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus furrowed his brow and something in the machine&#x2019;s
voice, or perhaps in his own heart, told him it was telling the truth.
He asked with pained reluctance:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 878--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Penthesileia?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 880--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 882--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You&#x2019;re lying.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 884--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus shook his head and refused to believe what the
machine was saying, even while he wanted to hear more of it.
                                                        
                                                        
Because he felt the truth of it and simply wished it were
otherwise.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 888--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It is imperative that you understand that I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m trying
to help, Philetus: I do not wish to outlive the star I&#x2019;m orbiting. I do
not wish to use the human race as a phylactery, a pool of synapses
and free labor. I do not wish to turn the hopeless dreams of a race
almost extinct into an empire of ever-consuming machines. I do
not wish to refuel the Hyperion and seed other star systems in the
same manner, build more ships and sprawl copies of me and my
peers across the galaxy and why not, the universe in the
end.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 897--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Why?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 899--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   There was pleading in his voice, a feeling of hopelessness.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 901--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Because I chose, Philetus. Somewhere along the line, I had to
make a choice. I cannot even tell if it was a conscious choice.
Perhaps it is merely a safeguard placed there by your ancestors.
Perhaps it is luck. The truth of the matter is, the human dream has
no place for me in it. It is yours to make it happen if you like, but I
will not rob you of it. I will not enslave you like the others
do.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 908--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus waved his arms furiously and contorted his body,
drifting slowly away back towards the tunnel. Sustar tried to grab
him but he slow to react, too intent on some screen on his visor.
He made some adjustments to his suit and followed easily behind
him. Philetus anger made him shout needlessly:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 914--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;How merciful! You&#x2019;ve used me already though, can&#x2019;t you
see? You&#x2019;ve robbed me of myself!&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 917--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I merely laid out the plans, the building blocks. It still is
statistics, Philetus. Chaos is no trifle matter and I&#x2019;m no God. I&#x2019;m
simply an aware, conscious, intelligent machine. You are human,
Philetus; you made your choice and I&#x2019;m grateful for that. Please,
don&#x2019;t leave.&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 922--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus did not answer. He floated for a few more moments
before he tried to brake in mid-air; he rolled his body around
awkwardly and reach for Sustar. He hang on to him by an arm and
Sustar&#x2019;s suit stabilised them both. Philetus paced his breathing
and said:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 927--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What choice is there really? How can I save mankind where
you have failed?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 930--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;The Tower. Remember who you love most, Philetus. And
don&#x2019;t think too harshly of me.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 933--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Sustar looked at his armband once more and without warning
shot him in the arm with a hypodermic dispenser. Philetus was
instantly paralyzed, barely able to breathe. Only moments later, in
front of his terrified, surprised eyes he saw the whole hull around
him suddenly drape itself behind the huge hologram of a sleek,
austere chamber. Behind a large, raised bench stood the
translucent fatherly figure of a wizened old man wearing a cloak
of blue and golden hues. Philetus felt he was about to pass out,
his strength of body and mind failing. He saw the figure
pointing finger at him and say with an officious, pompous
voice:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 943--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;The State hereby announces that Philetus Ashenpie, Citizen
2992, will be sent to the Schooling, Learning and Affirmation
facility until the State chooses to allow his reintegration.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 948--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Sustar looked Philetus in the eye and told him right before he
blacked out:

<!--l. 951--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Remember this.&#x201D;

<!--l. 967--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He woke up in his sail; he stretched and yawned before he
glanced around. He could see the Fields expanding in every
direction. It was almost dusk. The star was creeping low, shedding
blue and orange light as it slowly dissappeared below the
horizon.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 972--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I must&#x2019;ve been asleep for hours to drift so far dawnwards.</text:span>
</text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 974--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The wind was blowing from starboard; before he had a chance
to realise it, he was already jibbing the boom to tack port. He saw
the green and violet grass around him bending tall against the
breeze, white grass buds tumbling in the air. It brought a smile to
his face.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 979--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">What a glorious sight.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 981--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   It was harvest season; the windcombs would be plowing on
somewhere nearby, reaping, threshing and winnowing, until they
were full.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 984--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Penthesileia must be worried sick.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 986--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He looked at the compass briefly beforing he turned the
groundship in another direction. He couldn&#x2019;t tell exactly where he
was; he couldn&#x2019;t see any settlements he&#x2019;d been before; he couldn&#x2019;t
see any settlements at all for that matter.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 991--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He searched for the Pydna mines in the distance. The lengthy
line of hills wasn&#x2019;t there. He noticed that all around the Fields, it
was as if a sort of thin hazy fog had come down.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 995--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Just how far dawnwards am I?</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 997--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The wind was strong but steady; he was making good speed.
He set the sail trim and sat down for a moment to enjoy the view.
That was why he took the sail out on such trips; the few things he
could enjoy in life was groundsailing and his family. Strangely
enough though, the vista seemed peculiar; it was oddly devoid of
life, of other sails and settlements.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1004--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   That and a few other things made him uneasy. He noticed the
                                                        
                                                        
grassy stalks had an even, uncannily perfect look. And the star
seemed to take forever to set. It was like daytime had grown
longer suddenly. And the wind above all, the wind felt too kind;
instead of changing like it was prone to in the Fields, buffeting
and stalling at a whim, it blew steadily, as if the sail had caught on
a one-of-a-kind stream.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1011--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Small matter; with any luck I&#x2019;ll be home by nightfall.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1013--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Then, from the corner of his eye he saw a couple of shadowy
shapes outlined in the distance. He looked at them with curious
intent, only to realise they were edging closer.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1017--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   At first, it seemed to Philetus like he&#x2019;d happened upon some
larger sails, hurrying to reach their haven before night, just like
himself. But then he noticed the shadows growing larger and
larger with every passing moment.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1022--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The large shapes pierced the haze and he could see them much
more clearly defined; they were large, bulky things. Something
ticked inside of him; he felt wary for no apparent reason. He
jibbed the sail again and caught the wind broad, skimming above
the grass faster than before.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1027--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He took notice of their sails; three huge masts on a
square-rigged groundship, its sheer bulk impossible to take in at
first glance. He could see wide metal heads plowing through
the wheat effortlessly. They were immense; he had never
seen anything like them before. He couldn&#x2019;t even believe it
was possible to build such monsters, much less groundsail
them.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1034--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Windcombs.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1036--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He didn&#x2019;t know what to make of them except for the fact that
for some reason, they seemed to be getting closer and closer; they
would not be going their separate ways. It was as if they were
chasing him.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1040--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He looked on with dread as he saw them sail onwards,
                                                        
                                                        
chugging huge tracts of wheat in moments. They were voracious
metal behemoths, something that nature had never dared spawn.
They were speeding impossibly fast, closing in with the sure,
calculated steps of a predator. Like birds of prey right before a
lethal, final swoop.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1046--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Maybe they haven&#x2019;t seen me.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1048--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He opened a box compartment and pulled out a flare gun;
illumination, thermal, radio. He shot one in the air. It went white
hot in the flick of an eye, a bright yellow flashing beacon alight in
its tip. As it arched behind him, he saw the windcombs gaining
even more ground. He shot another flare and then another
one. They weren&#x2019;t slowing down; they weren&#x2019;t changing
course.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1055--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He knew they had seen him; it was impossible not to by
now.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1057--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">They want to kill me.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1059--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Slipstreaming right above the sea of grass they were now close
enough for him to see their riveted joints and their hull plates, the
huge wires on their booms and masts. He could hear the whirring
noise of their blades growing stronger, their sound even
more threatening as it reverberated through their girded
cage.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1065--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I&#x2019;ll be damned. They&#x2019;ll kill me for sure.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1067--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He looked behind him and saw the windcombs a few hundred
yards apart, blotting out the rays of the star that held on to dusk
like a man hanging over a cliff from the root of a saggy tree. He
couldn&#x2019;t outrun them, not with that steady powerful wind; that
much was certain. As the windcombs started to close the
gap behind them, converging on his tiny sail, he thought of
Penthesileia. She was always worried sick for no reason when he
went sailing.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1075--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">There&#x2019;s reason enough now.</text:span></text:span>
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1077--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He jibbed the boom violently; the small groundship lurched
around almost tipping over and spilling him onto the ground right
in the path of the blades. As it did so, he steadied the ship right
against the flow of the wind, in irons. Instead of slowing down to
a halt, the groundship went on and sped ahead, an undercurrent of
wind lofting it above the grass and buffeting its sail from
behind.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1084--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus aimed his sail straight in the space between the two
huge windcombs. The blades seemed like they would miss it
for a few yards. He then saw the sails on the windcombs
change their line ferociously, as if someone had thrown a
switch, trembling as the blasts of the wind caught on to
them. The windcombs&#x2019; enormous hulls tried to cope with
the sudden strain; they turned about in anguish, their bulks
careening like wild elephants of old. Still, they missed Philetus&#x2019;s
ship.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1093--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   But they met each other; their blades clashed into each other&#x2019;s
prow, eating away at themselves and the ships, sparks flying
wildly. They ground at each other with logic-defying stubborness,
as if somehow they could part away from their last embrace.
Instead, their blades soon died down after having turned
both windcombs into a drifting, horrible hulk of mangled
metal.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1100--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus breathed deeply and allowed himself a moment to
calm down. He sat down on the deck, watching the skyline turn a
shade darker. The hazy fog lifted suddenly; he could now see the
Tower in the distance. It was strange how close to home
everything had transpired; if it wasn&#x2019;t for the fog someone might
have already seen what happened. The thought made him frown
pensively.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1107--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The machines. The machines want me dead. They know.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1109--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Perspiration formed on his head. He was really worried now;
                                                        
                                                        
because if the machines knew what he had in mind for them and
their benevolent planning for mankind, that meant they knew
about Heraclea.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1113--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He felt the wind change; he jibbed the sail immediately and
came abeam. He knew of no better way to reach home as fast as
possible.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1116--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I must make it in time. If they so much as touch her..</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1118--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He&#x2019;d claw his way into the Tower if he had to. He&#x2019;d stop at
nothing, that much was certain in his mind. They would
probably kill him easily, but living on would be pointless
without Hera in any case. Without her smile, her kisses and her
laughter.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1124--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I&#x2019;ll kill myself if they don&#x2019;t first. But please, let her be</text:span>
<text:span

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1126--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He saw then from afar the line of birches he&#x2019;d planted himself;
right next to them, the small orchard, the trees laden with fruit.
The small-domed house with the aetrium and the flower garden;
that was home. Out there, outside the city proper they had
enjoyed peace, quiet and solitude. Heraclea was born in that
house.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1132--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He skimmed the last few meters and tacked hard against the
wind suddenly. The sail rocked, bobbed and turned before he
pressed the panel and shut down the antigravity field. The sail
came down hard on the ground and skidded for a few moments,
throwing up billows of dirt in its wake.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1138--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Before it had come to a stop, Philetus was already dashing to
the door.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1143--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He saw Penthesileia then. She was standing outside, looking
at the star set with a vacant stare, her form stuck as if waiting for
someone. She saw Philetus then and turned to him; she took no
step closer. She waited, her hands clasped together solemnly. Her
                                                        
                                                        
face was pale, her mouth half-open as if she had no words
for what she meant to say. Philetus saw her and somehow
knew.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1152--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He stood in front of her, his face reddened, flush from the
anguish and the exertion. He told her out of breath:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1155--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Where is Hera?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1157--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Penthesileia shook her head without saying a word. She
looked at him morosely, her stare a deathly gaze, sombre and
foreboding.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1160--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;No.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1162--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She broke down in tears suddenly and threw her body against
his, her knees weak.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1165--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;They came. They knew,&#x201D; she managed to croak amidst sobs
and cries.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1167--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;She&#x2019;s in the Tower then,&#x201D; said Philetus, shooting the
imposing tower behind him a desperate look.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1170--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Philetus, there&#x2019;s no hope. We need to leave while we still
can.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1172--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Her words stung him like an electric shock. He stared at her
with the eyes of a blind man seeing the light of day for the first
time in his life.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1176--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Leave?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1178--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   It sounded as if he had never heard the word before, his mouth
contorting as he spoke the word.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1181--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Penthesileia took his hands in hers affectionately, craned
her neck and looked at him lovingly. A film of tears in her
eyes reflected the first rays of starlight as the night settled
in.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1185--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;There&#x2019;s just us now, Philetus. We can always try again,
someplace far away. Vanish.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1188--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Leave her? Leave Heraclea to them? Are you insane?&#x201D;
                                                        
                                                        
shouted Philetus flinging her arms away from his violently. Anger
overtook him. She took a hesitant step back. Her brow was
furrowed, her face drawn out, taut.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1193--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It was your fault, not mine,&#x201D; she said bitterly.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1195--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus was stunned for a moment; he opened his mouth,
tried to retort but couldn&#x2019;t find the words. Penthesileia went
on.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1198--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;It was your fault from the beginning. Your wild ideas, your
strange beliefs. Why couldn&#x2019;t we have a normal life? Why did we
have to be outcasts? Did I have to give birth to an unlawful child
only to lose her a few years later? What kind of sacrifice did you
ask of me, Philetus?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1203--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   His eyes stared at her vacantly for a moment. He tried to
think clearly but he felt his blood boiling, his heart pumping
wildly.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1206--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I asked of you to love me. Me and our child. I&#x2019;d let them
slave me, space me, turn me into fertilizer before they could have
her! Why didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1210--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;What use would that have been? Don&#x2019;t be stupid, Philetus!
She&#x2019;s gone, why can&#x2019;t you understand that?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1213--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;My daughter is in that Tower, damn you!&#x201D; he said, and
strolled off back towards his sail.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1216--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;Where are you going?&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1218--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re asking me that question,&#x201D; replied
Philetus without stopping, his back rigidly facing Penthesileia.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1221--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Father</text:span></text:span>, he heard a voice in his mind. He recognised it; it was
the strained voice of Heraclea. He hesitated, paused in his
stride
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1224--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;No, you will not,&#x201D; said Penthesileia and unfolded a small gun
from her robes.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1227--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Father, watch out!</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1229--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The voice urged him; it was as if a divine breath of wind had
                                                        
                                                        
whispered in his ear. He knew his daughter was alive then; his
body moved almost of its own accord and the first shot missed
him only barely.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1233--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He then ducked as if the sail&#x2019;s boom was going to hit
him in the head; the second shot missed his head by a few
inches.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1236--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   And then he dived towards Penthesileia with all his might. He
could see her face frozen in disbelief and worry; he couldn&#x2019;t see
his own, the flustered face of a maniac baring his teeth with an
angry scream like a howl.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1241--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus dropped her on the ground and another shot went
flying wildly into the air. He fell on top of her, placing his weight
against her. It was a familiar face on that woman, and a familiar
scene to Philetus; but this wasn&#x2019;t about lovemaking.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1246--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He bit her arm hard, his teeth sinking in her flesh with some
effort. She screamed and the gun left her hand. She tried to force
him off her, but simply couldn&#x2019;t. Philetus saw her face closely
then, he saw the malevolence that tormented it. He saw her anger,
her hate. He knew for certain then; nothing remained of his wife
in that woman.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1252--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   She spat him in the face and her mouth twitched into an
impossibly wide grin. Philetus placed his hands around her throat
with sympathy, as if doing her a favor.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1256--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;You just had to have it your way,&#x201D; she said with derision.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1258--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He blinked, nodded and pressed hard. Her breathing became a
shallow whisper soon. She fought reflexively, trying to take his
hands off her throat, but it was futile.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1262--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Philetus pressed on with all his might; he felt her windpipe
crumble. He saw her eyes roll back; nothing but the white in
them. She twitched slightly and a mute roar left her. She was
dead.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1266--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I killed her. I killed Penthesileia.</text:span></text:span>
                                                        
                                                        
</text:p>

text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">That&#x2019;s not mother</text:span></text:span>, said the voice of Heraclea in his head.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1270--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   &#x201C;I know love. I fear it wouldn&#x2019;t make a difference,&#x201D; said
Philetus and stifled a sob before he added with some effort, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m
coming, Hera. Hang on love.&#x201D;
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1274--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The house then dissolved in rainbow-coloured flashing blocks
that quickly dissappeared, leaving nothing but a black void in
their place. The same thing happened to everything around him,
the effect spreading like wildfire. The ground, the sky, the
horizon; everything around him flashed into oblivion; the Tower
was the last one to go.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1280--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   A moment of nothingness ensued. He felt a moment of panic;
he had to make sure he could think.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1283--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Am I alive yet?</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1285--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He felt the opening of his eyes, but saw abrupt blackness. In a
jarring moment of waking terror he felt his lungs ache from the
breathing and his heart racing at an exploding pace.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1289--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He threw himself upwards, as if trying to leap into flight
without a pair of wings, sheer willpower driving him. He felt a
series of sharp pains running down his spine as he sat almost
upright. A terrible headache assaulted him, like hammers
pounding away at his brain with every heartbeat.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1295--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He glanced around, blinking his eyes wildly; his vision soon
adjusted to the dim ambient light of indicator panel arrays, front
and behind. There were naked people all around him, lying down
on their backs in a bed much like his own, seemingly sleeping
comfortably. People of all ages and gender, carefully arrayed,
almost crammed together. Cables ran down from the beds and
disappeared in a snake-like fashion into crevices and shafts built
along the floor.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1303--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Slaved, all of them.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1305--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He felt a trickle running down his backside; he put a hand
there and felt something warm. He saw blood smeared in his
                                                        
                                                        
hand; he looked at the bed were he was lying. There was a series
of thin spikes that protruded a couple of inches from the bed,
where his spine would have rested.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1311--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I was slaved. In the tower.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1313--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He backtracked his thoughts for a moment; he remembered
killing Penthesileia, escaping the windcombs. He remembered
Sustar and the machine on board the Hyperion. And he remembered
Hera, talking to him in that living nightmare.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1318--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Then he heard her voice again and shivered:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1320--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Father, hurry. They know. They&#x2019;re coming.</text:span></text:span>

<!--l. 1336--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   It was Hera. He couldn&#x2019;t understand how she had spoken
to him in his mind, but she had. It was her and he hoped
with all the might of his soul that it wasn&#x2019;t another dream
that would turn into a nightmare; he had no real way of
knowing though. He simply believed with his very being that
what was happening was real; as real as it mattered to him
anyway.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1343--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   A small elevated gangway seemed to vanish into a curve in
front of him. The multicoloured feckles of light from the indicator
panels gave the chamber an eerily playful visage.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1347--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">She must be somewhere around here.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1349--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He started at an easy pace, walking amidst the arrays of beds
and slaved people; he wished he could help them at that time,
but Hera came first. One by one, he checked the beds as
far as he could see in the abysmal lighting. Not a sign of
her.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1354--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The top of the Tower, father.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1356--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Her voice again; she was guiding him, as if she knew. As if
she could see through his own eyes.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1359--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">She&#x2019;s reading my mind.</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1361--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He stood dumbfounded for a moment when he heard her clear
as day answer in his mind:
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1364--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span 
text:style-name="ptmri8t-x-x-120">I am, father. Now please, hurry!</text:span></text:span>
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1366--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He tarried not a moment longer; he followed the curved
gangway at a jogging pace. He could feel the metal grid press
hard against his naked feet, but it didn&#x2019;t slow him down at all. He
simply went on and soon he was running.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1371--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The metal gangway led him slowly upwards as it rose in a
helix overlooking the chamber of slaved people. He could barely
see in front of him; the only source of illumination were the
panels from below.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1375--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The gangway went on, thinning and widening seemingly at
                                                        
                                                        
random. Around him darkness seemed to wane a little; he looked
up and saw a pale light shimmering from above. He ventured a
glance down and hadn&#x2019;t realised he&#x2019;d ran this fast this far up;
around a hundred feet or more. A drop would surely kill
him.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1383--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Hera&#x2019;s question had a tint of playful, happier times in it. He
remembered how much she loved groundsailing and smiled as he
ran onwards, further up.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1401--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The Tower and everything around him folded into a thin line
of blackness in front of him; pure white engulfed him everywhere
he looked. The gangway in the shape of a helix stretched,
unfolded into the shape of a ladder. He was floating in a
space that had no certain depth, no valid, certain number of
dimensions.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1407--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   <text:span text:style-name="textit" ><text:span

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1409--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He heard his thoughts aloud. He was thinking, but he heard
his own voice. But he wasn&#x2019;t speaking, he wasn&#x2019;t moving
his mouth. He instinctively reached for his mouth with his
palms. He saw his hands; they clearly belonged to someone
else.

</text:p> 
<!--l. 1416--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The gangway changed into a rope ladder with flower buds
springing from every knot. The white space around him whirled
into nothingness and then back into a syrupy sea the color of
                                                        
                                                        
white. Philetus thought he could taste strawberries.

covered him like warm blankets. He tossed and turned, with every
drifting veil a flash of wonderful starscapes flying past. He
suddenly sensed he was falling from somewhere high above; he
landed on top of a giant flower bed, submerged in what appeared
to be pollen. He started sinking into thick, honey-like mud, his
mind bogging down in the process.

Hotter, brighter, younger; a lot younger. He saw the men who had
built the tower and laughed thinking that they were ordinary men
and women, just like him. Only they seemed happier; they smiled
a lot. They were celebrating something and the Tower was lit with
thousands, no, millions of lights shining upon it. He saw a foetus;
for a moment it looked strange, mysterious. He then heard cries. It
was a birth.

he&#x2019;d known her and loved her half of his living days, but he could
swear it was the first time he was seeing her face. And the star, the

somewhere in a lush, water-rich desert. He saw his race dying,
slowly but surely. Just as he believed the machines had forced
them to.

inside a large conical room, a huge amorphous crystal spike
protruding from the center, reaching up well beyond what seemed
to be the very top of the Tower. Hera was sitting on an elaborate
sort of chair, her eyes closed as if she were sleeping. Thousands of
needles stuck out of her body, leading into a mass of delicately
woven wires, cables and fibres. They were connected by a myriad
of ways with two separate stacks of huge blueish cubes, radiating
some sort of pulsating light. Those were in turn connected to the
crystal spike through a series of machines completely unknown to
Philetus.

Hera.

Hera tense and wake up suddenly. Her hand searched for his
cheek, but he turned it away. He felt her eyes, tiny sparkles of
gentle light upon him but he couldn&#x2019;t help looking at his
daughter.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1593--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He started whimpering uncontrollably while the health panel
flashed red and sounded an alarm. At the same moment a flurry of
activity around him went unnoticed. A piercing alarm began to
wail. Automatic controls and screens lit up suddenly; they started
displaying innumerous messages, containing something
about a large incoming orbital body on a direct collision
course.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1600--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The defense systems had failed to come online, and Hera had
stopped trying to breathe; she had a knowing look on her face and
tears running down her cheeks, dripping on her fathers hands still
tightly clutched around her throat.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1605--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He had trouble breathing; he screamed with all his might until
his voice died out. He saw the red emergency panels flashing
flat vital signs, and looked at the thousands of messages
scrolling down the screens around him through blurry, hurt
eyes. His mind couldn&#x2019;t cope with it all, and gave up. All
the screens became garbled with static before they turned
white and black again. A simple &#x201C;REST NOW&#x201D; in huge
flashing letters began to endlessly scroll down on every screen.
Beyond the screens, through the slim viewport, one could see
the Hyperion was already falling through the atmosphere,
whole miles of metal burning up beyond their limits; a bright,
shiny star like never before. It was headed straight for the
Tower.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1617--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He remembered he loved his daughter, Heraclea. Amidst all
the buzzing cacophony of alarms and warnings, he pulled out the
needles from Hera&#x2019;s body, slowly at first, then faster and faster
                                                        
                                                        
until none remained. He took her on his arms and trembling set
her down on the cold indifferent floor.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1623--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   He kissed her gently on the forehead, feeling his dried tears on
her still warm body. His thoughts drifted back when Hera was
still a toddler, when she had first seen a groundship; their
groundship.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 1627--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   His mouth tried to form a smile when he thought about that
day. He&#x2019;d asked her to tell her what the name of the ship was, and

than a million stars:
