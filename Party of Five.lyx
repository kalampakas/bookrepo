\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was standing at the docks, watching the good ship Autania as it
 gracefully waded through the peaceful water of Hobb's Bay; the wind was
 on her stern, her sails full.
 She was making good speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hope the damn thing sinks and they all drown,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a scowl on her face.
 Behind her, the harbor was settling into its nightly rhythm.
 Rowdy sailors were looking for the next tavern in line to get drunk and
 have a brawl, the traders were finishing up their business with shady-looking
 characters and the fishermen were making ready for the break of dawn and
 the next catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was sitting right beside her on the stony pier, her naked feet dangling
 in the water.
 She asked Parcifal with had a sad look on her face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Does that mean we can't go back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, we can't go back Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a sigh and a shake of her head, her piercing gaze
 stuck somewhere beyond the rosy-red horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with raised eyebrows.
 She noticed Parcifal's strange, angry look and knew it wasn't the right
 thing to do but asked her anyway:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not ever?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head slowly around and gave Lernea a stabbing look before
 answering coldly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not as long as the Jangdrivals are in power and the Unseen Council remains
 in place, not while the Eleven Pillars stand and the Noble Eagles fly above
 the Skarlas, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea put a finger on her lip and with a puzzled frown asked again: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that never, or really just a long time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You vex me, sister.
 Never means never.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, didn't master Sisyphus always say, `never say never'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with a hesitant smile creeping up on her lip.
 Parcifal's visage turned suddenly sorrowful, like a noble, sleek and gray
 statue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Master Sisyphus is dead, Lernea.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That doesn't mean he was wrong, though.
 Never is such a final word, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and stood up on her toes, her hands on her waist.
 She faced her sister with a bright smile full of optimism which she did
 not share.
 In fact, Parcifal's sadness turned into barely suppressed anger at Lernea's
 persistence to face their new reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get it right in that little thick skull of yours, Lernea.
 We, are, never, going, back, to, Nomos.
 Never!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, a lone finger rapping at Lernea's breastplate with an audible
 clang on the beat of every word.
 Lernea's eyes wandered to her chest for a moment, before her face reddened
 and her breathing became more pronounced, her nostrils flaring up.
 She pouted her lips and said icily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I think I'll just do what I please from now on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal.
 Her face had the look of a poised hawk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate it when you do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea in the same vein, shaking her head slowly with mounting irritation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know, that's why I do it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're such a child.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Says the one who can't accept defeat!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's loud tone made a few heads turn and look.
 Lernea did not even notice they were attracting the attention of the locals,
 and added her own shouts to the rising din of their heated debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This isn't about winning or losing, by Skrala! You can't be that daft!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're the one that got us into this mess in the first place, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with arms crossed on her chest.
 Lernea flailed her arms wildly around her while moving about nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, really now that's just so typical, trying to put the blame on me like
 we're still meddling with the master's spellbook!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well I'm not the one who married Therion Jangdrival on a whim and got us
 exiled!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Parcifal with open arms and a mocking smile.
 Lernea's reply was filled with overtones of shock and disgust, her face
 scrounged up, her revulsion showing in every word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was him or Gheighran! Have you even seen Gheighran? He's a walking swamp-thin
g, not a man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal shook her head and berated her slightly older sister, her face
 suddenly grim and her voice low-keyed and even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that how you make decisions about your kingdom, my Queen? Based on looks
 and appearances? Only if mother were alive..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let her voice trail off and ventured a look towards the ocean.
 The Autania's sail was barely visible, the light of day growing dimmer
 with every passing minute.
 Lernea was looking at her feet, feeling scolded and reprimanded like a
 child.
 Yet, when she talked next she had the voice of a proud woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mother made mistakes as well in her reign.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, she did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal nodding and went on to shout, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She gave birth to you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're only a minute apart, you stupid-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stopped in mid-sentence even as her mouth began to form the word
 `cow'.
 She had instinctively flung her arm and was grabbing at what seemed to
 be a child's arm, the arm extending into a hand holding her coinpurse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and turned to look almost right behind her.
 There was a short person standing there, all dressed up in dark leather
 and an impossibly blant, expressionless face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal took out a silver, teardrop-shaped knife and took a step towards
 her sister's side where the form of a short person stood frozen, said person
 pretending he was nothing more than a misplaced piece of furniture.
 He seemed to be holding his breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A thieving scum, and a bad one at that, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the short person with a whizz.
 Out of breath, he looked sideways at the bristling knifepoint and suddenly
 sucked on air through his nostrils loudly.
 His body relaxed and he let the bulging coinpurse drop to the wooden pier
 with a heavy jingle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea made a grimace and turned her head away from the short man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see why you held that breath of yours.
 Could even kill a man; one of your stature, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed less inclined to comment on the aspiring thief's lack of
 mouth hygiene.
 She looked at him with mixed feelings of curiousity and frustration, brandishin
g her knife with accusation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barely stepped foot on this land, and here's our greeting.
 Couldn't resist our riches, little man?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal, her shiny breastplate protruding from the rest of her body
 armor very close to the thie'f face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be fair, my fair lady! Wasn't ogling your, ehm, lady parts or anything,
 your gracefulness.
 Not that they're not worth to, well, ogle,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with an awkward smile and looked up to Parcifal like a man seeking
 redemption in prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea punched him in the gut then; the short little man doubled over, his
 face flustered.
 He looked momentously suprised and awestruck, rather than simply hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She was talking about our money, our armor, our valuables! Really, to address
 any woman in such a fashion.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned and looked at her sister with a bewildered expression, squinting
 her eyes slightly, her knife still aimed at the thief's general direction
 who was trying to stand up again to his full four feet of height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all about being a queen proper, isn't it? He was addressing me, not
 you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea grinned and straightened her hair before she mused mostly to herself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You really can't get over the fact I was the first born, rightful heir to
 the throne and all that, can you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fact is you're a spoiled brat if I've ever se-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal left her sentence incomplete as she noticed the coinpurse, as well
 as the thief had simply vanished out of sight.
 She looked at the milling crowd behind them reflexively.
 In the dimming, scarce light of dusk she spotted the thief, idly walking
 about with his hands in his pockets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She ran after him with Lernea right behind.
 With little effort she nudged her way past a couple of bystanders who were
 having a smoke and grabbed the man by his cloak, lifting him up like a
 runaway child and handing him over to Lernea.
 She grabbed him with bith hands from his vest's collar.
 The sisters looked positively miffed, if not thunderous.
 The short little man exploded with indignation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do say! What manner of outrage is this now? Bellicose women running rampant
 in the streets? Is there no law, no order in this cauldron of misery and
 debauchery? Guards! Guards!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters looked at the man intently for a moment, examining him like
 some sort of exotic bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and Lernea nodded her affirmation, adding, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no mistaking that breath.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man looked at each of them with an hurtful, presumptious look and raised
 a hand before speaking, his eyes closed most of the time in a haughty manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can dispense with the insult to my dwarven heritage concerning my breath
 since as a gentleman I am aware that great allowances should be made for
 differences of custom and training.
 I can understand you are foreigners, fresh off the boat, clearly confused
 and utterly misguided as to the identity of my person.
 Although you are clear lacking proper lady-like training and manners, such
 is my gentleness and strength of character though that I am willing to
 forego any and all legal accusations and forthcoming tribulations against
 your persons, should you deposit me safely and unharmed on the ground so
 I may go about my business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head and looked at Lernea with a raised eyebrow.
 Lernea looked at her sister and nodded before upending the short man who
 claimed to be a dwarf and shaking him vigorously.
 Other than a couple of bored, curious looks, noone seemed particularly
 inclined to question what has happening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments later a rush of metallic clang was heard as various items
 fell on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aha!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea gleefully, while her sister shook her head with an uncertain
 look on her face.
 The short little man who claimed to be a dwarf and a gentleman was looking
 at the two ladies in an austere manner, even though he was hanging upside
 down, his hands crossed on his chest like some sort of human-like bat having
 a difficult time sleeping.
 His cloak brushed against the items that had fallen from his person; a
 small metallic disc with a chain, a gold, flat square tin like a cigar
 holder, and a small, thin, stiletto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal pouted her lips and made a rolling motion with her hands to Lernea,
 which went largely unnoticed.
 Lernea said with a wide grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What say you now, thief?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She made sure to intone the word thief as it meant someone oozing gritty,
 unhealthy amounts of slime from every orifice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal bulged her eyes and made frantic motions to Lernea to put the man
 down, pointing to what had fallen on the ground instead of the expected
 loot.
 Lernea finally took a look on her own and hesitantly put the short man
 on his own two feet.
 He looked at them with a most severe look that implied he could not find
 the words to begin to describe his feelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I cannot find the words to even begin to describe my feelings.
 You should be ashamed.
 I fear, I cannot in right conscience call you ladies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, dusted off his cloak, straightened his vest and pants and walked
 away briskly without another word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at him in mute disbelief, while Lernea picked up the man's
 items from the ground, spending a mere moment to examine them.
 His small figure had almost disappeared into the mass of people crowding
 the busy street when she shouted at him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir! Terribly sorry, but you forgot your things, sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal had a moment of clarity and sprang into action, running through
 the street shouting to her sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's because those aren't his either!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood motionless for moment, idly holding the stolen goods with both
 hands in her lap.
 Her lips formed a soundless circle while her eyes shone with a dazzled
 ferocity.
 Realizing they had been duped she dropped everything and ran after her
 sister and the dwarf - or perhaps a simply very short man - who kept surprising
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man shot a glance behind his back and saw the sisters were right on
 his tail, shoving and brushing people aside as they ran after him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fire! Fire! I say, fire!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted amidst the crowds in an effort to cause panic and hysteria that
 would suit his purpose of getting away.
 That did not work; the people all around him went about their business,
 a few casually wondering to themselves where the voice came from.
 He had to make himself scarce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Quick! Into that establishment!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled Parcifal to Lernea, her finger pointing to a large sign, graced
 by the presence of nearby lamplight.
 Night proper had fallen and the light posts were being lit up, one by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Sniggering Pig? That sounds like a piss-hole!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did you expect? Come on, hurry!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal even as they left the stream of people in the street and
 saw the man who had robbed them of money and pride hustle past the tavern's
 doorway.
 Sounds of drunken merryment and folk music blasted away from the relatively
 large place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skarla, of all the places..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea mostly to herself but followed Parcifal inside being careful
 not to touch anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the Sniggering Pig, there was ample candle light from chandeliers
 on the high ceiling, as well as candles and lamps on each and every table
 where people had still not passed out.
 A heavy scent dominated the air; rye, ale and roasted meat.
 The tables were mostly full of rowdy gangs of sailors, and everyone seemed
 to be having fun when the music suddenly stopped.
 The hubbub of laughter and loud conversation filled the emptiness until
 a rather tall and lanky fellow appeared at the far end of tavern, on what
 seemed to be the stage where the band of musicians sat.
 Parcifal's eyes had the chance to search the room for a moment.
 There was no sign of the thief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blasted runt of a man,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal, this time gripping her sword's handle instead of her knife.
 Lernea corrected her with a face that implied every second in there was
 making her feel shamefully unclean: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dwarf.
 He said he was a dwarf.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as if on cue, the tall lank man who had appeared on stage cleared his
 throat loudly and bowed, only to receive a handful of drunken 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Show us yer tittays!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless he smiled professionally and went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, this place is lively, ain't it? Feels like a band of roaming Dwarves
 would love to come by.
 Hell, it's not like they're set in stone or anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, grinning widely, posing towards the crowd which hardly noticed
 anyone was talking on stage.
 The performer was having a tough crowd.
 He turned to the band and said in voice right above a whisper: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Guys..
 That was a joke,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to which the percussionist nodded with surprise and promptly made a half-hearte
d drum roll and hit a small bell.
 The sound was more like coconuts banging together.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the performer on stage, clapping his hands all by himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal, equally oblivious to the bad comedian noticed something else and
 told Lernea:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Windows just on the front.
 That door behind the barkeep is locked and barred.
 He's somewhere in here.
 He's trapped!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And us along with him.
 God, is that man heaving his insides?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea with a tremor of disgust in her voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He'll mop it up later, I'm sure.
 Just stay right here on the door.
 I'll flush him out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea let out a little laugh, more aptly like a snigger and put a hand
 to her mouth.
 Parcifal eyed her in puzzlement, her brow furrowed.
 Lernea replied with a giggly voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounded like an, uhm..
 Poop joke.
 'Flush' him out like the little, uhm, shit he is!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal closed her eyes, said nothing and sighed.
 Then she slowly started wading through the tables and the passed-out customers.
 The comedian was trying another joke, while the crowd had mysteriously
 quietened down.
 Lots of sets of eyes were now following Parcifal's slender form as she
 moved about the tavern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dwarves, eh? I remember one night, a group of them fellows walks in this
 very same place.
 One of them yells, 'Barkeep! Seven short ones', to which the barkeep replied,
 'I can see, but what can I get you?'
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The drum roll came on cue, but the laughter he was expecting was delayed
 until a man who had been standing on all fours yelled, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barkeep! Ha ha ha! I gets it! Bar-keep!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spontaneously, half the tavern erupted in fits of laughter, while the other
 half had been magnetised by Parcifal's presence.
 Even if staring at her meant her replying with a stare that could shrivel
 their scrotum and turn their eyes into tiny glass beads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lovely crowd here tonight, lovely crowd.
 Say, I can see lots of sailors, again, nice to have you ashore.

There was no drum roll.
 The man on stage eyed the band and waved his hands.
 The drum roll and the bell finally came but the crowd went on drinking

 Parcifal turned her head around and saw him, pointing an accusing finger

 heavy blade threateningly towards the thief:

Balls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 they said in one voice and everyone suddenly had something that could kill,
 maim, or hurt like hell in hand, most prominently forks, knives and assorted
 cutlery.
 Parcifal stood in the midst of them all, perhaps fifty or sixty men the
 lot of them, half of them still conscious.
 She gave Lernea a look of determined despair and grasped her sword with
 both hands, ready for what seemed to be a sudden, uneven fight to the death.
 Lernea nodded to her sister without a word and loaded her bow with an arrow.
 In one fluid motion, she was already aiming at the thief's head from a
 very comfortable distance; she couldn't miss.

The crowd erupted in sudden cheers and howls, while there still was a man
 who yelled `Balls!' right before slumping down on the floor.
 The comedian got off the stage, disheartened, and headed for the bar while
 the band began to play a serene, lute ballad.
 The barkeep smiled congenially to the comedian and said,

Parcifal and Lernea were standing amidst the merry crowd with their weapons
 at the ready, but it was evident in the way their faces were cringing that
 they were relieved, confused and mildly insulted at the same time.
 Parcifal would not leave the thief from her sight, who approached her with
 hands up in the air, making sure his palms were open.
 He was smiling thinly, looking at Encelados with a keen, respectful eye.
\end_layout

Lernea lowered her bow and strung it behind her back.
 She walked over to her sister, being very careful not to tread on someone

 Lernea stood by her sister's side and lowered her sword before she said

Parcifal couldn't believe her ears, but followed along as if in somekind

 Winceham led the way and drew their chairs, and as they sat down he made
 a motion with a hand to the bar, always smiling.
 Parcifal said as if still in a dream:

 Winceham grinned and laid back on his chair before he said:

 Parcifal added after another swig of ale:

You know that, didn't you? You saw us get off the boat, saw we smelled money

The door to the Sniggering Inn swung with an eerie creaking noise, unusually

 eye.

 he yelled and a vile green slime on the floor.
 Beside him stood a tall, ape-like creature dressed mostly in rugs and cloth,
 all muscle and hair.
 It carried a blunderbuss as tall as a man and grinned widely, its mouth
 filled with golden teeth.
 Like a silent church bell had rung, everyone promptly picked up their hats
 and passed-out companions and left in a hurry, though the last man was
 mindful to enough to close the door behind him.
 Winceham reached and touched the sisters hands awkwardly; he had a desperate
 look on his face.

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged troubled looks.
 They shot glances at the man who had practically ordered everyone to leave

 There was fear, worry and anxiety written there, the sisters shared their
 lack of doubt with a simple nod.
 Ned appeared from behind the bar, holding the sisters' coinpurse, still

 His father, the barkeep, looked at the bossy man with restrained anger.

Winceham rolled his eyes wildly as a signal to the sisters.
 It went largely unnoticed since they had both turned to face what appeared
