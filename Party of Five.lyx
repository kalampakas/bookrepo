Foreword from the author

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
I couldn't really find a working subtitle for this first book in what's
 to become a series.
 Arguably, it's not a book per se (meaning not a full length novel), but
 a book it is still.

Party of Five
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 starts off with this book here, and I envision it as a series of novellas
 that I want to keep writing, evolving the characters and the world as I
 go.
 I could do that it in a full length novel, but it's much easier for me
 to write smaller, self-contained adventures that are linked together through
 the same characters, being fresh and different each time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
Plus, I think a series of novellas can reach an audience faster and it easier
 and more practical (hopefully more fun) to read for most people.
 It is also my opinion that the novella as a genre, needs some more love
 from authors and readers alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
I dearly hope you'll come to like the characters enough to wait for the
 next novella in the series.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The universe, children, is a vast, gloriously beautiful thing that is mostly
 uncaring.
 It's up to us, me, and you, and the common folk as well, to breath a sense
 of justice into it; a balance between right and wrong.
 Careful not to overdo it though, cause it could tip over your heads when
 you least expect it to.
 Like an oxcart full of manure.

\begin_layout Chapter*
Part One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was standing on the docks, watching the good ship Autania as it
 gracefully waded through the peaceful waters of Hobb's Bay; the wind was
 at her stern, her sails full.
 She was making good speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hope the damn thing sinks and they all drown,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a deep scowl on her proud face.
 Behind her, the small harbor was settling into its nightly rhythm.
 Rowdy sailors were looking for the next tavern in line to get drunk and
 have a brawl, the traders were finishing up their business with shady-looking
 characters and the fishermen were readying their nets for the break of
 dawn and their next catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was sitting right beside her on the stony pier, her naked feet dangling
 in the water.
 She asked Parcifal with a look of tempered sadness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does that mean we can't go back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, we can't go back Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a sigh and a shook her head.
 Her piercing hazel eyes were stuck gazing somewhere beyond the rosy-red
 horizon, fiddling with her cropped red hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with understanding and raised an eyebrow.
 She noticed Parcifal had an angry, bothersome look about her and knew her
 timing was off.
 But she had to ask her anyway:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not ever?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head slowly around and stabbed Lernea with a fierce
 look before answering coldly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not as long as the Jangdrivals are in power and the Unseen Council remains
 in place, not while the Eleven Pillars stand and the Noble Eagles fly above
 the Skarlas, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Her tone was harsh, unerringly final.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea put a finger on her lip and spent a few moments playing with a lock
 of her long, brown hair.
 She then frowned from frustration and asked her sister once more: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that never ever, or really just a long time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You vex me, sister.
 Never means never,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal dryly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, didn't master Sisyphus always say, `never say never'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with a hesitant smile creeping up on her lip.
 Parcifal's visage turned suddenly sorrowful, like a noble, sleek and gray
 statue in the palace grounds they would never see again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Master Sisyphus is dead, Lernea.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That doesn't mean he was wrong, though.
 Never is such a final word, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 retorted Lernea and stood upright on her toes, with hands on her waist.
 She faced her sister with a bright smile full of optimism which Parcifal
 clearly did not share.
 Her sister's attitude made Parcifal's sadness turn into barely suppressed
 anger at Lernea's persistence to face their new reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get it right in that little thick skull of yours, Lernea.
 We are, never, going, back, to, Nomos.
 Never!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, a lone finger rapping at Lernea's breastplate with a clanging
 sound after every word.
 Lernea's eyes wandered to her chest for a moment, before her face reddened
 and her breathing became more pronounced.
 Her nostrils flared up and she turned her gaze at her sister.
 She pouted her lips and said icily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I think I'll just do what I please from now on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal; her face had the look of a poised hawk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate it when you do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea in the same vein, shaking her head slowly with mounting irritation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know, that's why I do it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're such a child,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with disdain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Says the one who can't accept defeat!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's loud tone made a few heads turn and look.
 Lernea did not even notice they were attracting the attention of the locals,
 and added her own shouts to the rising din of their heated debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This isn't about winning or losing, by Skrala! You can't be that daft!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're the one that got us into this mess in the first place, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with arms crossed on her chest.
 Lernea flailed her arms wildly around her while moving about nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, really now that's just so typical, trying to put the blame on me like
 we're still meddling with the master's spellbook!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I'm not the one who married Therion Jangdrival on a whim and got us
 exiled!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Parcifal with wide open arms and a mocking smile.
 Lernea's reply was filled with overtones of shock and disgust, her face
 screwed up, her revulsion evident in every word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was him or Gheighran! Have you even seen Gheighran? He's a walking swamp-thin
g, not a man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal shook her head and berated her slightly older sister, her face
 suddenly grim and her voice low-keyed and even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that how you make decisions about your kingdom, my Queen? Based on looks
 and appearances? Only if mother were alive..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let her voice trail off and ventured a look towards the ocean.
 The Autania's sail was barely visible, the light of day growing dimmer
 with every passing minute.
 Lernea was looking at her feet, feeling scolded and reprimanded like a
 child.
 Yet, when she talked next she had the voice of a proud woman:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mother made mistakes as well in her reign.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, she did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal nodding and went on to shout, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She gave birth to you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're only a minute apart, you stupid-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stopped in mid-sentence even as her mouth began to form the word
 `cow'.
 She had instinctively flung her arm and was grabbing at what seemed to
 be a child's arm attached to a hand holding her coinpurse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and turned to look nearly right behind her.
 There was a short person standing there, all dressed up in dark leather
 and an impossibly bland, expressionless face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal grabbed a silver, teardrop-shaped knife from her waistband and
 took a step towards her sister's side where the short person stood frozen,
 said person pretending he was nothing more than a misplaced piece of furniture.
 He seemed to be holding his breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A thieving scum, and a bad one at that, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the short person with a whiz.
 Out of breath, he looked sideways at the bristling knife-point and suddenly
 sucked on air through his nostrils loudly.
 His body relaxed and he let the bulging coinpurse drop to the wooden pier
 with a heavy jingle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea made a grimace and turned her head away from the short man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see why you held that breath of yours.
 Could even kill a man; one of your stature, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed less inclined to comment on the aspiring thief's lack of
 mouth hygiene.
 She looked at him with mixed feelings of curiosity and frustration, brandishing
 her knife accusingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barely stepped foot on this land, and here's our greeting.
 Couldn't resist our riches, little man?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal, her shiny breastplate protruding from the rest of her body
 armor straight at the thief's face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be fair, my fair lady! Wasn't ogling your, ehm, lady parts or anything,
 your gracefulness.
 Not that they're not worth to, well, ogle,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with an awkward smile and looked up to Parcifal like a man seeking
 redemption in prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea punched him in the gut without warning; the short little man doubled
 over, his face flustered.
 He looked momentously surprised and awestruck, rather than simply hurt;
 he seemed to have some trouble breathing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She was talking about our money, our armor, our valuables! Really, to address
 any woman in such a fashion.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned and looked at her sister with a bewildered expression, squinting
 her eyes slightly, her knife still aimed at the thief's general direction
 who was trying to stand up again to his full four feet of height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all about being a queen proper, isn't it? He was addressing me, not
 you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea grinned and straightened her hair before she mused mostly to herself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You really can't get over the fact I am the firstborn, rightful heir to
 the throne and all that, can you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fact is, you're a spoiled brat if I've ever se-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal left her sentence incomplete as she noticed the coinpurse, as well
 as the thief, had simply vanished out of sight.
 She looked at the milling crowd behind them reflexively.
 In the scarce light of the setting sun she spotted the rather short leather-cla
d thief, idly walking about with his hands in his pockets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She ran after him while Lernea hurriedly put on her boots and followed close
 behind.
 With little effort she nudged her way past a couple of bystanders who were
 idly having a smoke and grabbed the man by his cloak.
 She lifted him up like a runaway child and handed him over to Lernea, who
 grabbed him with both hands from his vest's collar.
 The sisters sported positively miffed, if not thunderous, looks.
 The short little man exploded with furious indignation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do say! What manner of outrage is this now? Bellicose women running rampant
 in the streets? Is there no law, no order in this cauldron of misery and
 debauchery? Guards! Guards!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters looked at the man intently for a moment, examining him like
 some sort of exotic bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and Lernea nodded affirmatively and added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no mistaking that breath.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man looked at each of them with a deeply hurt, vastly presumptuous look
 and raised a hand before speaking.
 His eyes remained closed haughtily for the better part of his little speech:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can dispense with the insult to my dwarven heritage concerning my breath
 since as a gentleman, I am aware that great allowances should be made for
 differences of custom and training.
 I can understand from your appearance you are foreigners, probably fresh
 off the boat, clearly confused and utterly misguided as to the identity
 of my person.
 Although you are clearly lacking in proper lady-like training and manners,
 such is my gentleness and strength of character, that I am willing to forgo
 any and all legal accusations and forthcoming tribulations against your
 persons, should you deposit me safely and unharmed on the ground so I may
 go about my business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head and looked at Lernea with a raised eyebrow.
 Lernea shot back her sister a familiar look and nodded, before upending
 the short man who claimed to be a dwarf.
 She then proceeded to hold him by his legs and shake him vigorously.
 Other than a couple of bored, curious looks, no-one seemed particularly
 inclined to question what has happening.
 In Hobb's Bay, anything less than a stabbing wasn't a matter of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments later a rush of metallic clangs was heard as various items
 fell on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aha!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea gleefully, while her sister shook her head with an uncertain
 look on her face.
 The short little man who claimed to be a dwarf and a gentleman no less
 was looking at the two ladies sternly, his short grey ponytail swinging
 as he lay hanging upside down, his hands crossed on his chest like some
 sort of human-like bat having a difficult time sleeping.
 His cloak brushed against the items that had fallen from his person; a
 small metallic disc with a chain, a gold, flat square tin like a cigar
 holder, and a small, thin stiletto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal pouted her lips and made a rolling motion with her hands to Lernea,
 which went largely unnoticed.
 Lernea said with a wide grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What say you now, thief?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She made sure to intone the word 
\shape italic
thief
\shape default
 as it meant someone oozing gritty, unhealthy amounts of slime from every
 available orifice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal bulged her eyes and made frantic motions to Lernea to put the man
 down, pointing to the unfamiliar items that had fallen on the ground instead
 of the expected loot, their property.
 Lernea finally took a look on her own and hesitantly put the short man
 back on his own two feet.
 He looked at them with a most severe look that implied he could not find
 the words to begin to describe his feelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I cannot find the words to even begin to describe my feelings,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a face torn from disgust and disdain.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should be ashamed.
 I fear, I cannot in right conscience call you ladies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, dusted off his cloak, straightened his vest and pants and walked
 away briskly without another word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at him in mute disbelief, while Lernea picked up the man's
 items from the ground, spending a mere moment to examine them.
 His small figure had almost disappeared into the mass of people crowding
 the busy street when she shouted at him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir! Terribly sorry, but you forgot your articles, sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at the various stuff the man had left behind and had a moment
 of clarity; she sprang into action, and started running through the street
 shouting to her sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's because those aren't his either!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood motionless for moment, idly holding the stolen goods with both
 hands in her lap.
 Her lips formed a soundless circle while her eyes shone with dazzling ferocity.
 Realizing they had been duped, she dropped everything and ran after her
 sister and the dwarf - or perhaps a simply very short man - who kept surprising
 them with his sly ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man shot a glance behind his back and saw the sisters were right on
 his tail, shoving and brushing people aside as they ran after him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fire! Fire! I say, fire!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted amidst the crowd in an effort to cause a little bit of hysterical
 panic to make his escape all that easier.
 That didn't work though; the people around him went about their business,
 a few casually wondering to themselves whether or not they had heard some
 kind of voice; those who did hear wondered where it came from.
 He had to make himself scarce the hard way, and bolted into the nearest
 building.

 doorway.
 Sounds of drunken merriment and folk music blasted away from the relatively
 large inn.

Inside the Sniggering Pig, there was ample candle light from chandeliers
 on the high ceiling, as well as candles and lamps on each and every table
 where people had still not passed out.
 A powerful mix of heavy scents dominated the air; rye, ale and roasted
 meat.
 The tables were mostly occupied by rowdy gangs of shady-looking sailors;
 everyone seemed to be having fun judging by the spillage on the floor,
 when the music suddenly stopped.
 The hubbub of laughter and loud conversation filled the emptiness until
 a rather tall and lanky fellow appeared at the far end of tavern, on what
 seemed to be the stage where the band of musicians sat.
 Parcifal's eyes had the chance to search the room for a moment.
 There was no sign of the thief.

Dwarf.

\begin_layout Standard
As if on cue, the tall lank man who had appeared on stage cleared his throat
 loudly and bowed, only to receive a handful of drunken irrelevant yells,
 most prominently, `Show us yer tittays!'.
 Nevertheless, he smiled courteously and said to the crowd:

Well, this place is lively, ain't it? Feels like a band of roaming Dwarves

 Hell, it's not like they're set in stone or anything,

 he said, grinning widely and posing to the crowd which hardly noticed anyone
 was talking on stage.
 The performer was facing a tough crowd.
 He turned to the band of musicians and said in voice right above a whisper:

 The sound was not unlike a couple of coconuts banging together.

 something else.
 She told Lernea:

Lernea let out a little laugh, more aptly a snigger, and put a hand to her

 Parcifal eyed her in puzzlement, her brow furrowed.
 Lernea replied with a giggly voice:

Parcifal closed her eyes, said nothing and sighed.
 Then she slowly started wading through the tables, filled with passed-out

 The comedian was having a go at another joke, while the crowd had mysteriously
 quietened down.
 Lots of sets of eyes were now following Parcifal's slender form as she
 moved about the tavern.

The drum roll came on cue, but the laughter he was expecting was delayed

Barkeep! Ha ha ha! I gets it! Bar-keep!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spontaneously, half the tavern erupted in fits of laughter, while the other
 half lay motionless except for their eyes, magnetized by Parcifal's presence.
 Even if staring at her meant her staring back at them with a look that
 could shrivel their scrotum and turn their eyes into tiny glass beads.
 The comedian went on:

Lovely crowd here tonight, lovely crowd.

\begin_layout Standard
There was no drum roll.
 The man on stage eyed the band and waved his hands.
 Then came a drum roll and the signature cowbell.
 The crowd though wasn't paying attention; they kept drinking and singing
 rowdy songs, mostly containing obscene lyrics about unicorns and the priest's
 daughter.
 There was a voice of dissent though that rose sharply above the cacophony:

\begin_layout Standard
It was the thief, all flustered, standing up on his toes to make himself
 heard.
 Parcifal turned her head around and saw him, pointing an accusing finger
 at the man on stage.
 She drew her sword and shouted above the din of the crowd, cradling the
 heavy blade threateningly towards the thief:

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly the crowd stopped everything they had been doing; the singing ceased
 to be.
 The band on the other hand, much to the comedian's dismay, started to play
 a suspenseful tune.
 The sound of whistling pipes was dominant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Every other night, no-one reads the sign,

 He did try to get everyone's attention though:

Excuse me now, I'm sure there's been some kind of misunderstanding.

Balls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 they said in one voice and everyone was suddenly holding something that
 could kill, maim, or hurt like hell, most prominently forks, knives and
 the odd cutlass and pistol.
 Parcifal stood in the midst of them all, perhaps fifty or sixty men the
 lot of them, half of them still conscious.
 She gave Lernea a look of determined despair and grasped her sword with
 both hands, ready for what seemed to be a sudden, uneven fight to the death.
 Lernea nodded to her sister without a word and loaded her bow with an arrow.
 In one fluid motion, she was already aiming at the thief's head from a
 very comfortable distance; she couldn't miss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thief looked at her, grinned, bowed slightly and yelled:

Jambalaya everyone! I'm buying!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd erupted in sudden cheers and howls, while someone yelled `Balls!'
 right before slumping down on the floor.
 The comedian got off the stage disheartened and headed for the bar.
 The band picked up a serene ballad that no-one really cared for.
 The barkeep smiled congenially to the comedian and told him: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal and Lernea were standing amidst the merry crowd with their weapons
 at the ready, but it was evident in the way their faces were screwed up
 that they felt relieved, confused and mildly insulted at the same time.
 Parcifal would not leave the thief from her sight; he approached her with
 both hands in the air, making sure his palms were open.
 He was smiling thinly, looking at Encelados with a keen, respectful eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea lowered her bow and strung it behind her back.
 She walked over to her sister, being very careful not to tread on someone
 or someone's heaved insides, spilled beer and other assorted spots of trouble
 that could be found on the Sniggering Pig's floor in abundance.

\begin_layout Standard

Well, I'm not the stubborn, hot-headed, beautiful though foreign lady.

 Lernea stood by her sister's side and pondered for a moment before she
 said with a calm voice:

I think there's a reason for all this, sister.

 said the small man with a slight bow and a smile, before showing the sisters

 Parcifal looked at the man as he had insulted everything holy by Skrala

 She told her:

Now sister, this calls for some diplomacy.

Parcifal couldn't believe her ears, but followed along as if in some kind

 Winceham led the way and drew their chairs charmingly.
 As they sat down he made a motion with a hand to the bar, always smiling.
 Parcifal said as if still in a dream:

You knew that, didn't you? You saw us get off the boat, saw we smelled money

Then suddenly, the door to the Sniggering Pig Inn swung with an eerie creaking
 noise, unusually louder than the din of the laughing, merry sailors.
 A large bulky man dressed in a scaly leather vest, matching boots and cornered

 The music stopped abruptly.

 he yelled and spat a vile green lump of slime on the floor.
 Beside him stood a tall, ape-like creature dressed mostly in rugs and cloth,
 all muscle and hair.
 It carried a blunderbuss as tall as a man and grinned widely, its mouth
 filled with golden teeth.
 Like a silent church bell had rung, everyone, even the band, promptly picked
 up their hats and passed-out companions and left in a hurry, though the
 last man was mindful to enough to close the door behind him.
 Winceham reached out and touched the sisters' hands awkwardly; he had a
 desperate look on his face.

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged troubled looks.
 They shot glances at the man who had practically ordered everyone to leave

 There was fearful anxiety written there; the sisters shared their opinion

 Ned appeared from behind the bar, holding the sisters' coinpurse, still

Winceham rolled his eyes wildly trying to signal the sisters.
 His efforts went largely unnoticed since they had both turned to face what

 Parcifal had drawn her sword and was pointing it at Culliper's back.
 He slowly turned around and saw Lernea had also nocked an arrow, ready
 to draw at the blink of an eye.

 said Lernea who let an arrow fly right between Mr.
 Brumbles eyes before he had a chance to even swerve the gun their way.
 A gunshot rang clear though; Culliper was holding a pistol with smoldering
 smoke trailing off its barrel.
 Ned's father was down on the floor with a dull thud barely a moment later.
 Parcifal sprang at Culliper with all the might of her sword, but he parried
 expertly with his cutlass as he turned to leave.
 Lernea was reloading her bow even as Ned cried in outrage,

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper jumped up on a nearby table and rushed towards a window.
 Lernea's arrow caught him on the shoulder.
 He cried in agony even as Ned was rushing right behind him.
 Parcifal saw the barrel of a pistol aiming blindly towards Ned, even as
 Culliper made ready to jump through the window; she did not hesitate and
 grabbed Ned by his waist as he run.
 She brought him down right when a bullet flew over his head and turned
 part of the wooden bar into a bunch of smoldering splinters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper crashed through the window and onto the street.
 He landed on one side, rolled, and quickly got back on his feet.
 He glanced at them and then ran away cursing even as one of Lernea's arrows
 grazed his back.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Quickly!

Why are you just standing there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked, even though no-one was technically standing.
 Parcifal was on her knees, nurturing a hurt jaw.
 She had a bloody lip and she was staring at Ned like a wounded tiger.
 Ned was lying with his back against the bar, a stream of tears trailing
 his cheeks, his face flustered.
 Winceham was sitting on the same chair as before, his face planted smugly
 in the palms of his hands in complete silence.

\begin_layout Standard

He punched me in the face,

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was wholly ignoring her, his face a mask of stone cold grief.
 His tears had just began to dry out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea suddenly looked deeply disappointed, almost heartbroken, as she held
 an arrow in one hand and her bow in the other, her shoulders sagged.
 She shook her head, put the arrow in her quiver and the bow across her
 back before she pointed a finger at Parcifal and said with a numb voice
 to no-one in particular:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters both turned to look at him with an even gaze.
 They met his blood-ridden eyes and with a glance saw his father's lifeless
 body on the floor to his right.
 They stooped their heads low and crossed their arms on their chests before
 they told him humbly in unison:

Ned looked at them with menace, a sudden viciousness in the young man's
 otherwise gentle, homely face.
 His voice was calm, but it somehow managed to sound brazen, harsh and vibrant:
\end_layout

My father has no need for keen wails and haughty words.
 He's dead and dead men have no need of anything other than a grave.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters remained silent, neither one venturing to speak her mind.
 Winceham broke the silence when he rubbed his face with both hands along
 with a loud snorting noise, as if he had forced himself to awaken from
 a deep slumber.
 He caused everyone, even Ned, to turn their heads his way.

\begin_layout Standard

Now you've done it, you really have.

 the inn.

\begin_layout Standard

Halfuin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Winceham and went on after he tried to sip from an empty cup.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You could've just bought the act.
 And then, again, you could have just let Culliper take the damn money.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Our money,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It still is just money,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham with a sneer, before he went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would have kept Vern alive and this place going for some time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and waved a hand around.
 He picked up a small satchel from the floor and told them: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We've tarried too long.
 By midnight, Hobb's men will be scouring the Bay.
 I suggest you make yourselves scarce as well and keep a low profile.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded at the two sisters and said with a dry voice: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dump the gear as well, you two,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before he turned to Ned and said with a weary look and a bleak voice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry, Ned.
 There is no perfect plan.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Ned replied with a deep, rumbling hatred in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll kill his men.
 And then I'll kill him, with my bare hands.
 I want to see him beg for his life before I squeeze his last breath out

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had a feral look about him; a keen, proud gaze.
 It was as if he had been Ned's long lost twin, a battle-hardened warrior
 who sought revenge.
 In truth, he was still little more than the meek, aspiring bard son of
 Vern Larkin, doubling as the inn's cook.
 And Winceham told him so, trying not to sound unkind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Lad, you've a fiery heart, I'll give you that.
 But it's in the wrong place.

Parcifal interjected with a nod of approval:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

At least he is a man, red blood coursing through his veins.
 Willing to spill other men's blood, no less,

and quite a punch.
 Better than his jokes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Winceham's face frowned and turned to look at Parcifal with an impossible

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I beg your pardon, milady, but surely, you're sorely mistaken.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea approached the rest and came to stand by her sister's side with a
 regal smile painted on her face, her hands on her hips.
 She pointed a finger at Winceham as if he was some kind of lowly subject
 of hers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You, halfuin, you are the one who is sorely mistaken.

Winceham sighed and stared at the empty cup for a while.
 He then told Lernea:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You figured all that out by yourself? And I thought, Nomos was full of stupid

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea went wide-eyed in shocked surprise.
 Before she had time to retort, Parcifal had her sword drawn, poised in
 front of Winceham's chest, ready to pierce his heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Forswear that insult! Unsay it or Encelados be your last woe!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Parcifal with a blistering voice.
 Winceham, seeing the steely tip of Encelados flash brightly in the candlelight,
 spoke faster than perhaps ever, in one breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You do have a penchant for the dramatic, don't you? I was only making an
 effort to be sarcastic.
 Since it seems to be an idea foreign to you, I'm particularly sorry I ever
 said such a thing so as to raise your deadly ire.
 I therefore renounce my comment, recant the implication of an insult, renege
 my former statement and repudiate my previous statement regarding your
 noble persons.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Parcifal sheathed her sword and calmness returned to her face, while Lernea
 found the clarity of mind to reply properly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No need to mock us with fancy words, sir,

 she said, and forced a thin smile on her mouth.
 She went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We know enough about sarcasm to not use it in serious matters.
 We've been trained in languages and the arts, as well as the ways of the
 sword, bow and armor.
 Such is the way of Nomos; we are not simpletons, mind you.
 We are warrior-maidens of the Mountain Garden, not simple women who would
 rather spent their days serving a lowly, unworthy husband as their master.
 We demand respect and earn it our way; we obey the laws but listen to our

 We serve Skrala, until Svarna guides us to the Eternal Light.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea managed to awe everyone into stilled silence, including her sister.
 Winceham managed to nod, yet enchanted by Lernea's presence.
 The silence was broken by Ned, who took Lernea by the arm suddenly and
 spoke from heart, the words rushing freely out his mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You've spoken true milady; even a fool would feel that.
 I know this then; that you and your sister are noble women, with brave,

 Help me avenge my father's death, miladies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked at Ned with a surprised half-smile; it seemed he was being
 utterly serious and fully aware of what such an oath entailed.
 Parcifal saw her sister's face brighten up.
 She placed her hand gently on Ned's shoulder and told him heartily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's no need for that Ned.
 We are free women and our people, are free people; we do not offer them

 We are honored that you ask this of us; we shall avenge your father's demise,

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's face was overcome by a hard, edgy smile that crept up on his lips.
 He nodded solemnly and offered his arm to Parcifal which she grasped firmly.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a set of proud eyes and said with a
 hint of admiration:

Winceham on the other hand was half-way towards the doorway of the Sniggering

Do you even hear yourselves? I can understand Ned is upset and has little

 He went on promptly as soon as Lernea nodded matter-of-factly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He does as he pleases and that is due to two things; money and power.
 Money keeps his henchmen, guards and foot soldiers happy to work and even
 die occasionally for him, as do the crews on his ships roaming the seas
 for loot and plunder.
 That same money, the money he keeps making by bleeding everyone just short
 of dry, just like he did to Vern and the Sniggering Pig.
 That money bought him an Imperial Consulate and soon if word has it right,
 a place as Princeps of the Court.

 Winceham smiled with irony and said:

 Lernea told them, and Winceham retorted:

No, you'll have a retired thief and a bard who can't sing and tells bad

 Lernea asked Ned, cocking her head sideways.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why do you think you caught me red-handed both times? My joints have been

 Lernea's words had a hint of arrogance about them:

I see.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham eying Ned with a look of disappointment before returning
 his gaze to Lernea and adding: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then when you learn I'm retired, I'm suddenly worthless.
 Great management skills for a queen,

 said Winceham, looking irreparably emotionally hurt.

She didn't see the Jangdrivals coming either.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned intervened:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Stop this, please.
 Stop this badmouthing.
 It leads nowhere.
 If we are going to do this, we need to stick together; we need to support

 Or else, no matter who stands against us, it will be an easy fight for
 them if we fight amongst ourselves.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone took a moment in silence.
 Parcifal and Lernea looked at each other briefly, reassuringly.
 Winceham nodded to himself and pouted his lips before speaking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need a plan.
 A damn good plan preferably of the genius kind with implausibly good luck
 to boot.
 But first, we need to leave this place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and picked up his satchel, looking sideways through the window
 for any sign of Hobb's men.
 Parcifal and Lernea nodded and checked their gear smartly, while Ned shook
 his head and curtly said:

Ned, lad.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stared at Winceham unyieldingly for a few moments, until they all looked
 at each other and simply walked over to the body of Ned's father and helped
 him carry the body of Vern Larkin out back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was on the lookout, while Ned, Parcifal and even Lernea, much to
 her sister's surprise, began to dig in a hurry.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal who had taken point alongside Ned, Encelados firmly clasped
 on her back along with her shield, Erymanthos.
 Tiny slithers of starlight bounced off her glistening armor; the Holy Mountain
 engraved on Erymanthos shone fiery red.
 This far south in the world, the light of the starry sky was good enough
 for walking without hitting a tree.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Father and I used to hunt boar around these parts.
 We'd find traces of the Woodkin here and there; tripped animal traps and

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Ned with certainty, his eyes wading through the darkness of the
 night warily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned struck the others as a fairly common young man; not too short, not taller
 than Parcifal.
 He carried an old hunting crossbow strung along the belt at his waist.
 With his pitch black hair and light cloth garments, he gave the impression
 of some sort of romantic fool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That image was enhanced by the small leather drum he carried around on his

How can you be sure it was elves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham slightly out of breath as he tried to keep pace with the
 rest, his satchel bobbing wildly.
 Ned's reply was taciturn at best:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A somewhat uneasy silence followed.
 Lernea gracefully trod through the thick, lush brush as if this southern,
 exotic forest was her natural habitat.
 At length she too felt the need to ask Ned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

These elves you speak of, what makes you so certain they'll want to help?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned paused in his stride, turned around and looked at Lernea with a grin
 that shone unnervingly even though the light of the stars was barely enough
 to see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said loudly, his voice echoing faintly as it bounced off the surrounding
 hills.
 He resumed walking alongside Parcifal, his eyes glancing at everyone with
 obvious aggravation; apparently, he wasn't in the mood for questions.
 The others exchanged doubtful looks, but knew that for the time being,
 questions would serve no purpose other than driving Ned slightly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had been slowly climbing Silkcrest Hill, no more than an hour's reach
 from Hobb's Bay to the west.
 The minute after they had finished burying Ned's father, they had heard
 a rather rowdy crowd on the street, asking for them to come out and be
 hanged for the murders they had committed.
 Hobb seemed fairly adept at putting the blame on people and rousing the
 masses into an angry mob; Ned, Winceham and the Teletha sisters were wanted
 for murder, jaywalking and unlawful pillaging to boot.
 Without the need to talk it over, they fled Hobb's bay through obscure
 alleys and deserted back streets onto the nearby woods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned had come up with what was now effectively their grand plan, which wasn't
 much as everyone had commented, but it was their best shot.
 Not to mention, as Winceham had put it, their only and perhaps their last
 one as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They'd seek out the secretive Woodkin elves that some said dwelt deep in
 the jungle where death lurked in many forms: quicksand, and poisoned plants
 made the jungle perilous to cross, while snakes, rockatoos, crocodiles
 and venom spiders tried to literally lived on reckless travelers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham made a gesture with his hands, stopped and bent over his knees;
 his face was a grimace, his lungs burning from the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can't stop now, not until we've found them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a sense of urgency.
 He sounded annoyed, but there was tiredness in his tone as well.
 The sisters nodded and Parcifal unsheathed Encelados; she promptly buried
 it into the ground with ease.
 Lernea sat down on the ground and unclasped a bright, silver canteen from
 her belt.
 She brought it to her lips and drank, before offering it to Winceham who
 gladly downed a mouthful himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Ned in utter disbelief, even though it was plainly obvious they were
 taking a break.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can't march all through the night without some rest, Ned.
 Not us, not you, and certainly not half-man there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal and pointed to Winceham with a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin.
 Do I need to spell it out to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Winceham retorted huffing and puffing copiously.
 He shot Parcifal a weary look and sat down himself with a growl of exertion.
 He shook his head and said somewhat bitterly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You wouldn't have gone that far now, would you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, her words not unkind but rather playful judging by the thin
 smile on her face.
 Her look became suddenly worried though when she noticed Ned had already
 wandered off westwards, without so much as a word, like a stubborn child
 would.
 Lernea gave Parcifal a stern look which her sister waved away.
 Parcifal shrugged, resting with her hands around Encelados hilt, the blade's
 tip firmly dug in the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 she said as she looked at Ned's figure growing smaller in the growing distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he's bound to get lost or do something stupid.
 Or both.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Lernea and swiftly set after Ned on her own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham stretched.
 Some faint popping and crackling sounds were heard; he let out a sigh and
 fiddled with his satchel.
 After a while he was holding a small leather pouch and a small, delicate
 pipe in his hands.
 Those items seemed to instantly attract Parcifal's attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked bluntly, cocking her head sideways as if trying to peek.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does it look like to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham without affording her even a glance, too busy filling his
 pipe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Some sort of pipe, perhaps?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Parcifal with carefully measured uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm surprised someone imparted with such a high level of intelligence would
 be so levelheaded as to ask men of lesser caliber like my person such paltry
 questions for the mere sake of conversation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and lit his pipe, drawing in the smoke deeply.
 A smile of pure joy formed on his face and he laid himself flat on the
 ground, little wisps of smoke twirling intensely wherever starlight poured
 through as they wafted upwards around his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head around to venture a look towards her sister and
 Ned.
 Her eyes searched for them intently but she could barely make their shadows
 further up the hill, shrouded by the tall grass.
 They seemed to have stopped and they were probably talking by the way she
 saw her sister flailing her hands about her.
 She then asked Winceham with a rather peculiar voice, as if she was concerned
 someone might overhear them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could I .
 .
 .
 Could I have a whiff of that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham sat upright slowly and opened his eyes languidly; they were red-shot,
 covered in a slightly glazed sheen.
 He looked all-too serene and calm, his face adorned with a lopsided smile
 that verged on drooling.
 He simply passed Parcifal the pipe and nodded as if his head weighed a
 ton, his eyes half-open as if about to yawn and fall asleep to never wake
 up again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal leaned toward Winceham and took the proffered pipe in one hand.
 She took a drag and held it before closing her eyes, her lip curling in
 a slight grin.
 She then blew out the smoke in the shape of small circles, before handing
 back the pipe.
 She straightened her back and stood watchful as ever Encelados always clasped
 in her hands, her gaze and indeed her whole face standing out in the night,
 prouder and brighter than before.
 It was a stark contrast to the way Winceham looked, which resembled someone
 who had just woken up from a really rough night that involved all sorts
 of debauchery and a lynch mob.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey..
 What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham as he looked back and forth between Parcifal and the pipe
 with an expression of amazed wonder as if something miraculously extraordinary
 had happened right in front of his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he thought he saw a pair of trembling flames behind a nearby bush.
 He blinked and saw the flames flicker wildly, before vanishing swiftly
 with a harrowing speed.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What in all blazes? I must be having a bad trip,

 said Winceham mostly to himself and put out his pipe.
 Parcifal overheard him and commented:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not that rough of a trail.
 When my sister and I had to go through the trails of Jordenfall though..
 That was rough, I'll tell you that.
 Sheer cliffs, hundreds of feet high, slippery ice every step of the way

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Her face was cringing but her voice carried a bitter sweetness.
 It was the voice of someone who reminisced better times.
 Winceham eyed her with a worried look, his brow furrowed.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure you're okay? Not feeling lightheaded, sleepy, giggly, silly,

 She took a moment to think, shook her head and replied earnestly:

\end_inset

No..
 Couldn't be better.
 Top notch.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was looking at her puzzled beyond understanding when his eyes bulged
 up with sudden terror.
 He saw the trembling flames from before, trailing orange light in their
 wake.
 They were attached to the head of furry white bunny where its eye sockets
 should be; the hopped about, not further than a few feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham's jaw dropped and he looked at his pipe before staring at the bunny
 mesmerized.
 The bunny paused as if it knew, stared back at Winceham and smiled unnervingly
 before hopping out of view and into a burrowing hole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Did you see that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he exclaimed as he got up on his feet and poked Parcifal in the arm repeatedly.
 She was instantly energized; she drew Encelados out of the ground and swung
 it around her wrist expertly, poised to strike unerringly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Winceham with an unsteady voice and pulled out a stiletto from his
 belt.
 The blade was dull, thin and long like a spike.
 It had been quite some time since it had been last used.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Great, that's great.
 I'm not having a bad trip, it's just that something actually weird is going
 on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and sighed.
 He collected his thoughts for a moment before trying to convince Parcifal
 that a strange rabbit with flaming eyes was in the vicinity.
 He felt that stressing the flaming eyes bit was essential since normal
 rabbits when mixed with fire can't hop, at least not when roasting on a
 spit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal, look.
 It might seem strange but there's a bunny with its eyes on fire hopping
 around us.
 I think it saw us.
 We must be very careful, stay still and keep our voices down.
 I can't stress enough that it's eyes are on fire and it's not dead yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham as he scanned the area around them inch by inch, expecting
 to catch a glimpse of the strange rabbit.
 Parcifal eyed the man with a sudden sorrow and shook her head, feeling
 sorry for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Poor Mr.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then as if out of nowhere a robed, hooded and masked man sprang from a nearby
 bush behind Parcifal and leaned respectfully towards her ear.
 The man waved his hands and fingers in an elaborate gesture and whispered
 to her in a thin, gentle voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is no bunny.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was stunned into silence.
 He was thinking that perhaps he should point out that there was a strange
 man right behind Parcifal whispering to her ear, but decided to wait until
 she acknowledged that herself, just to make sure he wasn't imagining things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal as she turned around to face the stranger with Encelados
 readied in her hand.
 She appeared calm, yet mindful of the stranger who seemed to be unarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No answer came.
 Instead the man simply stood there, frozen like a statue, his hands clasped
 together as if in prayer.
 His eyes remained closed and he hardly seemed to breathe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Will you not answer me, stranger?

 Parcifal demanded of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe he's right, maybe there is no bunny,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Winceham when he suddenly saw the same white bunny as before break
 through the ground from behind Parcifal.
 It stood there with it's eyes locked directly onto Winceham's gaze.
 Its nose twitched and Winceham saw the flames flash wildly for a moment,
 right before an intense feeling of chillness crept up his spine and made
 the hairs on his head stand.
 Then he saw the rabbit grin at him mischievously, dig back in and disappear
 from sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was pointing to the ground in stunned silence, with eyes wide open
 and his arm trembling when Parcifal said to the silent stranger:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am Parcifal Teletha, scion of Phedra Teletha and Helios of the Teletha

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her tone was noble yet carried determined menace.
 It was easy for someone to see she meant every word by her thunderous stare.
 The man opened his right eye, peeked at her momentarily, and then closed
 it and simply stood there just like before, as if choosing to ignore her.

\begin_layout Standard

 She added with exasperation:

I don't care about your delusions! What manner of person is this man who

 Winceham had no other option but try to sound convincing yelling at the

Winceham and Parcifal turned and looked at Lernea with red, flustered faces

 She threw them a scolding stare but what caught her eye was the strange

 She was confused for a moment.
 When she stared back at him with all the nobility she could muster under

 he said to Lernea, stressing the last word as if the absurdness contained

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged a quick look.
 Parcifal nodded affirmatively while Lernea replied with an indifferent
 shrug.
 Winceham said then visibly irritated:

I beg your pardon! Bo is not a monster!

 said the robed man insulted, instantly letting go off his prohibitions
 concerning the fact he was completely visible to everyone involved.
 He took off his mask and hood as well, revealing long fair and silver dreadlock
s of hair, and a pair of pointy ears that stood effortlessly upright.
 He protested:

Bo is very kind and completely harmless.
 Not a monster at all.

Yes, who are you? And how come your hair is that fair and weird-looking

Ned's right.

Bo? He's always around, I wouldn't worry about him.

You're Woodkin, aren't you?

 The stranger gasped; he was once more shocked into silence for a moment

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How...

 he said with a tremor in his voice.

Winceham cut in abruptly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The pointy ears, the fair, weird hair.
 The silly hood and mask.
 That's just like you people.

The stranger shot an off-beat glance at Winceham and managed to sound actually

We even know the bunny by name, but not yours.

 said Parcifal and raised Encelados threateningly.
 Ned lowered her arm and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down now.
 What is your name, woodkin?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The woodkin looked at the sword's blade respectfully and then addressed
 Ned with a slight bow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

My name is Hanultheofodor Trypthwifidyr.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned seemed to cringe at the thought of uttering the name fully, so he simply
 offered his hand and smile thinly but reassuringly.
 The woodkin obliged him somewhat awkwardly after noticing that everyone
 had their eyes fixed on him.
 As he shook hands with Ned, Lernea told him:

Take us to your leader!

They passed a series of crests and low hills shrouded in ever-thickening
 bush and tall, wide-trunked trees.
 The savanna forest had indeed turned into a jungle proper, full of mangroves
 and palm trees, thick grub and lush flower plants blocking their way.
 `Theo', which was how everyone called Hanultheofodor for practical purposes,
 knew the terrain well enough to avoid the thicker parts, but occasionally
 he had to use his machete to cut a path through.
 The air smelled of sweet but deadly flowers and acrid sweat as the wetness
 of the place became bothersome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their progress was just as slow as before; Parcifal had dubbed it half-man
 pace and Winceham had insisted on at least calling it a halfuin pace for
 the sake of proper interspecies etiquette.
 He had quietened down soon afterward though when he became acutely aware
 that being so short and therefore close to the jungle floor bed was disadvantag
eous at best; the realisation came after he had stepped on a snake thicker
 than his arm and longer than imagination allowed for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snake had been easily dealt with a chop from Parcifal's blade.
 She made Winceham owe her one and even placed a bet that he'd owe her more
 further down the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the woodkin village still out of view, Parcifal and Theo were leading
 the way.
 Encelados was drawn in her hand should anything try and surprise them;
 she had more than balked at the idea of using her blade as a grass-cutter.
 Even Lernea admonished she had only once seen her sister so frightfully
 indignant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked silently, taking care not to step on something that could bite
 back, each one lost in their own thoughts, for their own reasons.
 At length, Theo asked Parcifal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So none of them followed you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

None that we could see, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which reminds me, I have to ask: How is it that your sister could see me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal found the question nonsensical at best, but her blinking stare
 failed to convey that feeling to Theo.
 He waited for an answer, smiling affably, while the only thing Parcifal
 could conjure in words was:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that a question? You want to know how it is that my sister could see
 you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course! Counter-spelling an illusionist's Ethereal Trance is a remarkable
 feat for someone not versed in the art of Choujou,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and Parcifal raised an eyebrow.
 She suspected Theo, their informal but helpful impromptu guide, had thought
 he could turn invisible for some weird reason that might or might not include
 an unreasonable amount of dreamhops or fuddlegrass, just like the kind
 Winceham had shared with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You are the illusionist you are referring to, I'd wager?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Indeed.
 Are you familiar with the Choujou school of magic?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not really, no,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a weary voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ah, its tradition goes back thousands of years.
 The ever-grazing mist of time has long ago obscured its deepest secrets,
 but my people have preserved its legacy and the source of its real power,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he cut a thick, rich cluster of foliage with a few chops of
 his machete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was suddenly intrigued at the mention of the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

power
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

my people
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 The thought came to her that perhaps Ned had been right to convince them
 to seek the Woodkin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was, if of course the rest of Theo's kin had a firm grasp of this witchcraf
t he talked about.
 Because it was her informed opinion that the young woodkin elf was a bit
 lightheaded, to put it mildly.
 She had no idea what to make of his peculiar animal companion though, other
 than stew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo hopped in and out of the ground, the flames in his eyes lighting up the
 path ahead with a warm orange light.
 The bunny would at times pause, raise itself on its hind legs and shoot
 the party a glance before burrowing in the ground, only to appear a couple
 of minutes later down the path as suddenly as it had disappeared.
 But it never strayed away from Theo for too long; that did not escape Winceham'
s attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See it? There; and there it is again.
 It just keeps doing that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham to Ned with a raspy, aggravated voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's just a bunny, Winceham.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned shook his head and looked at Winceham sideways while he said: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's just your imagination, Winceham.
 It's been a long, difficult night and it's only a couple of hours until

\begin_layout Standard

 asked Winceham with a worried expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like he said, it's some condition or other.
 I've heard of stranger things; of wild beasts that will turn you into stone,

 A rabbit with flaming eyes doesn't sound all that dangerous.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Those were the drunken tales of rabid sailors, Ned! While this..

 said Winceham with a half-crazed look on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I recall yourself as well sharing such morbid tales of fascinating creatures

 Could this be just another fantasy of yours?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned with a gentle smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham made a gesture of acceptance with both hands and replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, I may have from time to time exaggerated concerning some of my former
 adventures, especially when women and riches were mentioned, but it was
 merely in order to put some polish in the boring details.
 This though.
 .

 This rabbit.
 It has its eye on me, I tell you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stopped and took Winceham by the shoulder.
 His face became grim, his voice unusually stern and cold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've invoked Nadragatea on you, Winceham.
 This is one tale you'll have to follow to the end, you know that.
 Don't just pretend; your life depends on that as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham looked instantly and genuinely hurt; his eyes searched Ned's face
 for signs of the young lad who had grown into as much as a friend as his
 father.
 He saw little of the boy he remembered; instead, he was looking at a strong-wil
led man, indeed more than the boy's father had ever been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're right laddie, I'm full of it.
 Well, sometimes.
 I'm just saying, I don't like that bunny one bit, that's all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, sounding apologetic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded with an understanding look.
 He motioned them to move on again even as Lernea caught up from behind,
 where she had been scouting from the last hilltop they had climbed down
 from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing, for as far as I could see.
 No-one is on our trail.
 If someone's out this far to get us, they're probably lost someplace or
 coming at us from a totally different direction.
 No torches or lamps, or light of any kind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, a little short on breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't know what to expect from Hobb.
 It does make sense though; they sent a mob after us, but we weren't there.
 As long as we're out of the picture, Hobb will have the Sniggering Pig
 to himself anyway.
 As far as he's concerned, we've turned tail and ran, never to show our
 faces again,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned told Lernea, who in turn asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What about the ape-man? Won't that man, Culliper, seek revenge for his comrade?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Culliper?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cut in Winceham with a snorting laughter full of disbelief and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sea-maggot is a slave-driver, pure and simple.
 The only thing he cares about is his hide and his loot.
 For the right coin, Culliper could be working for anyone.
 Though I hear those ape-men are hard to come by, I wouldn't worry about
 Culliper.
 Not until we meet him on our own terms.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded in agreement.
 He had a bitter, austere look carved across his face when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You leave Culliper to me when the time comes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When the time comes, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Winceham with rare somberness.
 Lernea was about to ask something when she saw her sister only a few dozen
 yards up ahead signal a message with her hands.
 Parcifal had stooped low, her gaze wandering, searching for something in
 the night.
 Lernea nocked an arrow when she saw Encelados' suddenly glow faintly; the
 glow became stronger with every passing moment.
 She signaled back at Parcifal who acknowledged with a simple nod.
 She had to reign in Theo's mouth with her free hand.
 It seemed to her that the woodkin had a very vague idea of danger, as something
 that could only affect other people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A faint hope of Winceham being mistaken in his assumption that something
 was amiss sprung up inside him.
 He felt he had to ask in a low voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The sword's glowing? Is that normal?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

She simply shook her head and without turning her head replied:

Something evil lurks nearby.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ned fed a bolt in his crossbow and readied it in his hand, even as Winceham
 drew his stiletto and headed off amidst the thick brush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned with urgency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I'll scout around.
 Need to make myself sparse if I am to strike from the shadows, lad.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a moonless night, there's shadows everywhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned sounding confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Exactly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and nodded to Lernea who afforded him a thin grin.
 Within a few moment, he had melted away into the shadows that abounded,
 as if he'd never really been there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How did he do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Lernea to Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a thief,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned as they warily made their way closer to Parcifal and Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Retired,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she hissed and Ned simply shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Makes for a weak alibi in some lands,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he replied and Lernea shook her head.
 As they approached Parcifal, they saw her hand-signaling furiously; her
 face was almost obscured in the shadow of a nearby tree but they could
 see her face was taut with bone-breaking intensity.
 The hand signals were confused, hasty; Lernea couldn't make out what her
 sister was trying to tell her in silence.
 She shook her head and waved her to repeat, while Ned was right beside
 her, aiming his crossbow at a thick patch of utter blackness that seemed
 most inviting for something that could be lurking out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then noticed the bunny; it was looking straight at him, the flames from
 his eyes having died down to a pair of crackling embers.
 The bunny curled its tiny lips into an impossible grin just for Ned alone
 to see and hurriedly burrowed inside the ground in an instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed to sigh even as Encelados began to glow fiercely, casting
 harrowing shadows of Parcifal and Theo around the thick brush.
 Parcifal repeated her message but to no avail; Lernea shook her head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is she trying to say?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's either large flying beast lurking on the treetops or mythical magical
 beast wandering up ahead, I can't tell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned swallowed hard at that piece of information; he couldn't understand
 what the difference really was, so he simply asked, his voice trembling
 slightly, hinting of mounting tension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How is one, better news than the other?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's really important to know which one's which.
 I claim flying kills first, while Parcifal claims the land-dwellers,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said matter-of-factly as she signaled her sister they were about to
 sprint within whispering distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, isn't that wonderful? What happens if it's a sea creature, or something
 that lives underground?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked ironically, surprised at the nonchalance of Lernea, as well as
 his own reaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coin toss,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as the irony was lost on her.
 She nearly dragged Ned alongside her as they ran, stooping low, to cover
 the distance between Parcifal and them.
 Their feet shuffled over the thick boggy ground with a squishy noise.
 When they were within earshot, Parcifal turned around and whispered to
 her sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I said, it's a bleeding flying lizard!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Theo managed to answered promptly when he finally pushed Parcifal's
 hand aside.
 Completely heedless of the need to remain as silent as possible, he made
 sure to stand up in order to deliver his point more acutely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's utterly absurd! It's not a lizard, that's a dragonkin pure and simple.
 It is a fairly easy mistake to make though, since-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo was cut mid-sentence as a loud screeching noise like a sad, horrific
 growl was quickly followed by the figure of a muscular, nine-foot tall
 lizard-like creature swooping down from the treetops towards them.
 A set of unnervingly sharp-looking claws the size of short curvy blades
 extended from its feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get down you muttering fool!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and thrust herself on Theo, bringing him down even as Ned shot
 his crossbow reflexively.
 Ned's shot missed wildly, unlike Parcifal.
 Timing her thrust, Encelados met with the creature's belly as it tried
 to leap upwards again, to hide in the lush canopy or have another go at
 them at its leisure.
 That was no longer possible, as Parcifal's blade brought it down after
 a couple of yards thrashing, wailing its high-pitched death throes in anguish,
 blood gushing freely from a lengthy wound, the creature's ghastly innards
 freely exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal quickly walked over to the dying creature and stood above it as
 it lay there, dying meekly.
 Theo exclaimed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jah be with us! That dragonkin-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea could not resist the urge; she slapped him hard across the face and
 told him as he stood in frozen disbelief:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's for being an idiot.
 You can thank me for saving your life later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo tried to force his mouth to make audible sounds form into a semblance
 of speech, while Parcifal held Encelados shoulder high and said ceremoniously:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unto the abyssal chasm I comment thee, beast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She swung Encelados down sharply and the creature's head came off its neck
 clean, like a slice of fruit.
 The pool of blood around its lifeless body was already beginning to clog,
 while the cut below the head was almost clean dry.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a mischievous look, underlined by a
 gleeful grin:

Theo swallowed hard and managed to regain a measure of composure.
 He laid himself down near the creature, muttering mostly to himself:

The sisters exchanged terms and conditions loudly, fighting over first kill

 to no-one in particular:

If that thing was evil, and that sword of yours detects evil in all its

\begin_layout Standard
Theo chimed in morosely:

Because that dragonkin was Vulsek, my flying steed.
 He wasn't evil, just scared.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters heard that and paused to wonder even as Parsifal shot a look
 at Encelados.
 It was indeed glowing with dazzling ferocity.
 They exchanged knowing worried looks when suddenly Winceham burst forth
 from a patch of tall grass running with all the speed his stature and years
 allowed.
 He shouted something indelible to the others without turning around to
 look, and lost himself through another thick bush behind the crest of a
 ravine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What did he say? Something about a rat and a tip?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned as he fumbled with his crossbow, trying to reload it in a hurry,
 shooting worried glances at the wild grass in the meantime.

The bunny then popped up in front of him from underground, and started running
 around in circles, the flames from its eyes whirling in a blinding fashion.

Bo looks excited about something.
 Maybe Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and then suddenly a trio of bipedal mushrooms holding iron spears
 and using their tops as shields came out of the thick grass running awkwardly,
 exchanging long-winded moaning sounds and pointing at Theo and the rest
 aggressively, if one were to judge by the way the spears faced towards
 the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure Winceham has a thing for mushrooms,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Lernea and let the string of her bow sing sharply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd say he's more into greens, I assure you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a shake of her head and rushed the warrior-mushrooms
 head on, whirling Encelados with wild abandon.
 Ned was looking at the scene in front of him as if it were only a dream;
 he had a sudden epiphany then and told Theo who was waving his hands about
 him in a ridiculously complicated manner in what seemed to be preparation
 for a spell:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Did you hear the joke about the fungus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

No, what joke?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could tell you now, but it might need time to grow on you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and grinned while Theo stood pondering as his hands filled with
 a shiny, blue ball of crackling energy.
 Ned let a bolt fly straight through the mouth of a raging mushroom-warrior
 which plucked half its head off and brought it down with a flop.
 Lernea was reloading her bow after her first arrow got stuck on a mushroom
 cap, and Parcifal poised Encelados for yet another slash at the wild mushroom-m
an directly in front of her, expertly avoiding its thrusts and hacking it
 to death; it was a matter of few strokes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo suddenly shook with hearty laughter as the joke struck home, and at
 the same time hurtled a ball of lightning at a mushroom charging Lernea,
 its spurious gait almost laughable.
 The mushroom promptly exploded into a cloud of charred dust with fleshy
 bits of what used to form its torso flying around.
 The smell of burning fungi permeated the air.
 Parcifal made sure Encelados wasn't glowing any more before saying triumphantly
:
\end_layout

Such is the way Encelados pierces through the shadow of evil!

Lernea sounded demoralized, distraught even:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not fair! Even Ned killed one!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned ignored the comment on his abilities as a marksman and walked over the
 body of his kill, looking for his bolt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo sounded deliriously giggly, barely able to make sense when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

See, I get that! Fungi grow, and so will the joke, which is to say, already

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled thinly but pretty soon the smile vanished when Bo the Bunny reemerged
 in front of him and afforded him an uncannily wide smile.
 Ned had another flash of mind and asked everyone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is Winceham?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the bunny knew that Winceham was still running through brush and wood,
 over bog and marsh, muttering incoherently:

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal had apologized to Theo, but he still looked downcast and moody;
 he kept Bo the Bunny by his side always.
 Curiously enough, the usually rampant bunny obliged him.
 It was as if the animal could sense Theo's loss and sympathized; which
 wasn't the weirdest thing considering it was a bunny with flames writhing
 out of its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea and Ned had found Winceham inside a pool of slimy bog water, drenched
 in muck.
 They had a hard time convincing him that the mushroom warriors were real
 enough to end up dead.
 Winceham had told them he'd definitely quit when all this debacle was over;
 he felt had to clarify that he didn't mean that he'd quit the group.
 After exchanging a few puzzled looks, they were back on the trail that
 led to Theo's village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crack of dawn was upon them; they were tired and hungry, but they pressed
 on when Theo told them they were almost there.
 Through a clearing up ahead, they could suddenly see thick plumes of smoke
 rise up into the sky behind the last crest they had to pass in order to
 reach the village.
 Theo smiled brightly for the first time since his steed had been slain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh! They must be preparing a feast! That's never happened before!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The others exchanged knowing looks; that smoke was of an entirely different
 scale.
 Clouds of smoke that size usually meant that in the very unlikely event
 of a feast, something had gone terribly wrong.
 They hadn't the heart to tell Theo; he'd soon find out.
 Ned almost growled, his anger starting to boil his blood once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hobb.
 Hobb must've done this.
 Damn his name and soul.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham, who had mostly dried up by then, sighed and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This changes things for the worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while the sisters looked at the smoke with heavy, sombre frowns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If this really is Hobb's doing, it's no longer a matter of debt, pride,

 This is the work of evil; it must be cleansed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal and Lernea agreed with a nod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skrala, we swear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and carried onwards, beside Theo, his reality distorted by his
 naive, though well-mannered demeanor.
 Lernea looked at him with pity; his eyes met hers and his smile made her
 avert her gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo asked her and stopped as they had began to slowly climb the last hill.
 The others passed them by in silence on their way to the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was reminded of my home, suddenly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and found a reassuring core of truth to her words.
 An icy feeling of loneliness crept up on her; the terrible image of Nomos
 burning in her mind made her shudder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you cold, or maybe sick?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo disarmingly.
 He looked genuinely worried.
 Lernea held a tear with some effort and told him while she gently pushed
 him up the slope:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 That's all, Theo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She shook her head and smiled thinly, as they walked the last few feet to
 the top in silence.
 The others were already there, casting long, nimble shadows on the foliage.
 The sun had barely lifted itself above the lush green carpet of treetops,
 yet a warm light embraced their faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About Vulsek? It was an accident,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said without conviction.
 He was still trying to come to grips with that.
 When they reached the top, what was left of the village below was painfully
 in plain sight, fires still consuming small tree-houses, sheds and trees
 alike.
 Theo's jaw dropped in an instant, with Bo always by his side, the flames
 in his eyes dying down suddenly.
 Lernea touched Theo's hand gently and told him in an almost broken voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry about your village.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words failed him.
 He sank to his knees and fell on the ground, as if the last iota of strength
 had left him.
 Winceham awkwardly put a hand around his shoulder and said nothing.
 Ned looked with mounting anger at the burning village, his eyes wandering
 aimlessly as if trying to comprehend something illogical; the crackle of
 fire reached them with ominous clarity.
 Trees had burned down to a crispy cinder, leaving nothing but ashes and
 smoldering stumps behind them.
 Wooden tree-bridges laid in ruins, half-eaten by the flames, the houses
 at the top of the trees burning away like huge candles, burning flakes
 wafting in the air like a fiery snowfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun came up, its first rays lost in the glow of the fires.
 It was an unruly sight, but no-one looked away; each one of them was lost
 in their own thoughts.
 Theo finally broke down in tears, and a tender sob took over him.
 Bo turned his head to Theo and wrinkled his nose; his whiskers twitched
 and his eyes lit up with a subdued flame before he ran down the hill, stopped
 and turned to look straight at Ned.
 He hopped a couple of times before running down the hillside, towards the
 village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He wants us to follow him.
 Could he have smelled something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and set out after the bunny.
 Parcifal shrugged a little and followed close by, while Winceham told Theo
 with a gentle voice down to a whisper:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll get him laddie.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo managed to stem the tears and said flatly, his eyes lost somewhere
 beyond the burning trees:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No evil deed goes unpunished, Theo,

 Winceham shot her a troubled look and said:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

To which she replied sternly:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo staggered at first, then wiped his eyes with his robe, stifling another
 sob as they slowly walked downhill.
 The fire was still slowly consuming everything it touched, but it had mostly
 died down where it had met the rather soggy, dense forest around the grove
 where the village had once stood.
 What was left of it, was burning slowly like candle wax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny was standing on a well at the village's entrance.
 It was hopping and bouncing around like driven suddenly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bo's found someone!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Theo and ran to the well.
 Parcifal was looking at the edge of the village warily; she could not escape
 a feeling of danger.
 Winceham hunched low and put his senses to good use, while Lernea asked
 Ned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Could Hobb have done this? Burned down a whole village? Why would he do
 that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

I'm not sure.

 said Ned with a puzzled, worried frown.
 Lernea looked around and said knowingly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are no bodies.
 There's no smell of charred flesh either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham turned around and told them, rubbing his fingers full of dirt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's because they took everyone.
 At least two dozen strong, deep tracks all over the place.
 Heavy armor probably.
 There are no traces of a fight; there's a strange, faint smell of iron
 though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not everyone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo as he helped an elder-looking woodkin climb out of the well.
 His plain robes were smudged and stained with soot, his face was dark.
 Grizzly long dreadlocks adorned his head, where a wooden circlet sat.
 The Elder smiled copiously as he sat down on the ground, obviously exhausted.

Parcifal shot the woodkin a suspicious look, her eyes going back and forth
 between the elder and Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked, clutching Encelados' hilt nervously.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo with a furrowed brow as he helped Fingammon to his flask of
 water.
 The Elder waved the flask away and looked at Parcifal in the eyes.
 His voice had a strange, gravely quality.
 It was hoarse and he talked in a drawn out, strangely exotic way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She looked at the dark-skinned elder woodkin as if measuring him for a moment.
 She then seemed content, and relaxed a bit.
 Still, she kept a wary look for anything out of the ordinary, whatever
 her definition of ordinary was for a burning village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where is everyone? What happened?

 asked Theo with an urgent, choked voice.
 Lernea also looked at the elder with a curious gaze.
 She asked him:

How come you're not dead or missing like the others?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Winceham was still searching for tracks, when Ned placed a hand on Lernea
 and asked the elder kindly:

Fingammon the elder looked at Ned and nodded slowly.
 He spoke then, the strain on his voice bearing witness to his ordeal:

 he said and looked at Theo with a longing to be believed.
 The others didn't speak but Parcifal scoffed, and Ned folded his arms on
 his chest apprehensively.
 Lernea was now staring at the woodkin with a frown.
\end_layout

'Tis true, I know it be crazy, but 'tis true like dem fires.

 The woodkin spoke then:

 he said with an awed, humble voice and a hand that wove shapes in the air,
 trying to paint them a life-like picture.
 Parcifal shook her head and sheathed Encelados.
 She put her hands on her waist:

Winceham looked at her from where he was sitting crouched a few feet away.
 He didn't share her opinion:

There are strange things in this world.

 Parcifal took that comment as an insult and replied accordingly:

My sister and I are scions bred to rule, halfuin.

 Instead, her sister motioned with her hand for Parcifal to calm down.

 Winceham added:

The lad speaks the truth.
 Devious things, but their masters are the ones that control them, the ones

If they're made of iron, that would explain the strong scent I picked up.

 The crystal shone with iridescent colours and the girder was covered in
 a form of writing none had ever witnessed before, beautifully flowing and
 masterfully thin.
 Theo couldn't help staring at it with a sudden rush of curiosity; he looked
 inexplicably drawn to it, somehow.

 Winceham stretched his legs and worked his joints.

Alright then.

 Ned and Theo, you're last,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Theo did not seem to question her one bit.
 As the woodkin stood upright, he told Lernea with a fatherly voice:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those words brought a grin on Ned's face, while Winceham rolled his eyes

 They all set out towards the Lake, leaving the village's ruins to smolder
 under an overcast sky.

You don't really believe that story, do you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 her sister asked in a hushed voice as Theo led the way, Fingammon wearily
 trudging along by his side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Bo popped up from beneath the ground, right in front of her feet.
 He looked at her with eyes glowing hot as embers, before grinning widely
 directly at her and burrowing itself down again.
 A moment later it popped up right behind Theo, and followed him close by,
 happily hopping around him playfully, the flames around his eyes twirling
 like a torch at night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal answered her own question before Lernea could answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Never mind that.
 I guess a flying ship's not that weird,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and fell in line, Ned and Winceham close behind them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clouds were gathering.
 It was a hazy morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Part Three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was on watch, sitting at a ledge at the mouth of the cave.
 He hadn't really slept all that well; the physical exertion made his muscles
 ache but his troubled mind couldn't rest, and so he fidgeted nervously,
 never really getting a proper rest.
 Dark thoughts wrestled in his mind, and the need for revenge made his stomach
 churn and his heart thump mightily in his chest.
 He looked at the cloudy sky from the lip of the cave, his fingers gently
 caressing his drum, his sole possession in the world now and the last thing
 he loved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo couldn't sleep either; the realisation that almost his whole life he
 had been lied to, even if it seemed to be in everyone's best interest,
 was impossible to fathom.
 A lot of things were impossible for Theo to fathom actually, but this one
 in particular stung him like bees from hell.
 To top it off, there was no-one of his people to talk to about other than
 the elder, who having fully explained to him how he came to find him one
 day in the wounds, he fell asleep, the years on his back and the exhaustion
 from the ordeal with Hobb's raid having exerted their toll on the aged
 woodkin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo kept to himself, never uttering a word.
 He sat with his legs crossed, his eyes unable to part with the vista of
 his village burned to the ground.
 Little clouds of smoke still gathered above it, but the fires had been
 extinguished by that time, after having eating almost everything, leaving
 little for the eye to see that at one time, people had lived there.
 All that remained, was old Fingammon, sleeping in the cave deeply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned watched Theo absentmindedly, himself lost in thought.
 He had a sudden realisation then: if it wasn't for the ears and the bunny,
 it felt to him that he was watching himself.
 They had both lost their homes, and Theo had never met his parents; in
 a way, that was worse than what Ned was going through.
 At least he had some memories.
 But Theo, thought Ned, all he had to cry for was a bunny with a condition
 and an amulet that had only caused him disaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not easy, is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, speaking from the heart.
 Theo did not look at him, but simply remained silent, gazing outwards into
 the sky.
 Ned walked over him, and sat himself down on the bedrock beside Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My father was murdered last night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 The words spurred something in Theo.
 He looked thoughtful when he said softly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry for your loss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded and spent a moment or so watching Theo in silence.
 The bunny was with him always it seemed.
 Just holding Bo seemed to be more than important to Theo.
 The flames on Bo's eyes were a mere prickle of light at that time; he looked
 content, nibbling a thick wide leaf.
 It kept looking at Theo as if he knew things were hard for him.
 Ned thought it wasn't impossible for a flame-eyed rabbit to know such things.
 It didn't take an expert in magical beasts to realise it when Bo looked
 at them funny.
 This was one such time.
 Theo noticed the look Bo shot Ned, ears pointed eagerly upright, the prickles
 of light in its eyes brightening up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down Bo.
 He's not bad.
 The bad men are out there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo with a grittiness that his youthful, woodkin appearance belied.
 Ned spoke to him earnestly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what you're feeling right now.
 That would be a lie.
 But you haven't slept, and I couldn't do that either.
 I don't know if it's normal.
 But I'm not feeling tired.
 Sure, the legs hurt a bit, and my stomach's growling, but that's not the
 real pain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned let his words trail off awkwardly, remembering what had happened just
 the night before.
 He suppressed a tear and feeling somewhat embarrassed, looked the other
 way.
 They sat in relative silence for a few moments, interrupted by the far-away
 chirping of birds and Winceham's occasional saw-like snore.
 Theo broke the silence then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What was your father like?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's face contorted with a pained frown while he tried to find the words.
 He tried to put on a slightly sly smile and said:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's brow furrowed but not unkindly; it was simply the fact that Theo couldn't
 fail to surprise him every turn of the way.
 Being around him made everything normal acquire an interesting flair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right.
 Well, it wasn't that I was that bright, mind you; it's just that we burned
 her body.
 The plague, they said.
 I couldn't speak to her before she passed, for fear I'd catch what she
 had,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and looked at his feet for a while before adding, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think her last words I remember were `Go on, Ned.
 Be a good boy and help you father'
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo had an understanding look in his bright, green eyes.
 He pouted his lips slightly and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounds..
 Well, awful.
 At least, I never knew my real parents.
 I knew there was something funny about the skin color of everyone else,

 I never thought I was...
 Found,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he swallowed hard and let his voice trail off, his head lowered
 moodily.
 A smile crept up on Ned's face.
 Theo's naivety was bordering on stupidity as Parcifal would have it, but
 in his mind, Ned saw a child in a man's body, and that somehow reminded
 him of himself once more.
 Strangely, he felt that didn't bother him at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, we'll get your people back.

 He looked at Theo with a gleaming eye and went on:

 The bunny smiled back uncannily for only Theo to see.
 Ned replied truthfully:

No, not really.
 But this is what I have to do.

Theo spoke, his words carrying a touch of bitter sweetness:

 Theo looked at him with a wide, gentle smile, accented by the way its edges
 led to his long, pointy ears:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I may not have learned much, but I learned that fate is just what binds

Ned raised an eyebrow and seemed to give the notion some thought; he somehow
 felt lighter alongside the woodkin, as if he could lift his spirits.

If you put it like that, I have no regrets of a fate alongside you, Theo.

 simply being modest.

 He felt a bit proud, and a bit taller suddenly.

Now that you mention that, it brought to mind that joke of yours.

 Ned looked excited, and that carried on to the volume of his voice when
 he almost shouted:

 Theo nodded in silent affirmation and Bo raised his head alarmingly.
 Ned went on:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I know it's a little hard to play most omens, prophecies and tales with
 just a beating drum, but I believe it has great potential.
 Maybe if more bards got together and everyone played a different instrument,
 I could be, you know, supporting their music with beating the drum.
 And then we could tour, get the crowd rolling.
 It could be amazing,

 said Ned with childish excitement overrunning his voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't want to put you off, but that sounds all wrong.
 I mean, who would want to see the same bards over and over again? And everyone
 singing at the same time? Think of the cacophony.
 Come to think of it, how do you play notes on that thing? I don't see any
 keys, strings or pipes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo without thinking about it at all.
 His disarmingly blunt honesty fired Ned up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't have notes! It does have tone values though! And it needs tuning

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Ned with a sudden pang of mild anger.
 The bunny's eyes produced a burst of flames as Bo turned and looked at
 him with a twitchy nose.
 Theo simply spoke his mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm just saying, it would be better to stick to the jokes for now.

Ned thought about that for a while.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A team of bards? It's not a race, or a game.
 It's art; it will be a band of bards.

Theo shook his head with a frown.

I don't think that would work.

Oh, well.

And then they heard a loud sound like a squawk echo from the inside of the

 Bo's eyes flared up when the sound turned into a growl.
 They exchanged worried looks and were almost ready to do something stupid

Mr.

More advice, Wince? It doesn't always work, I'm afraid,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and didn't bother to look at the halfuin.
 Winceham realised Ned was probably still blaming mostly him for what happened
 at the Sniggering Pig.
 He'd try and talk it out of him, if he didn't know Ned all too well.
 He simply changed the subject:

Any sign of them yet? Where's the bleedin' sun when you need it? What time
 is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked and his eyes froze when he saw the bunny turn his head around
 at an impossible angle, grin at him and hold up a flaming hourglass with
 his hind legs, writhing with molten fire.
 It showed the day was well into the afternoon.

\begin_layout Standard

 said Theo, looking at the clouds as if he could make out the sun behind

 No-one but Winceham had noticed Bo's antics, or if they had, they didn't
 look surprised.
 Winceham thought as much and asked flatly:

 Theo stared for a moment and nodded fervently:

Parcifal was fidgeting uncomfortably inside their make-shift, make-believe

 Parcifal simply spoke them aloud instead of holding them within:

Ned was busy searching for the men who had disembarked from the flying ship.
 He had seen a couple of them, along with an ape-man, and what must've been
 the Hound Fingammon had heard mention of.
 Still, as they waded through the bush, approaching Hobb's search party
 with care, he once more explained to the noble princess why she and her
 sister, the Queen by right, were wearing a large bear-skin covering up
 their gear, pretending to be a two-headed freak:
\end_layout

It's the gear.

 Lernea talked with an impossibly sticky voice reminiscent of what dying

No other place to stick him, sorry.

I get better ideas when nature calls,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal as she tried to walk in step with the others occupying the
 same skin, meeting with stumbling success.
 Winceham's voice came muffled from under the bearskin, and in direct opposition
 to the sisters on either side of him, sounded positively delighted with
 Ned's idea about diversionary tactics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't see a bloody thing in front of me, but I know where to put me hands

 Lernea protested:
\end_layout

That was a sexual innuendo if I've ever heard one! Shameful, Mr.

 Parcifal exchanged a look with her sister and put her boot down hard on
 Winceham's right foot, while Lernea caught his left arm and dragged him
 along while he hopped on one foot.

Hanultheofodor, though Hanul or Theo will do just fine,

I'm sorry, but by monsters in that context, I was referring to the water

The Hound,

 he said with a feeling of awe and mounting anger as his eyes could not
 peel away from the three-headed canine, abnormally large, its skin sleek-black
 like the darkest of nights.
 A hundred feet or so behind the pirate search party, the silhouette of
 the ship bobbed lazily in the air, nearly the same height as the treetops.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alright,

 said Ned with conviction.

\begin_layout Standard

 the taught bearskin that covered all three of them like an over-sized coat.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Try to clap along the sound of my beat.
 When I stop the drumming and singing, have a go at them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned and started off with a drum roll, his red drum strapped in place
 in front of him, his tinglewood sticks a gift from his father.
 His voice echoed merrily as he sung at the top of his lungs, alongside
 the perky beat of his drum:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
And it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's men heard them before they could see them.
 One of the Hound's head's sniffed the air vigorously, while another turned
 and looked sideways at Ned and the others as they tried to dance about
 to the tune, the sisters and Winceham having a real problem standing upright
 while their dance looked more like a drunken balancing act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ape-men grinned broadly at the spectacle, while the buccaneers had the
 uneasy expression of someone meeting an odd, crazy-looking person on his
 doorstep asking to use the facilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned kept at the song as they got closer at a walking pace, and Theo performed
 a sort of light show, sprinkling shiny dust in the air.
 Even Bo added his flaming eyes to the performance, hopping eagerly.

Ned exchanged looks sideways with Theo.
 The ape-men where clapping their hands and jiggling their heads in tune
 with the beat of Ned's drum, while the buccaneer men pointed a couple of
 fingers and shot some ugly stares at the two-headed freak.
 They were in fact arguing whether or not the six-legged weirdo was supposed
 to be the dancing lead, seeing that the drummer and the clown were busy
 with their own act.
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the Hound had its six eyes all set on Bo; the
 beast looked tense, its lean muscles taut on edge.
 They were now no more than ten yards away, and Ned was banging away a joyous
 beat, his voice like hearty laughter through the air:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
The two-headed freak, the sisters and Winceham in disguise really, tried
 to clap its hands together on tune but rarely managed to do so.
 It rather seemed to punch its belly vigorously, both heads smiling brightly
 as it did so.
 Winceham's muffled agony at the hands of the sisters was obfuscated by
 Ned's singing and drum act, while Theo's cantrips had even attracted the
 gaze of the wary buccaneers who were tapping their boots in tune as well.
 The ape-men had put down their blunderbusses and were dancing, arm-in-arm,
 in a rather hairy, unpleasing sight.
 The Hound though kept trained at Bo who was happily doing somersaults in
 the air; a flaming rainbow of orange light trailed his eyes.
 Ned and the rest entered into a circle around the group of Hobb's men,
 and into the final verse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I'm sick in the head and I haven't gone to bed

\begin_layout Standard
Ned' voice trailed off and he ventured a somewhat nervous look at Theo.
 The ape-men staggered as the banging of the drum stopped, and one of the
 buccaneers asked showing a set of teeth that looked like a puzzle badly
 missing most of its pieces:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 came Winceham's muffled cry from within the belly of the two-headed freak

The sisters shed the bearskin in one fluid motion, revealing their armor
 and weapons underneath with Winceham in the middle, holding a rather pointy
 dagger in one hand and sporting a wild-eyed grin.
 Theo side-stepped Ned and passed him the crossbow he kept tucked under
 his robes.
 Hobb's men were fiddling with the flintlocks on their guns, gnarled looks
 of surprise on their weather-torn faces; their dropped jaws denoted dental
 hygiene was probably a pirate's worst fear.
 One of the ape-men had time enough to ask their pirate handlers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is this part o' the troupe's act?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the brighter of the two had the chance to explain, Ned's bolt had
 buried itself in his head.
 The other ape-man looked at Ned with a cocked eyebrow and complained even
 as his hand reached for the cutlass at his cloth belt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's not entertaining, at all.

How's this then!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Winceham and with a jolt and a rolling tumble right beside the
 pirates, reached under the large ape as he was about to have a go at Ned
 and Theo.
 Winceham gave the ape-man a quick stab in one leg; blood spurted and the
 large brute growled in pain as his animal self took over.
 The pirates were only a pace away from the sisters; free of the constraining
 bearskin, they truly seemed to dance to an inner beat.
 The pirates' blunderbusses let off their leaden shots from point-blank
 range with a thundering boom and a plume of smoke and sparks.

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters were nowhere to be seen.

Oy, these 'basses work bettah when loaded with sumetin', eh?

 said Mr.

 When he gave him a look though, he became morbidly aware that the man's
 head had been chopped off clean.
 A few feet away stood Parcifal wielding Encelados in her hand, grinning
 at the pirate broadly.
 A few feet behind him, Lernea showed off her skills with the bow.

 she cried and let loose a fistful of arrows headed for the ape-man from
 a distance a blind man would rarely miss.
 Sadly though, they zipped by harmlessly and the growling ape charged at
 Theo with his cutlass swinging down from way up high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do something Theo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Ned as he struggled to reload his crossbow, his drum getting in the
 way.
 It was all happening in fractions of a moment; Theo laid there helpless,
 his hands unable to produce anything other than a trembling motion.
 His senses had nothing good in stock for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was trying to nock another arrow, and Parcifal was exchanging blows
 with the remaining pirate.
 He could hear Winceham cursing as he rushed behind the ape once more, but
 he was far too slow.
 And Bo..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Where is Bo?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought flashed in Theo's mind as he lay there practically paralyzed.
 His vision then filled with the image of a white fluffy rabbit smiling
 at him in an uncanny human fashion; Bo leapt in the air, swung his head
 around, and shot a pair of small fireballs at the charging ape, who was
 instantly engulfed in flames.
 His body came down crashing, writhing in flames, while Theo saw the Hound
 hurtle past him, ignoring him completely as it was after Bo at a running
 pace that its size belied.
 Its three heads shot cones of fire, lightning and acid as it ran after
 Bo, charring the ground, making plant life in its path fizz away into goo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo shouted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 with pained affection and worry and ran after the hound heedless of the
 danger.
 Winceham stuck his dagger into the charred remains of the ape-man with
 a wild cheer, while Encelados' clangs came to an end when Parcifal expertly
 nicked his cutlass away from him and brought her blade against his bare
 neck.

 said Lernea and her bow shuddered as an arrow flew away.
 It struck the Hound at one of its necks, and caused it to give pause to
 the chase.
 The head where the arrow had struck soon fell limp as it died - the other
 two ventured to pierce the very clouds with their howls and growls.
 The hound turned about and charged straight at Lernea.
 Running past a bewildered Theo, the Hound swerved around one of Ned's bolts
 and shot him a glancing shot of deadly acid breath.
 Fortunately his drum got in the way, and promptly began to melt away.

 cried Lernea to Parcifal as she nocked a second arrow in her bow.
 The Hound was closing in damnably fast; a shot of acid went wide of its
 mark, while a bolt of lightning knocked Winceham off his feet and threw
 him down with a thud that didn't match the halfuin's size.
 Ned was reloading his crossbow, while Theo was still running after Bo,
 nearly lost behind some trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the hound's heads growled ferociously and prepared to leap at Lernea,
 only a few yards separated them.
 It was Parcifal who slided on her knees suddenly in front of the hound,
 hunched behind the family shield, Erymanthos.
 The Hound clashed on the shield with all its might and a terrible raucous;
 Parcifal was knocked away wildly, while the Hound bucked and leapt on the
 air without any control, rolling haplessly.
 As it fell down on the earth only a few feet away from Lernea, it was still
 trying to stand on its feet when two arrows struck true right between its
 heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without so much as a squeak, it passed away.
 It's death cry was replaced by a cannon shot like thunderclap flaring hot
 as it flew right above everyone's heads; the red-hot cannonball cut down
 a swath of trees with a pompous thud and a loud mass of creaking noises.
 Winceham mumbled obscenities between deep moaning sounds while Ned caught
 a man reloading a cannon from the corner of his eye.
 He turned around and looked; it was Culliper.
 Ned overflowed with rage suddenly:

\begin_layout Standard

 Lernea nodded and picked up the shield as she went.

The cannon on the prow of the ship was manned by Culliper alone.
 With the element of surprise gone, he yelled menacingly:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then fired both his pistols, one aimed at Ned and the other at Lernea.
 Ned was running with the speed and grace of the wind; Culliper simply was
 too slow to aim and the bullet meant for Ned zipped past him, blowing chunks
 of wet-wood out of a nearby tree.
 But the other bullet struck Lernea true with an ominous metal clang, and
 felled her to the ground.

 run towards the ship once more, her hair ruffled up.

 yelled Culliper with a fist and started reloading his pistols mumbling
 curses under his breath with a jittery voice.
 The smell of something burning drew his attention and then noticed the
 intensity of the smell.
 Combined with a burning sensation, it made him realise his hat was on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He threw it on the deck panicked, and stomped on it repeatedly.
 He then realised a bunny with flaming eyes was grinning at him, perched
 on top of a barrel of highly flammable grog.

Now lookit here, a bunny with flaming eyes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper cocked the flintlock but before he could pull the trigger, a fist
 connected sharply with his face and sent his head spinning and him staggering
 like a pirate with coin to spend.
 Before he had time to recover, another punch sent him sprawling on the
 deck.
 It was Ned, trembling with hate as the man who killed his father laid helpless
 before him, his pistols lying about far corners of the deck.
 He looked at him with a viciousness that marred his benign face:

No, Ned, wait! Don't!

 said Lernea as she climbed onto the deck.
 She still held Erymanthos, its upper lip torn and a large sunken hole prominent
 near the Nomos crest of the Holy Mountain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper looked at them with surprise and stubbornness mixed in equal parts.
 For a passing moment, Culliper thought about upstaging everyone with a
 feat of nimbleness and pick up his pistols, shooting the meddling pests
 dead.
 But his pragmatism and his basic cowardice overcame him.
 Laying on his back he begged for his life:

No, please! Listen to her...
 Ned! If I heard her right, that is.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

Ned picked up a loaded pistol nonetheless and aimed it squarely at Culliper.
 He then told Lernea with pain in his voice, the pistol in his hand trembling
 with frail determination:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me a really good reason not to pull this trigger, Queen of Nomos.
 I'd expect you'd understand.
 Or would you have me adhere to the sanctity of life, even the life of a
 maggot, like this one? Will this scar me for life? I'm already scarred,
 Lernea.
 Nothing good will come of this, you might say.
 I care for naught.
 It's him, and Hobb.
 This one pulled the trigger; Hobb was the one who sucked my father's life
 out of him.
 So tell me, good Queen, one good reason not to.

Lernea looked long and hard at Ned; her stare had a calming effect.
 She sighed and said carefully:

 of the way the others, and especially Winceham, stared at her sister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her efforts to reprimand Parcifal were for naught; she still munched away
 blissfully even after everyone had filled their bellies thoroughly.
 She had gathered a small cornucopia in front of her, including a leg of
 smoked ham, a head of almost-gone-bad cheese and all sorts of sweetbreads
 and sour pancakes, along with a bulging fruit-basket and an amphora of
 sweet red wine.
 The ship's galley had been recently stocked to the brim, as if in preparation
 for a long journey.

 Winceham counterpointed, waving a finger as he spoke:

Ned sighed.
 He knew Winceham tended to be overprotective, mostly of himself:

Halfuin skin is very sensitive; it could be months before I'm fit for action

 said Ned nodding at Culliper at the helm, and walked away towards the ship's
 bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham nodded and his gaze returned to the horizon.
 There was still nothing in sight that resembled Hobb's Keep or Chuck's
 Point, the northern cape's ridge where the keep stood.
 Below the ship, which was an otherwise unassuming, common pirate sloop
 that could nonetheless literally fly, a hazy tapestry of green passed them
 by in tranquility.
 To port, one could barely make out Hobb's Bay in the distance, while to
 starboard a sea of rolling jungle hills seemed to go on forever.
 And behind them, somewhere beyond the haze and the fog stood the remains
 of the woodkin village, where Fingammon prayed to Jah, waiting for his
 peoples' safe return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo kept a wary eye on Culliper who remained unequivocally silent, nursing
 the aching back of his head from time, shooting murderous stares at everyone
 once in a while.
 Everyone except Bo who stood watch high upon the mast.
 The bunny, for some reason known only to the two of them, made Culliper
 cringe and look away with a morose, even shameful expression.

Parcifal made it common knowledge that she felt full with a loud burp, followed

 asked Theo, who had left Culliper in the care of Bo.
 That roughly meant that Bo slept soundly while Culliper stood on the helm,
 rigid like stone, yet fretful like a virgin on her wedding night.

Lernea felt the woodkin was perhaps intruding, his question a bit too straightfo

 Parcifal did not seem to share in that thought and said with a playful
 grin, her brow raised:

 It was evident in his voice that the thought of time stopping and perhaps

 Everyone turned their heads to have a look-see while the neck of the ridge
 kept growing taller.
 Even Mr.
 Jessums moved his dead-like stare a bit, still strapped down on the strange-loo
king contraption on the lower part of the deck that resembled a chair.
 Arguably, it was a most sinister chair that according to Culliper, sucked
 the life force of its occupant in order for the ship to fly.
 Winceham had called the premise `a hay bag full of excrement' but his own
 personal experience of sitting on it caused him to squirm away at the sight
 of it the moment they managed to pull him off.

 At the very tip of the cape, it was a huge oblong stone and brick construct,
 it's wide walls situated to cover with their cannon and balistae both Hobb's

 It rose formidably above the clouds.
 Ned waved everyone close and they huddled together in a rough circle:

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and flexed his fingers.
 Everyone else readied their weapons as well and hunched low to the sides
 of the ship.
 At the tower, an elevated wooden platform stood out, acting as a dock.
 It was supported on a wheeled scaffold which sported some kind of pulley
 arrangement.
 The whole dock seemed able to move, elevate and rotate with the help of
 some ropes and weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lookout had seen the ship approach; he was standing on the platform scratching
 his head.
 He rearranged his hat and squinted his eyes.
 A scruffy-looking dog was barking non-stop.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ahoy there! What took yer so long? Why's everyone shy? Jessums? Is Scubbs
 acting like the fool again? It ain't no ghost ship this time, I can tell!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled the pirate and fell into a death-defying giggle that involved clearing
 up one's lungs and nose cavities thoroughly.
 He spat a greenish globule, the color of grog and the consistency of glue.
 Even the dog cared enough to move, flee-bitten and ridden with lice as
 it was.
 No answer came and Ned simply let the ship slide effortlessly sideways,
 the platform grazing the hull slightly:

Och! Watch the paint, you dumb rum-sacked lolly-gagging halakazoo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rope seemed to shoot off itself down to the tower and Ned appeared suddenly
 and stepped on the platform, his crossbow in hand, aimed squarely at the
 pirate.
 Lernea followed suit and nocked an arrow in her bow, while Parcifal simply
 unsheathed Encelados.
 The pirate was superbly equipped to deal with the situation at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oy, I yield,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said in a flat monotone and raised his arms, while the dog beside him

 had ever produced.

 replied Parcifal while Lernea eased her bow only slightly and followed
 her sister to an open staircase that led below.

Winceham felt it was high time he asked someone before everyone was caught
 up in doing something serious:

Seemingly out of nowhere, a burst of flame ignited the pipe in his hand

 Winceham turned around and saw Bo peeking out of Theo's robes, grinning

Winceham and Ned had been silently climbing down the many stories of the
 keep.
 Winceham could be perfectly silent when he needed to; he scouted ahead
 and made sure the way was clear before Ned followed in his steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was for the most part, an easy way in.
 There wasn't such a thing as patrols, but rather bands of merry pirates
 with a lot of time on their hands and little to do other than participate
 in pissing and drinking contests, though not necessarily in that exact
 order.
 A few rooms had pirates in the guise of guards posted outside who instead
 of actually guarding them, played craps, cards, and other gambling games,
 usually with very lopsided results that ended in sharp instruments being
 used to clarify things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, Winceham listened, watched and waited, before Ned followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They hadn't ran onto anything especially interesting or dangerous; there
 was a vague hope the woodkin would be held in the dungeons deep below,
 but other than that the complete lack of noisy conundrums above meant that
 the sisters were either brilliantly successful in their task, or in grave
 danger.
 Winceham expressed that belief with a whisper, and Ned replied with almost
 a hiss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Maybe they're waiting.

For what? Dinnertime?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Winceham, his face screwed up in anger.
 He was about to take another step forward and lead them another floor down
 when he heard a duo of pirates conversing casually as they came down a
 corridor to meet the staircase:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oy, how do we go about that then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said one, scratching his head under his hat, evidently befuddled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, I suppose we ditch them in the pit and let the crocs do the rest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied the other with a shrug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, you see I was wondering, how do we push them inside the pit.
 I mean, there's like more than just two of them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 insisted the somewhat not-so-bright-as-his colleague pirate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Boyo, you're right! How 'bout we kill'em first so they don't move about

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the other with mock surprise and excitement which did not carry over
 as intended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Dunno 'bout that, boss said feed them to crocs alive or it spoils their

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 came the wavering answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he won't know the difference know, will he?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the other with a mischievous grin that could've been sparkling had
 more teeth been available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham nodded to Ned and then casually appeared in front of them from
 behind the staircase wall:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it with you pirates and dental hygiene?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked with a cocky grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it one of them? What's it doin' down 'ere?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the pirate uneasily, while the other turned and replied with a frown
 of uncertainty:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, too short, not blue enough.
 Oy, boyo, stick'em!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the pirate and brandished a cutlass.
 To his surprise though, Winceham wasn't standing where he was supposed
 to be.
 Instead, the pirate now faced Ned's crossbow, and his rather dull partner
 had a stiletto sticking out of his gut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin, if you please?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and waved his bloodied stiletto menacingly.
 Ned kept the crossbow trained at the now glum-looking pirate, who had to
 ask:

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The pirate still didn't seem to cooperate.

That's going too far even for the likes of you, sirrah,

 said Winceham with a snarl and felt a sudden urge to stab the pirate vehemently.
 Ned stayed his arm and asked the pirate:

 asked Winceham urgently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked the pirate with an ever more frightened, bewildered voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Please, Ned.
 Let me,

 said Winceham, his voice trembling from aggravation, an ill-tempered gleam
 in his eye, the stiletto swinging in his hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The jungle folk.
 Where are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned as calmly as possible.

Oh, them you mean? Off-world with the last shipment!

Off-world?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Then they heard a cry echo down the walls.
 And then another.
 They were high-pitched and sounded familiar.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A woman's cries,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham under his breath and instinctively looked up, from where
 the sound came.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The sisters!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 yelled Ned and ran up the staircase as if the world was about to end.

Winceham told the pirate:
\end_layout

Duck.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked the pirate with a screwed up face, unable to understand.
 Winceham sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never mind, too tall anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and tripped the pirate, sending him careening down the stairs.
 Sounds of broken bones and muffled cries echoed, while Winceham ran up
 the staircase as fast as any halfuin could.

They ran up the stairs and down corridors meeting little resistance.
 A couple of unlucky pirates who wanted to see what the commotion of running
 feet was all about, met a deadly, painful fate in the form of a bolt between
 the eyes and a stiletto in the nether regions.
 Not so silent but rather deadly, Ned and Winceham searched for the sisters,
 like a wild swirling dervish would dance about a desert of stone.
 The keep was almost empty, it suddenly occurred to them.
 And the sisters were nowhere to be found, or seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until they heard a different voice, in a very different way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The top of the tower, if you please.

Did you hear that?

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm trying to quit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He then realised that Ned had heard it as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Top of the tower?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham to make sure they were hearing the same voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Speaking in our minds? What devilry is this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned in disbelief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm not sure, but it could be a trap,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham nodding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What choice is there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a shrug.
 Winceham added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

True, but I felt compelled to say that, just to make my point when things
 go horribly wrong.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned placed a hand on Winceham's good shoulder and told him with ardor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hurry, Wince.
 Be on your toes; try to hide yourself in the shadows up there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Believe me when I say that would have been my first choice as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them ran up the tower expecting some kind of surprise on the
 way, but nothing obstructed them.
 Soon, they emerged at the tower's top, the night sky glistening with starlight,
 the clouds below a soft, tempting, milky white mattress.
 They noticed alarmingly that the ship was missing, along with any signs
 of Theo and Bo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What really caught their eye though, was the way the sisters stood, not
 far away from the tower's edge right in front of the staircase.
 They were frozen like statues, the intensity of their plight drawn on their
 living faces.
 They looked as if a last, stilted breathe remained in them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood with Encelados blaring white hot above her head, both hands
 on the hilt, her face scrounged up in a mix of terror and hate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was right beside her, calm like the sea, determined and unyielding
 as she was about to let an arrow fly; yet the bow's string remained taut,
 and Lernea stood there as if petrified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right behind the sisters stood an extremely tall, lavishly robed man with
 a beard, ruffled hair and a sharp, too sharp too be real, icy blue gleam
 on his eyes.
 Winceham tried to meld into the shadows, taking small back-steps to the
 nearest ledge of the tower, his hood over his head.
 The bearded man spoke then with a rolling, deep voice that sounded like
 stony reeds alongside a foaming river:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Now, now, Mr.

Hobb,

 stated Ned coldly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, yes.
 Among others,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the man, the torch in his hand casting wild, creepy shadows of the
 two sisters as he silently and uncannily walked between them.
 Winceham noticed an unsettling thing about him: He wasn't actually walking;
 he was gliding a couple of inches above the stone floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hold you responsible for my father's death,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and glared at him, heedless of how peculiar the man's voice and
 looks were, apart from the fact he was levitating.
 Hobb came to a stop a few yards away and smiled thinly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Weird things, humans.
 You blame me for your father's death, while Culliper pulled that trigger.
 Still, you couldn't kill him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How do you know that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned with uneasy suspicion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I know many things.
 But what I crave right now is one: the amulet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's voice had a deadly finality to it.
 It took great composure and strength of character for a man to simply talk
 with that man around, yet Ned found in him the audacity to talk back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not a jeweler; you have the wrong person.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's face suddenly got screwed up horribly and stretched impossibly.
 With another twist of its flesh and a growling, the human face was torn
 away, evaporating instantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its place, an elongated head was now visible.
 Grey-blue skin shone slick in the starlight and a flock of stubby, short
 tentacles like anemones writhed around a circular, sharp-teethed maw.
 The hands had turned into webbed claws, sharp like scythes.
 Hobb, it turned out, was literally some kind of monster out of a nightmare.
 The creature that had disguised itself as Hobb looked at Ned with an irritated
 curiosity and blared ominously, its voice now grating:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't play coy with me! I know about your little escapades, and I've seen

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's a really ugly way to ask for things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned, while he noticed Winceham stood silent and immobile as a rock.
 Ned realised he was suddenly a little bit outmatched but carried on, trying
 to understand the foe in front of him and think of what to do next, really
 really fast.
 The creature approached him with unnerving silence and stood hovering in
 the air a few feet away.
 Its blue-on-blue eyes had the colour of the deepest sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 replied the monster with a rumbling voice.

\begin_layout Standard

Yes, I see mopping really is beneath you,

 said Ned grinning, gesturing at the tentacled maw.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was hoping I did not have to feed tonight; your minds sicken me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the creature said and hissed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I could say the same thing about your face but that would be a compliment
 in your case,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ned, and saw Lernea's hand spasm ever so slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll have what is mine, Ned Larkin, and you'll have what you deserve!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the monster as he lunged forward with a gaping maw, aiming squarely
 for Ned's head, its powerful long arms springing to catch Ned in a deathly
 embrace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was right at that time that Lernea's arrow struck him in the back,
 causing it to turn around reflexively and growl, its maw tentacles writhing
 like the feet of a millipede.
 Ned slid away and ran towards the wheeled platform where the ship had docked.
 From the corner of his eye, he saw Lernea was trying to move and Parcifal's
 hands were trembling.
 Winceham too, could move his head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will find great delight in sucking your skull dry, Larkin!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the creature as it hurled himself against Ned, its robes fluttering
 in the night breeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With your sense of humor, that's a no-brainer!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled Ned gleefully and saw Lernea, Parcifal and Winceham suddenly unfreeze
 completely.
 Without a second look at their surroundings, their weapons were being trained
 against the creature.
 Their angered shouts and brave cries rose into the night air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skarla, we'll have vengeance!

 yelled the sisters, and Winceham asked before rushing towards the blue-skinned
 terror:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ya think you're tall, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a wave of its hand and a low-keyed hum from its maw, all three of them
 were pushed back in the air.
 They landed hard on their backs, their weapons flying off their hands.
 The monster turned its attention squarely at Ned, before it added gleefully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where is the humor now, human?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The last word had the subtle hints of sounding exactly like a writhing mass

 Ned smiled coolly and retorted:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You just keep asking yourself, don't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The creature let out a terrible sound between an infuriated growl and a
 cacophonous gurgling laughter before it reached for Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right when there was nothing funny to joke about, right about when Ned could
 see the others were still trying to get up, too far away to act, he saw
 Bo, the bunny with the flaming eyes jump right in front of him.
 Bo grinned at Ned widely and hopped back out of view in a split second,
 right before a hot molten cannonball hit the monster square across the
 face and embedded what was left of him and his smoldering robes in the
 tower's stony floor, a few feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then saw the ship wobbling uncertainly, sails rippling with small gusts
 of wind.
 Theo hurried to man the helm, while the bow cannon cooled with a red after-glow
 on its lip.
 A thin wisp of smoke wafted westward, where the wind blew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled broadly and sighed with relief, while Winceham yelled as he looked
 around him, waiting for confirmation:

Did ya see it? Did ya see the bunny?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters got up on their feet, nursing aching muscles and perhaps a couple
 of displaced bones.
 Lernea was about to say something to Winceham, but she lost her words when
 she saw a bright flash and an uncanny oval slit appear right above the
 tower floor in mid-air, at the place where the creature should have met
 its demise.

The slit made things look as if peering through a strange, stained looking
 glass, all broken and uneven.
 It was like someone had pieced together parts of another night sky; as
 if another place lay beyond that oval slit.
 The monster was limping heavily; it glanced at Ned and said nothing.
 Its eyes flashed suddenly, before it crossed into the oval slit, which
 then disappeared as strangely and abruptly as it had appeared.

Ned stood there unable to really understand what had happened.
 So did the others, apart from Theo who, seemingly unfazed, settled the
 sloop near the platform a bit awkwardly.
 He jumped off the ship and quickly tied her down to the tower with a mooring
 line.
 He sounded awfully excited when he rushed over by Ned's side.

Well, that pirate was making weird noises like the ones people do when they
 die and Bo seemed really worried when the ship began to wobble real bad.
 He kind of insisted that I placed my amulet in this weird slot in that
 awful chair, and then all the wobbling stopped.
 But the pirate died,

 answered Theo truthfully, his voice trailing off with sadness.

No, I mean, where were you when all this happened?

Oh, I heard this weird voice in my head and it felt all wrong; I was in
 the ship, where you told me to stay.
 But for some reason, Bo was already gnawing on that rope we had tied and
 before I could convince him otherwise, the ship had drifted away.
 So I thought I'd give her a spin,

 said Theo excitedly and added thoughtfully:

You did say I should keep an eye on her, didn't you?

Yes I did.
 I'm not sure though what would have happened if I hadn't.
 Or just what kind of a bunny Bo is, really,

 said Ned, ponderously gazing at Bo who was happily tucked away again inside
 Theo's robes, his face barely protruding, his nose twitching as if he was
 about to sneeze.

Well what about that? You might be actually funny, lad.
 I think it saved our lives, to be honest.
 I couldn't flutter an eyelid, but everything you said, it just cracked
 me up for no reason! And then I could move again!

 said Winceham as he nourished a bruised elbow, grinning as he approached
 Ned and Theo.
 The sisters followed close behind, bickering about which one's fault some
 thing, or the other, really was.

 Lernea accused Parcifal.
 The younger by one minute sister, replied in aggravated tones:

Me? You were the one who said to go have a look! Your decision, your responsibil

 yelled Lernea, right about when Theo saw Culliper untying the rope that
 held the ship moored to the tower.

He's trying to get away!

 cried Theo and began to twirl his hands in the air for no apparent reason.

You didn't tie him down?!

 asked Ned in wild-eyed disbelief.

You told me to look after the ship, not him!

 replied Theo as the air between his hands began to fill with a warm, violet
 light.

Amateurs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham softly and picked up a loose cobblestone.
 He closed one eye and aimed at Culliper, just as he was about to start
 running back to the ship.
 Winceham threw the stone expertly and it connected with Culliper's head
 at a very accident-prone spot; the back of his head.
 Culliper staggered for a couple of steps, before collapsing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The violet light between Theo's hands died down softly; he and Ned walked
 over to where Culliper lay.
 He wasn't exactly unconscious, but he looked painfully disoriented.
 His face sported a furrowed grin, quite suitable for someone possibly brain
 damaged.
 Ned caught him by the nape of his jacket and told him more so, than asked
 him:

 asked Ned and Culliper simply pointed up in the sky.
 Ned asked again, his voice giving off signals he wasn't in the mood for
 jokes.

I'm not in the mood.

 Theo asked rather calmly:

 platform.

Flying to the stars, to a place called Tallyflop, to save the woodkin and

 said Ned, quietly gazing at the starry night sky.
 Winceham caught a glimpse of everyone contemplating this seriously, and
 after a moment or so of thinking, said with a sigh:
