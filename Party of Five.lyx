\begin_layout Section*
Part One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was standing at the docks, watching the good ship Autania as it
 gracefully waded through the peaceful water of Hobb's Bay; the wind was
 on her stern, her sails full.
 She was making good speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hope the damn thing sinks and they all drown,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a scowl on her face.
 Behind her, the harbor was settling into its nightly rhythm.
 Rowdy sailors were looking for the next tavern in line to get drunk and
 have a brawl, the traders were finishing up their business with shady-looking
 characters and the fishermen were making ready for the break of dawn and
 the next catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was sitting right beside her on the stony pier, her naked feet dangling
 in the water.
 She asked Parcifal with had a sad look on her face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does that mean we can't go back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, we can't go back Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a sigh and a shake of her head, her piercing gaze
 stuck somewhere beyond the rosy-red horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with raised eyebrows.
 She noticed Parcifal's strange, angry look and knew it wasn't the right
 thing to do but asked her anyway:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not ever?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head slowly around and gave Lernea a stabbing look before
 answering coldly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not as long as the Jangdrivals are in power and the Unseen Council remains
 in place, not while the Eleven Pillars stand and the Noble Eagles fly above
 the Skarlas, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea put a finger on her lip and with a puzzled frown asked again: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that never, or really just a long time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You vex me, sister.
 Never means never.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, didn't master Sisyphus always say, `never say never'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with a hesitant smile creeping up on her lip.
 Parcifal's visage turned suddenly sorrowful, like a noble, sleek and gray
 statue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Master Sisyphus is dead, Lernea.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That doesn't mean he was wrong, though.
 Never is such a final word, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and stood up on her toes, her hands on her waist.
 She faced her sister with a bright smile full of optimism which she did
 not share.
 In fact, Parcifal's sadness turned into barely suppressed anger at Lernea's
 persistence to face their new reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get it right in that little thick skull of yours, Lernea.
 We, are, never, going, back, to, Nomos.
 Never!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, a lone finger rapping at Lernea's breastplate with an audible
 clang on the beat of every word.
 Lernea's eyes wandered to her chest for a moment, before her face reddened
 and her breathing became more pronounced, her nostrils flaring up.
 She pouted her lips and said icily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I think I'll just do what I please from now on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal.
 Her face had the look of a poised hawk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate it when you do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea in the same vein, shaking her head slowly with mounting irritation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know, that's why I do it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're such a child.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Says the one who can't accept defeat!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's loud tone made a few heads turn and look.
 Lernea did not even notice they were attracting the attention of the locals,
 and added her own shouts to the rising din of their heated debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This isn't about winning or losing, by Skrala! You can't be that daft!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're the one that got us into this mess in the first place, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with arms crossed on her chest.
 Lernea flailed her arms wildly around her while moving about nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, really now that's just so typical, trying to put the blame on me like
 we're still meddling with the master's spellbook!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well I'm not the one who married Therion Jangdrival on a whim and got us
 exiled!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Parcifal with open arms and a mocking smile.
 Lernea's reply was filled with overtones of shock and disgust, her face
 scrounged up, her revulsion showing in every word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was him or Gheighran! Have you even seen Gheighran? He's a walking swamp-thin
g, not a man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal shook her head and berated her slightly older sister, her face
 suddenly grim and her voice low-keyed and even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that how you make decisions about your kingdom, my Queen? Based on looks
 and appearances? Only if mother were alive..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let her voice trail off and ventured a look towards the ocean.
 The Autania's sail was barely visible, the light of day growing dimmer
 with every passing minute.
 Lernea was looking at her feet, feeling scolded and reprimanded like a
 child.
 Yet, when she talked next she had the voice of a proud woman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mother made mistakes as well in her reign.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, she did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal nodding and went on to shout, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She gave birth to you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're only a minute apart, you stupid-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stopped in mid-sentence even as her mouth began to form the word
 `cow'.
 She had instinctively flung her arm and was grabbing at what seemed to
 be a child's arm, the arm extending into a hand holding her coinpurse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and turned to look almost right behind her.
 There was a short person standing there, all dressed up in dark leather
 and an impossibly blant, expressionless face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal took out a silver, teardrop-shaped knife and took a step towards
 her sister's side where the form of a short person stood frozen, said person
 pretending he was nothing more than a misplaced piece of furniture.
 He seemed to be holding his breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A thieving scum, and a bad one at that, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the short person with a whizz.
 Out of breath, he looked sideways at the bristling knifepoint and suddenly
 sucked on air through his nostrils loudly.
 His body relaxed and he let the bulging coinpurse drop to the wooden pier
 with a heavy jingle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea made a grimace and turned her head away from the short man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see why you held that breath of yours.
 Could even kill a man; one of your stature, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed less inclined to comment on the aspiring thief's lack of
 mouth hygiene.
 She looked at him with mixed feelings of curiousity and frustration, brandishin
g her knife with accusation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barely stepped foot on this land, and here's our greeting.
 Couldn't resist our riches, little man?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal, her shiny breastplate protruding from the rest of her body
 armor very close to the thie'f face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be fair, my fair lady! Wasn't ogling your, ehm, lady parts or anything,
 your gracefulness.
 Not that they're not worth to, well, ogle,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with an awkward smile and looked up to Parcifal like a man seeking
 redemption in prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea punched him in the gut then; the short little man doubled over, his
 face flustered.
 He looked momentously suprised and awestruck, rather than simply hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She was talking about our money, our armor, our valuables! Really, to address
 any woman in such a fashion.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned and looked at her sister with a bewildered expression, squinting
 her eyes slightly, her knife still aimed at the thief's general direction
 who was trying to stand up again to his full four feet of height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all about being a queen proper, isn't it? He was addressing me, not
 you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea grinned and straightened her hair before she mused mostly to herself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You really can't get over the fact I was the first born, rightful heir to
 the throne and all that, can you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fact is you're a spoiled brat if I've ever se-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal left her sentence incomplete as she noticed the coinpurse, as well
 as the thief had simply vanished out of sight.
 She looked at the milling crowd behind them reflexively.
 In the dimming, scarce light of dusk she spotted the thief, idly walking
 about with his hands in his pockets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She ran after him with Lernea right behind.
 With little effort she nudged her way past a couple of bystanders who were
 having a smoke and grabbed the man by his cloak, lifting him up like a
 runaway child and handing him over to Lernea.
 She grabbed him with bith hands from his vest's collar.
 The sisters looked positively miffed, if not thunderous.
 The short little man exploded with indignation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do say! What manner of outrage is this now? Bellicose women running rampant
 in the streets? Is there no law, no order in this cauldron of misery and
 debauchery? Guards! Guards!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters looked at the man intently for a moment, examining him like
 some sort of exotic bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and Lernea nodded her affirmation, adding, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no mistaking that breath.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man looked at each of them with an hurtful, presumptious look and raised
 a hand before speaking, his eyes closed most of the time in a haughty manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can dispense with the insult to my dwarven heritage concerning my breath
 since as a gentleman I am aware that great allowances should be made for
 differences of custom and training.
 I can understand you are foreigners, fresh off the boat, clearly confused
 and utterly misguided as to the identity of my person.
 Although you are clear lacking proper lady-like training and manners, such
 is my gentleness and strength of character though that I am willing to
 forego any and all legal accusations and forthcoming tribulations against
 your persons, should you deposit me safely and unharmed on the ground so
 I may go about my business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head and looked at Lernea with a raised eyebrow.
 Lernea looked at her sister and nodded before upending the short man who
 claimed to be a dwarf and shaking him vigorously.
 Other than a couple of bored, curious looks, noone seemed particularly
 inclined to question what has happening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments later a rush of metallic clang was heard as various items
 fell on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aha!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea gleefully, while her sister shook her head with an uncertain
 look on her face.
 The short little man who claimed to be a dwarf and a gentleman was looking
 at the two ladies in an austere manner, even though he was hanging upside
 down, his hands crossed on his chest like some sort of human-like bat having
 a difficult time sleeping.
 His cloak brushed against the items that had fallen from his person; a
 small metallic disc with a chain, a gold, flat square tin like a cigar
 holder, and a small, thin, stiletto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal pouted her lips and made a rolling motion with her hands to Lernea,
 which went largely unnoticed.
 Lernea said with a wide grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What say you now, thief?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She made sure to intone the word thief as it meant someone oozing gritty,
 unhealthy amounts of slime from every orifice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal bulged her eyes and made frantic motions to Lernea to put the man
 down, pointing to what had fallen on the ground instead of the expected
 loot.
 Lernea finally took a look on her own and hesitantly put the short man
 on his own two feet.
 He looked at them with a most severe look that implied he could not find
 the words to begin to describe his feelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I cannot find the words to even begin to describe my feelings.
 You should be ashamed.
 I fear, I cannot in right conscience call you ladies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, dusted off his cloak, straightened his vest and pants and walked
 away briskly without another word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at him in mute disbelief, while Lernea picked up the man's
 items from the ground, spending a mere moment to examine them.
 His small figure had almost disappeared into the mass of people crowding
 the busy street when she shouted at him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir! Terribly sorry, but you forgot your things, sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal had a moment of clarity and sprang into action, running through
 the street shouting to her sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's because those aren't his either!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood motionless for moment, idly holding the stolen goods with both
 hands in her lap.
 Her lips formed a soundless circle while her eyes shone with a dazzled
 ferocity.
 Realizing they had been duped she dropped everything and ran after her
 sister and the dwarf - or perhaps a simply very short man - who kept surprising
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man shot a glance behind his back and saw the sisters were right on
 his tail, shoving and brushing people aside as they ran after him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fire! Fire! I say, fire!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted amidst the crowds in an effort to cause panic and hysteria that
 would suit his purpose of getting away.
 That did not work; the people all around him went about their business,
 a few casually wondering to themselves where the voice came from.
 He had to make himself scarce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Quick! Into that establishment!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled Parcifal to Lernea, her finger pointing to a large sign, graced
 by the presence of nearby lamplight.
 Night proper had fallen and the light posts were being lit up, one by one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Sniggering Pig? That sounds like a piss-hole!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did you expect? Come on, hurry!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal even as they left the stream of people in the street and
 saw the man who had robbed them of money and pride hustle past the tavern's
 doorway.
 Sounds of drunken merryment and folk music blasted away from the relatively
 large place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skarla, of all the places..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea mostly to herself but followed Parcifal inside being careful
 not to touch anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the Sniggering Pig, there was ample candle light from chandeliers
 on the high ceiling, as well as candles and lamps on each and every table
 where people had still not passed out.
 A heavy scent dominated the air; rye, ale and roasted meat.
 The tables were mostly full of rowdy gangs of sailors, and everyone seemed
 to be having fun when the music suddenly stopped.
 The hubbub of laughter and loud conversation filled the emptiness until
 a rather tall and lanky fellow appeared at the far end of tavern, on what
 seemed to be the stage where the band of musicians sat.
 Parcifal's eyes had the chance to search the room for a moment.
 There was no sign of the thief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blasted runt of a man,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal, this time gripping her sword's handle instead of her knife.
 Lernea corrected her with a face that implied every second in there was
 making her feel shamefully unclean: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dwarf.
 He said he was a dwarf.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as if on cue, the tall lank man who had appeared on stage cleared his
 throat loudly and bowed, only to receive a handful of drunken 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Show us yer tittays!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless he smiled professionally and went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, this place is lively, ain't it? Feels like a band of roaming Dwarves
 would love to come by.
 Hell, it's not like they're set in stone or anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, grinning widely, posing towards the crowd which hardly noticed
 anyone was talking on stage.
 The performer was having a tough crowd.
 He turned to the band and said in voice right above a whisper: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Guys..
 That was a joke,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to which the percussionist nodded with surprise and promptly made a half-hearte
d drum roll and hit a small bell.
 The sound was more like coconuts banging together.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the performer on stage, clapping his hands all by himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal, equally oblivious to the bad comedian noticed something else and
 told Lernea:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Windows just on the front.
 That door behind the barkeep is locked and barred.
 He's somewhere in here.
 He's trapped!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And us along with him.
 God, is that man heaving his insides?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea with a tremor of disgust in her voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He'll mop it up later, I'm sure.
 Just stay right here on the door.
 I'll flush him out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea let out a little laugh, more aptly like a snigger and put a hand
 to her mouth.
 Parcifal eyed her in puzzlement, her brow furrowed.
 Lernea replied with a giggly voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounded like an, uhm..
 Poop joke.
 'Flush' him out like the little, uhm, shit he is!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal closed her eyes, said nothing and sighed.
 Then she slowly started wading through the tables and the passed-out customers.
 The comedian was trying another joke, while the crowd had mysteriously
 quietened down.
 Lots of sets of eyes were now following Parcifal's slender form as she
 moved about the tavern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dwarves, eh? I remember one night, a group of them fellows walks in this
 very same place.
 One of them yells, 'Barkeep! Seven short ones', to which the barkeep replied,
 'I can see, but what can I get you?'
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The drum roll came on cue, but the laughter he was expecting was delayed
 until a man who had been standing on all fours yelled, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barkeep! Ha ha ha! I gets it! Bar-keep!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spontaneously, half the tavern erupted in fits of laughter, while the other
 half had been magnetised by Parcifal's presence.
 Even if staring at her meant her replying with a stare that could shrivel
 their scrotum and turn their eyes into tiny glass beads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lovely crowd here tonight, lovely crowd.

 Mostly humans, but hey, everyone can smell dwarves have this aversion to

There was no drum roll.
 The man on stage eyed the band and waved his hands.
 The drum roll and the bell finally came but the crowd went on drinking

 There was a voice of dissent though:

It was the thief.
 Parcifal turned her head around and saw him, pointing an accusing finger

 She drew her sword and shouted above the din of the crowd, cradling the
 heavy blade threateningly towards the thief:

Suddenly the crowd stopped everything they had been doing; the singing ceased

 The band on the other hand, much to the comedian's dismay, started to play
 a suspenseful tune, the sound of whistling pipes dominant.

Excuse me now, I'm sure there's been some kind of misunderstanding.

Balls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 they said in one voice and everyone suddenly had something that could kill,
 maim, or hurt like hell in hand, most prominently forks, knives and assorted
 cutlery.
 Parcifal stood in the midst of them all, perhaps fifty or sixty men the
 lot of them, half of them still conscious.
 She gave Lernea a look of determined despair and grasped her sword with
 both hands, ready for what seemed to be a sudden, uneven fight to the death.
 Lernea nodded to her sister without a word and loaded her bow with an arrow.
 In one fluid motion, she was already aiming at the thief's head from a
 very comfortable distance; she couldn't miss.

The thief looked at her, grinned, bowed slightly and yelled:

The crowd erupted in sudden cheers and howls, while there still was a man
 who yelled `Balls!' right before slumping down on the floor.
 The comedian got off the stage, disheartened, and headed for the bar while
 the band began to play a serene, lute ballad.
 The barkeep smiled congenially to the comedian and said,

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal and Lernea were standing amidst the merry crowd with their weapons
 at the ready, but it was evident in the way their faces were cringing that
 they were relieved, confused and mildly insulted at the same time.
 Parcifal would not leave the thief from her sight, who approached her with
 hands up in the air, making sure his palms were open.
 He was smiling thinly, looking at Encelados with a keen, respectful eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea lowered her bow and strung it behind her back.
 She walked over to her sister, being very careful not to tread on someone

 Lernea stood by her sister's side and lowered her sword before she said
 with a calm voice:

 Parcifal looked at the man as he had insulted everything holy by Skrala

 She said to her,

Parcifal couldn't believe her ears, but followed along as if in somekind

 Winceham led the way and drew their chairs, and as they sat down he made
 a motion with a hand to the bar, always smiling.
 Parcifal said as if still in a dream:

 Winceham grinned and laid back on his chair before he said:

 a broken light lamp.

 Parcifal added after another swig of ale:

You know that, didn't you? You saw us get off the boat, saw we smelled money

Wicneham nodded along, sipping at his beer, seemingly savouring every drop.

The door to the Sniggering Inn swung with an eerie creaking noise, unusually

 A large bulky man dressed in a scaly leather vest, matching boots and cornered
 hat.
 He had a heavy-looking, jagged cutlass in hand and a blind eye, glazed
 eye.

Alright, you scallywags.

 he yelled and a vile green slime on the floor.
 Beside him stood a tall, ape-like creature dressed mostly in rugs and cloth,
 all muscle and hair.
 It carried a blunderbuss as tall as a man and grinned widely, its mouth
 filled with golden teeth.
 Like a silent church bell had rung, everyone promptly picked up their hats
 and passed-out companions and left in a hurry, though the last man was
 mindful to enough to close the door behind him.
 Winceham reached and touched the sisters hands awkwardly; he had a desperate
 look on his face.

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged troubled looks.
 They shot glances at the man who had practically ordered everyone to leave
 with a less than keen eye, and then saw the worry on Winceham's face.
 There was fear, worry and anxiety written there, the sisters shared their
 lack of doubt with a simple nod.
 Ned appeared from behind the bar, holding the sisters' coinpurse, still
 full.
 His father, the barkeep, looked at the bossy man with restrained anger.

Winceham rolled his eyes wildly as a signal to the sisters.
 It went largely unnoticed since they had both turned to face what appeared
 to be nothing more than glorified debt collector.
 The ape-man had taken the coinpurse and started counting the money, even
 as Ned found it increasingly difficult to keep his temper.
 His father shook his head and bit his lip.

 He stopped after only a step when he heard the sound of metal grinding

 Parcifal had drawn her sword and was pointing it at Culliper's back.
 He slowly turned around and saw Lernea had also nocked an arrow on her
 bow, ready to draw and aim.

 to even swerve the gun their way.
 A gunshot rang clear though; Culliper was holding a pistol, smouldering
 smoke trailing off its barrel.
 Ned's father was down on the floor with a dull thud.
 Parcifal sprang at Culliper with all the might of her sword, but he parried
 expertly with his cutlass as he turned to leave.
 Lernea was reloading her bow even as Ned cried in outrage,

Culliper jumped up on a nearby table and rushed towards a window.
 Lernea's arrow caught him on the shoulder.
 He cried in agony even as Ned was rushing right behind him.
 Parcifal saw the barrel of a pistol aiming blindly towards Ned, even as
 Culliper made ready to jump through the window; she did not hesitate and
 grabbed Ned by his waist as he run.
 She brought him down right when a bullet flew over his head and turned
 part of the wooden bar into smouldering splinters.

Culliper crashed through the window and onto the street.

 Parcifal was on her knees, nurturing a hurt jaw.
 She had a bloody lip on her jaw and she was staring at Ned like a wounded

 Ned was lying with his back against the bar.
 A stream of tears had trailed his cheeks, his face flustered.
 Winceham was sitting on the same chair as before, his face planted smugly

Ned was wholly ignoring her, his face a mask of stone cold grief, tears

Lernea suddenly looked deeply disappointed, almost heartbroken as she held
 an arrow in one hand and her bow in the other, her shoulders sagged.
 She shook her head, put the arrow in her quiver and the bow across her

The sisters both turned to look at him with an even gaze.

Halfuin,

 replied Winceham and went on after he had a sip from his cup.

 said Winceham with a sneer, before he went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It would have kept Vern alive and this place going for some time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and waved a hand around.
 He picked up a small satchel from the floor and told everyone: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We've tarried too long.
 By midnight, Hobb will be scouring the Bay.
 I suggest you make yourselves scarce as well and keep a low profile.

He nodded at the two sisters and said with a dry voice: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Dump the gear as well, you two,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 before he turned to Ned and said with a weary look and a bleak voice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm sorry, Ned.
 There is no perfect plan.

To which Ned replied with a deep, rumbling hatred in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll kill his men.

 I want to see him beg for his life before I squeeze his last breath out

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had a feral look about him, a keen, proud gaze.
 It was as if he had been Ned's long lost twin, a battle-hardened warrior
 who sought revenge.
 In truth, he was still little more than the meek, aspiring bard son of
 Vern Larkin.
 And Winceham told him so, trying not to sound unkind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Lad, you've a fiery heart, I'll give you that.

Parcifal interjected with a nod of approval:

At least he is a man, red blood coursing through his veins.

Winceham's face frowned and turned to look at Parcifal with an impossible

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea approached the rest and came to stand by her sister's side with a
 regal smile painted on her face, her hands on her hips.
 She pointed a finger at Winceham as if he was a lowly subject of hers:
\end_layout

You, halfuin, you are the one who is sorely mistaken.
 You have a less than pure heart.

Winceham sighed and finished his drink in one go.
 He then told Lernea:
\end_layout

You figured all that out by yourself? And I thought, Nomos was full of stupid

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea went wide-eyed in shocked surprise.
 Before she had time to retort to the insult, Parcifal had her sword drawn,
 poised in front of Winceham's chest, ready to pierce his heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Forswear that insult! Unsay it or Encelados be your last woe!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Parcifal in a blistering voice.
 Winceham, seeing the steely tip of Encelados flash brightly even in the
 candlelight, spoke faster than perhaps ever, in one breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You do have a penchant for the dramatic, don't you? I was only making an
 effort to be sarcastic.
 Since it seems to be an idea foreign to you, I'm particularly sorry I ever
 said such a thing so as to raise your deadly ire.
 I therefore renounce my comment, recant the implication of an insult, renege
 my former statement and repudiate my previous statement regarding your
 noble persons.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal sheathed her sword and calmness returned to her face, while Lernea
 found the clarity of mind to reply properly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No need to mock us with fancy words, sir,

 she said, intoning the word `sir' with as much disdain as possible.
 She went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We know enough about sarcasm to not use it in serious matters.
 We've been trained in languages and the arts, as well as the ways of the
 sword, bow and armor.
 Such is the way of Nomos; we are not simpletons, mind you.
 We are warrior-maidens of the Mountain Garden, not simple women who would

 We demand respect and earn it our way; we obey the laws but listen to our

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea managed to awe everyone into still silence, even her sister.
 Winceham managed to nod, not terrifed but rather enchanted by Lernea's
 presence.
 The silence was broken by Ned, who took Lernea by the arm suddenly and
 spoke from heart, the words rushing freely out his mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've spoken true milady; even a fool would feel that.
 I know this then; that you and your sister are noble women, with brave,

 I'll only ask this once and in return I pledge myself into your service
 until my last breath escapes me.
 Help me avenge my father's death, miladies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked at Ned with a surprised half-smile; it seemed he was being
 utterly serious and fully aware of what such an oath entailed.
 Parcifal saw her sister's face brighten up.
 She placed her hand gently on Ned's shoulder and told him heartily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no need for that Ned.
 We are free women and our people, is a free people; we do not offer them
 a life of servitude, but one of worth fighting for.

 We are honoured that you ask this of us; we shall avenge your father's
 demise, or fall by your side.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's face was overcome by a hard, edgy smile that crept up on his lips.
 He nodded solemnly and offered his arm to Parcifal which she grasped firmly.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a set of proud eyes and said with a
 hint of admiration:

Winceham on the other hand was half the way towards the doorway of the Sniggerin

Do you even hear yourselves? I can understand Ned is upset and has little

I've known you for a thief Winceham, but not a coward.

Winceham looked suddenly tense.

 rightful indignation:

 He went on promptly as soon as Lernea nodded matter-of-factly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He does as he pleases and that is due to two things; money and power.
 Money keeps his henchmen, guards and foot soldiers happy to work and even
 die occasionally for him, as do the crews on his ships roaming the seas
 for loot and plunder.
 That same money, the money he keeps making by bleeding everyone just short
 of dry, just like Vern and the sniggering pig.
 That money bought him an Imperial Consulate and soon if word has it right,
 a place as Princeps of the Court.
 Meaning that he is goes untouched by any sort of Imperial force of justice.
 If there's still such a thing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Meaning that this Hobb you speak of, has the wealth and power that begets

 questions would serve no purpose other than driving Ned slightly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had been slowly climbing Silkcrest Hill, no more than an hour's reach
 from Hobb's Bay to the west.
 The minute after they had finished burying Ned's father, they had heard
 a rather rowdy crowd on the street, asking for them to come out and be
 hanged for the murders they had committed.
 Hobb seemed to know how to put the blame on people and rouse the rest into
 an angry mob; Ned, Winceham and the Teletha sisters were wanted for murder
 and unlawful pillaging to boot.
 Without the need to talk it over, Ned and the rest had fleeted Hobb's bay
 through alleys and backstreets onto the nearby woods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned had come up with what was now effectively their plan, which wasn't much
 as everyone had commented, but it was their best shot, not to mention their
 only and perhaps their last one as well:
\end_layout

They'd seek out the secretive Woodkin elves that some said dwelt deep in
 the jungle where death lurked in many forms: quicksand, snakes, and other
 wildlife did not discriminate.

Winceham stopped and bent over his knees; his face was a grimace, his lungs
 burning from the effort.

We can't stop now, not until we've found them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a sense of urgency.
 He sounded annoyed, but there was tiredness in his speech as well.
 The sisters nodded and Parcifal unsheathed Encelados, and buried it into
 the ground with ease.
 Lernea sat down on the ground and unclasped a bright, silver canteen from
 her belt.
 She brought it to her lips and drank, before offering it to Winceham who
 gladly downed a mouthful himself.

You can't march all through the night without some rest, Ned.
 Not us, not you, and certainly not half-man there,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Halfuin.
 Do I need to spell it out to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, Winceham managed to reply huffing and puffing.
 He shot Parcifal a weary look and sat down himself with a growl of exertion.
 He shook his head and said somewhat bitterly:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea, her words not unkind but rather playful, judging by the thin
 smile on her face.
 Her look became suddenly worried though when she noticed Ned had already
 wandered off westwards, without so much as a word, much like a stubborn
 child.
 Lernea shot Parcifal a stern look which her sister waved away.
 Parcifal shrugged, resting with her hands around Encelados hilt, the blade
 firmly in the ground.

Well he's bound to get lost or do something stupid.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham stretched and a faint popping and crackling was heard; he let out
 a sigh and fiddled with his satchel.
 After a while he was holding a small leather pouch and a small, delicate
 pipe.
 Those items instantly attracted Parcifal's attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked bluntly, cocking her head sideways as if trying to peek.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does it look like to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham without affording her even a glance, too busy filling his
 pipe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Some sort of pipe, perhaps?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Parcifal with carefully measured uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm surprised someone imparted with such a high level of intelligence would
 be so levelheaded as to ask men of lesser caliber than myself such paltry
 questions for the mere sake of conversation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and lit his pipe, drawing in the smoke deeply.
 A smile of pure joy formed on his face and he laid himself flat on the
 ground, little whisps of smoke twirling intensely wherever starlight poured
 through as they wafted upwards around his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's turned her head and looked towards her sister and Ned.
 Her eyes searched for them intently but she could barely make their shadows
 further up the hill, shrouded by the tall grass.
 They seemed to have stopped, probably talking by the way she saw her sister
 flailing her hands about her.
 She then asked Winceham with a rather peculiar voice, as if she was concerned
 someone might overhear them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could I .
 .

 Could I have a whiff of that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham sat upright slowly and opened his eyes; they were red-shot, covered
 with a slightly glazed sheen.
 He looked all-too serene and calm, his face adorned by a lopsided smile
 that verged on drooling.
 He simply passed Parcifal the pipe and nodded languidly, his eyes half-open
 as if about to yawn and fall asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal leaned toward Winceham and took the proferred pipe with one hand.
 She took a drag and held it before closing her eyes, her lip curling in
 a slight grin.
 She then blew out the smoke in the shape of small circles, before handing
 back the pipe.
 She then straightened her back and stood watchful as ever with Encelados
 always clasped in her hands, her gaze and indeed her whole face standing
 out in the night, prouder and brighter than before.
 It was a stark contrast to the way Winceham looked, as if he'd just woken
 up from a really rough night that involved all sorts of debauchery.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey..
 What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham as he looked back and forth between Parcifal and the pipe
 with an expression of amazed wonder as if something miraculously extraordinairy
 had happened right in front of his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he thought he saw a pair of trembling flames behind a nearby bush.
 He blinked and saw the flames flicker wildly, before vanishing swiftly
 with a harrowing speed.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What in all blazes? I must be having a bad trip,

 said Winceham mostly to himself and put out his pipe.
 Parcifal overheard him and commented:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not that rough of a trail.
 When my sister and I had to go through the trails of Jordenfall though..
 That was rough, I'll tell you that.
 Sheer cliffs, hundreds of feet high, slippery ice every step of the way

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Her face was cringing but her voice was a bitter sweetness.
 It was the voice of someone who reminisces better times.
 Winceham eyed her with a worried look, his brow furrowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure you're okay? Not feeling lightheaded, sleepy, giggly, silly,

 he asked her genuinely interested.
 She took a moment, shook her head and replied earnestly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No..
 Couldn't be better.
 Top notch.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was looking at her puzzled beyond understanding when his eyes bulged
 up with sudden terror.
 He saw the trembling flames from before, trailing orange light in their
 wake.
 They were attached to the head of bunny were its eye sockets should be;
 it was hopping about not further than a few feet away.
 His jaw dropped and he looked at his pipe before staring at the bunny mesmerize
d.
 The bunny paused as if it knew, stared back at Winceham and smiled unnervingly
 before hopping out of view and into some kind of burrowed hole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you see that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he exclaimed as he got up on his feet and poked Parcifal in the arm repeatedly.
 She was instantly energized; she drew Encelados out of the ground and swung
 it around her wrist expertly, poised to strike.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The bunny! Didn't you see the bunny with the flaming eyes?

 asked Winceham with an unsteady voice and pulled out a stiletto from his
 belt.
 The blade was dull, thin and long like a spike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A bunny?

 asked Parcifal with sudden coldness in her voice as she lowered Encelados

 he asked with expectation, twirling the stiletto in his hand nervously.
\end_layout

 said Parcifal with a grin.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Great, that's great.
 I'm not having a bad trip, it's just that something actually weird is going
 on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and sighed.
 He collected his thoughts for a moment before trying to convince Parcifal
 that a strange rabbit with flaming eyes was in the vicinity.
 He felt that stressing the flaming eyes bit was essential since normal
 rabbits mixed with fire can't hop, not while on a roasting spit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal, look.
 It might seem strange but there's a bunny with its eyes on fire hopping
 around us somewhere.
 And I think it knows that I know.
 We must be very careful, stay still and silent.
 I can't stress enough that it's eyes are on fire and it's not dead yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham as he scanned the area around them inch by inch, expecting
 some catch a glimpse of the strange rabbit.
 Parcifal eyed the man with a sudden sorrow and shook her head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Poor Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then as if out of nowhere, the figure of a robed, masked man appeared behind
 Parcifal and leaned respectfully towards her ear.
 The man waved his hands and fingers in an elaborate gesture and whispered
 to her in a thin, calm and gentle voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is no bunny.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was stunned into silence.
 He was thinking that perhaps he should point out that there was a strange
 man right behind Parcifal whispering to her ear, but decided to wait until
 she knew that herself, just to make sure he wasn't imagining things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal as she turned around to face the stranger with Encelados
 readied in her hand.
 She was calm yet mindful of the stranger who appear unarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No answer came.
 Instead the man simply stood there, frozen still like a statue, his hands
 clasped together as if in prayer.
 His eyes remained closed and he hardly seemed to breathe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you not answer me, stranger?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Parcifal demanded of him with mounting volume in her voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe he's right, maybe there is no bunny,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Winceham when he suddenly saw the bunny break through the ground
 from behind Parcifal.
 It stood with it's eyes locked directly onto Winceham's gaze.
 Its nose twitched and Winceham saw the flames flash wildly for a moment,
 right before an intense feeling of chillness crept up his spine and made
 the hairs on his head stand.
 And then he saw the rabbit smile mischievously, dig back in and disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was pointing to the ground in stunned silence, eyes wide open and
 his arm trembling when Parcifal said to the silent stranger:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am Parcifal Teletha, scion of Phedra Teletha and Helios, of the Teletha

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her tone was noble yet menacing.
 It was easy for someone to see she meant everyword by her thunderous stare.
 The man opened his right eye, peeked at her, closed it and simply stood
 there like before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The bunny.
 It was right behind you Parcifal, I swear.

Parcifal turned and shot Winceham an angry look.
 She added with exasperation:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't care about your delusions! What manner of person is this man who

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said pointing at the man with Encelados' tip.
 Winceham had no other option but try to sound convincing at the top of
 his lungs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham and Parcifal turned and looked at Lernea with red, flustered faces
 from all the shouting.
 She bit them back a scolding stare but what caught her eye was the strange
 man and the fact he was looking straight at her.
 She was confused for a moment and then staring back at him with all the
 nobility she could muster under the circumstances, she asked him:

Pray you, stranger, state your name and business lest we consider you unkind

The silent figure was shocked into motion, taking a sudden step away from
 everyone else, his arms extended in a purely defensive gesture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You can see me? Impossible!

 he said to Lernea, stressing the last word as if it were certainly absurd.

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged a quick look.
 Parcifal nodded affirmatively while Lernea replied with an indifferent
 shrug.
 Winceham said then in aggravation:

I beg your pardon! Bo is not a monster!

 He took off his mask and hood, and a couple of pointy ears flopped suddenly
 upright.
 He protested:

Bo is very kind and completely harmless.

Calm down now.
 What is your name, woodkin?

Ned seemed to cringe at the thought of uttering the name fully, so he simply
 offered his hand and smile thinly but reassuringly.
 The woodkin obliged him somewhat awkwardly after noticing that everyone

 As he shook hands with Ned, Lernea told him:

Take us to your leader!

They passed a series of crests and hills shrouded in ever thickening bush
 and trees.
 The tropical forest had indeed turned into a proper jungle, full of mangroves
 and palm trees, thick grub and lush flower plants blocking their way.
 `Theo', which was how the rest had chosen to call Hanultheofodor for practical
 purposes knew the terrain well enough to avoid the thicker parts, but occasiona

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their progress was just as slow as before; Parcifal had dubbed it half-man
 pace, and Winceham had insisted on at least calling it a halfuin pace for
 the sake of proper interspecies etiquette.
 He had quietened down soon afterward though when he became acutely aware
 that being so short and therefore close to the jungle bedfloor was disadvtageou
s at best, after he had stepped on a snake thicker than his arm and longer
 than imagination allowed for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snake had been easily dealt with a chop from Parcifal's blade.
 She had said that Winceham owed her one and even placed a bet that he'd
 owe her more further down the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the woodkin village still out of view, Parcifal and Theo were leading
 the way.
 Encelados was drawn in her hand should anything surprise them; she had
 balked at the idea of using her blade as a grass-cutter.
 Even Lernea admonished she had only once seen her sister so frightfully
 indignant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked silently, taking care not to step on something that could bite
 back, each one lost in thought for their own reasons.
 At length, Theo asked Parcifal:

Of course! Counterspelling an illusionist's Ethereal Trance is a remarkable
 feat for someone not versed in the art of Choujou,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and Parcifal raised an eyebrow.
 She was beginning to suspect their guide had thought he was invisible from
 some weird reason that might or might not include an unreasonable amount
 of dreamhops or fuddlegrass, just like the kind Winceham had shared with
 her.

Ah, its tradition goes back thousands of years.

 his machete.

Parcifal was suddenly intrigued at the mention of the words

 The thought came to her that perhaps Ned had been right to convince them
 to seek the Woodkin.
 If of course the rest of Theo's kin had a firm grasp of this witchcraft
 he talked about.
 Because it was her informed opinion that the young woodkin elf was a bit
 lightheaded to put it mildly.
 She had no idea what to make of his peculiar animal companion though, unless
 it were stew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo hopped in and out of the ground, the flames in his eyes lighting up the
 path ahead with a warm orange light.
 The bunny would at times pause, stoop high and shoot the party a glance
 before burrowing in the ground, only to appear a couple of minutes later
 down the path as suddenly as it had disappeared.
 But it never strayed away from Theo for too long.
 And that had got Winceham's attention.

It's just your imagination, Winceham.

Like he said, it's some condition or other.

Winceham made a gesture of acceptance with both hands and replied:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Now, I may have from time to time exaggerated concerning some of my former
 adventures especially where women were mentioned, but it was merely in

 It has its eye on me.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stopped then and took Winceham by the shoulder.
 His look was grim, his voice unusually stern and cold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I've invoked Nadragatea on you, Winceham.
 This is one tale you'll have to follow to the end, you know that.
 Don't just pretend; your life depends on this as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham looked instantly and genuinely hurt; his eyes searched Ned's face
 for the young lad he'd come to known as he had grown into as much as a
 friend as his father.
 He saw little of that boy there.
 Instead, he was looking at a strong-willed man, indeed more than the boy's
 father had ever been.

You're right laddie, I'm full of it.

Ned nodded with an understanding look.
 He motioned them to move on again even as Lernea caught up with them from
 behind, where she had been scouting from the last hilltop they had climbed.

Nothing for as far as I could see.
 Noone is on our trail.

 said Lernea, a little short on breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You don't know what to expect with Hobb.
 It does make sense though; they sent a mob after us, but we weren't there.
 As long as we're gone, Hobb will have the Sniggering Pig anyway.
 As far as he's concerned, we've turned tail and ran, never to show our
 faces again,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned told Lernea, who in turn asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What about the ape-man? Won't that man, Culliper, seek revenge for his comrade?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Culliper?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cut in Winceham with a snorting laughter full of disbelief and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sea-maggot is a slave-driver, pure and simple.
 The only thing he cares about is his hide and his loot.
 For the right coin, Culliper could be working for anyone.
 Though I hear those ape-men are hard to come by, I wouldn't worry about
 Culliper.
 Not until we meet him on our own terms.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ned nodded in agreement.
 He had a bitter, austere look carved across his face when he said:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

When the time comes, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Winceham with rare sombreness.
 Lernea was about to ask something when she saw her sister up a few dozen
 yards up ahead signal a message with her hands.
 Parcifal had stooped low, her gaze searching for something through the
 night.
 What made Lernea nick an arrow though was Encelados' faint glow; the glow
 became stronger with every passing moment.
 She signaled back at Parcifal who acknowledged with a simple nod and reigned
 in Theo's mouth with her free hand.
 It seemed like the woodkin had a very vague idea of danger as something
 that could only affect other people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A faint hope of Winceham being mistaken in his assumption that something
 was amiss sprung up inside him.
 He felt he had to ask:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The sword's glowing? Is that normal?

Something evil lurks nearby.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

Ned fed a bolt in his crossbow and readied it, even as Winceham drew his
 stiletto and headed off amidst the thick brush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned with urgency.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a moonless night, there's shadows everywhere,

 said Ned sounding confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Exactly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and nodded to Lernea who afforded him a small grin.
 Within a few moments he had melded into the shadows that abounded as if
 he'd never really been there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How did he do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Lernea to Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a thief,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned as they warily made their way closer to Parcifal and Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Retired,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she hissed and Ned simply grinned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Makes for a thin alibi in some lands,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he replied and Lernea shook her head.
 As they approached Parcifal, they saw her making furious hand signals;
 her face was almost obscured in shadow but they could make out her face
 taut with bone-breaking intensity.
 The hand signals were confused, hasty; Lernea couldn't make out what her
 sister was trying to tell her in silence.
 She shook her head and waved her to repeat, while Ned was right beside
 her, aiming his crossbow at a thick patch of utter blackness that seemed
 most inviting for something that lurked out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then noticed the bunny was looking straight at him, the flames from his
 eyes having died down to crackling embers.
 The bunny curled its tiny lips into an impossible grin just for Ned alone
 to see and hurriedly burrowed inside the ground the next instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed to sigh even as Encelados began to glow fiercely, casting
 harrowing shadows of Parcifal and Theo around the thick brush.
 Parcifal repeated her message but to no avail; Lernea shook her head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is she trying to say?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's either large flying beast lurking on the treetops or mythical magical
 beast wandering up ahead, I can't tell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned swallowed hard at that; he couldn't understand what the difference in
 the quality of the information imparted was, so he simply asked, his voice
 trembling slightly, hinting of mounting tension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How is one, better news than the other?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not much of a difference.
 It's just that I claim flying kills first, while Parcifal claims the land-dwell
ers,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said matter-of-factly as she signalled her sister they were going to
 rush within whispering distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, is that true? What happens if it's a sea creature, or something that
 lives underground?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked ironically, surprised at the nonchalance of Lernea, as well as
 in himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coin toss,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as the irony was lost on her and nearly dragged Ned alongside
 her as they sprinted to cover the dstance between Parcifal and them.
 Their feet shuffled over the thick boggy floorbed as they crouched low.
 When they were in earshot, Parcifal turned around and whispered to her
 sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I said, it's a bleeding flying lizard!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Theo managed to answered promptly when he finally pushed Parcifal's
 hand aside.
 Completely heedless of the need to remain as silent as possible, he made
 sure to stand up in order to deliver his point more acutely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's utterly absurd! It's not a lizard, that's a dragonkin pure and simple.
 It is a fairly easy mistake though, since-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo was cut mid-sentence as a loud screeching noise like a sad, horrific
 wail was quickly followed by the figure of a muscular, nine-foot tall lizard-li
ke creature swooping down from the treetops towards them.
 A set of unnervingly sharp-looking claws the size of short curvy blades
 extended from its feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get down you muttering fool!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and thrust herself on Theo, bringing him down even as Ned shot
 his crossbow reflexively.
 Ned's shot missed wildly, unlike Parcifal.
 Timing her thrust, Encelados met with the creature's belly as it tried
 to leap upwards again, to hide in the lush canopy or have another go at
 them at its leisure.
 That was no longer possible, as Parcifal's blade brought it down after
 a couple of yards thrashing, wailing its high-pitched death throes in anguish,
 blood gushing freely from a lengthy wound, the creature's ghastly innards
 freely exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal quickly walked over to the dying creature and stood above it as
 it laid there, dying meekly.
 Theo exclaimed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I protest! That dragonkin-
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea could not resist the urge; she slapped him across the face and said
 to his face frozen in disbelief:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's for being an idiot.
 You can thank me for saving your life later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Theo tried to force his mouth to make audible sounds form into a semblance
 of speech, Parcifal held Encelados shoulder high and said ceremoniously:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unto the abyssal chasm I comment thee, beast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She swung Encelados down sharply and the creature's head came off its neck
 clean, like a slice of fruit.
 The pool of blood around its lifeless body was already beginning to clog,
 while the cut below the head was almost clean dry.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a mischievous look, underlined by a
 gleeful grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's one more for me, sister.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea bit back a reproachful answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You had no right for first kill! That's bad etiquette and certainly cheating!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo swallowed hard and managed to regain a measure of composure.
 He laid himself down near the creature, muttering mostly to himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The dragonkin..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters exchanged terms and conditions loudly, fighting over first kill
 rights and standing scores, while Ned noticed something peculiar and said
 to noone in particular:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that thing was evil, and that sword of yours detects evil in all its

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo chimed in morosely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because that dragonkin was Vulsek, my flying steed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters heard that and paused to wonder even as Parcifall shot a look
 at Encelados.
 It was indeed glowing, blindingly bright.
 They exchanged knowing worried looks when suddenly Winceham burst forth
 from the nearby tall grass running with all the speed his stature and years
 allowed.
 He shouted something indelible to the others without turning around to
 look, and lost himself through another thick bush behind the crest of a
 ravine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did he say? Something about a rat and tip?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned as he fumbled with his crossbow, trying to reload it in a hurry,
 shooting worried glances at the wild grass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny then popped up in front of him and started running around in circles,
 the flames from its eyes whirling in a blinding fashion.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bo looks excited about something.
 Maybe Mr.
 Abbermouth was excited about something as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and then suddenly a trio of bipedal mushrooms holding iron spears
 and using their tops as shields came out of the thick grass running awkwardly,
 exchanging long-winded moaning sounds and pointing at Theo and the rest
 agressively, judging by the way the spears faced towards the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure Winceham has a thing for mushrooms,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Lernea and let her strung arrow fly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd say he's more into greens, for sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a shake of her head and rushed the warrior-mushrooms
 head on, whirling Encelados with wild abandon.
 Ned was looking at the scene in front of him as if it were only a dream;
 he had a sudden epiphany then and told Theo who was waving his hands about
 him in a ridiculously complicated manner in preparation for a spell:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you hear the joke about the fungus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

No, what joke?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could tell you now, but it might need time to grow on you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and grinned while Theo stood pondering as his hands filled with
 a shiny, blue ball of crackling energy.
 Ned let a bolt fly straight through the mouth of a raging mushroom-warrior
 which plucked half its head off.
 Lernea was reloading her bow after her first arrow got stuck on a cap,
 and Parcifal poised Encelados for yet another slash at the mushroom directly
 in front of her, expertly avoiding its thrusts and hacking it to death
 with a few strokes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo shook with hearty laughter, at the same time hurtling the ball of lightning
 at a mushroom charging Lernea albeit with a spurious gait.
 The mushroom promptly exploded into a cloud of charred dust, fleshy bits
 of what used to form its torso flying around.
 The smell of burning fungi permeated the air.
 Parcifal made sure Encelados wasn't glowing any more before saying triumphantly
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Such is the way Encelados pierces through evil!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea sounded demoralised, even distraught:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not fair! Even Ned killed one!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned ignored the comment on his abilities as a marksman and walked over the
 body of his kill, looking for his bolt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo sounded deliriously giggly, barely able to make sense when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

See, I get that! Fungi grow, and so will the joke, which is to say, already

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled thinly but pretty soon the smile vanished when Bo the Bunny reemerged
 in front of him and smiled uncannily wide.
 Ned had another flash and asked everyone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is Winceham?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And only the bunny knew that Winceham was still running through brush and
 wood, over the bog and marsh, muttering incoherently:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Bad trip, it's a bad trip's what it is, bad trip, that's all it is..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* * *
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal had apologised to Theo, but he still looked moody; he kept Bo the
 Bunny by his side everytime.
 Curiously enough, the usually rampant bunny obliged him.
 It was as if the animal could sense Theo's loss and sympathized; which
 wasn't the weirdest thing considering it was a bunny with flames writhing
 out of its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea and Ned had found Winceham inside a pool of slimy bog water, drenched
 in muck.
 They had a hard time convincing him that the mushroom warriors were real
 enough to end up dead.
 Winceham had told them he'd quit, but he had to clarify that he didn't
 mean that he'd quit the group.
 After exchanging a few puzzled looks, they were back on the trail to Theo's
 village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crack of dawn was upon them when the saw thick plumes of smoke rise
 up into the sky behind the last crest they had to pass in order to reach
 the village.
 Theo smiled brightly for the first time since his steed had been slain:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh! They must be preparing a feast! That's never happened before!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The others exchanged knowing looks.
 Clouds of smoke usually meant that in the very unlikely event of a feast,
 something had gone terribly wrong.
 They hadn't the heart to tell Theo; he'd soon find out.
 Ned almost growled, his anger starting to boil his blood once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hobb.
 Damn his name and soul.

Winceham, who had dried up by then, sighed and added:

 while the sisters looked at the smoke with heavy, sombre frowns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

If this really is Hobb's doing, it's no longer a matter of debt, pride,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

By Skrala, we swear,

 she said and carried onwards, beside Theo, his reality distorted by his
 naive, though well-mannered demeanor.
 Lernea looked at him with pity; his eyes met hers and his smile made her
 avert her gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's wrong?

 Theo asked her and stopped as they had began to slowly climb the last hill.
 The other passed them by in silence on their way to the top.

\begin_layout Standard

I was reminded of my home, suddenly,

Are you cold, or maybe sick?

 silence.
 The other were already on the top, casting long shadows on the foliage.
 The sank had barely lifted above the green treetops, yet a warm light embraced
 their faces.

About Vulsek? It was an accident,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said without conviction.
 He was still trying to come to grips with that.
 When they reached the top, they saw the village below, fires still consuming
 houses and trees alike.
 Theo's jaw dropped in an instant, Bo always by his side, the flames in
 his eyes dying down suddenly.
 Lernea touched Theo's hand gently and told him in an almost broken voice:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry about your village.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words failed him.
 He sank to his knees on the ground, as if the last iota of strength had
 left him.
 Winceham put a hand around his shoulder and said nothing.
 Ned looked with mounting anger at the burning village, his eyes wndering
 aimlessly as if trying to comprehend.
 The crackle of fire reached them with ominous clarity.
 Trees had burned to a cinder, leaving nothing but ashes and smouldering
 stumps behind them.
 Wooden bridges laid in ruins, half-eaten by the flames, the houses at the
 top of the trees burning away like candles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun came up, its first rays lost in the glow of the fires.
 It was an unruly sight, but noone looked away; each one of them was lost
 in their own thoughts.
 Theo finally broked down in tears, a tender sob taking him over.
 Bo turned his head and his nose wrinkled; his whiskers twitched and his
 eyes lit up with a subdued flame before he ran down the hill, stopped and
 turned to look straight at Ned.
 He hopped a couple of times before running down again, towards the village.

He wants us to follow him.
 Could he have smelled something?

 said Ned and set out after the bunny.
 Parcifal shrugged a little and followed close by, while Winceham told Theo
 with a gentle voice, almost a whisper:

Theo managed to stem the tears, and said flatly, his eyes lost somewhere

 Winceham shot her a troubled look and said:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo staggered at first, then wiped his eyes with his robe, stifling another
 sob as they slowly walked downhill.
 The fire was still consuming the trees and houses, but it had mostly died
 down where it had met the rather soggy, dense forest around the grove where
 the village had once stood.
 What was left of it, was burning slowly like candle wax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny was standing on a well at the village's entrance.
 It was hopping and bouncing around like driven suddenly mad.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Theo and ran to the well.
 Parcifal was looking at the edge of the village warily; she could not escape
 a feeling of danger.
 Winceham hunched low and put his senses to good use, while Lernea asked
 Ned:
\end_layout

I'm not sure.

 Lernea looked around and said knowingly:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

There are no bodies.

 Winceham turned around and told them, rubbing his fingers full of dirt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's because they took everyone.
 At least two dozen strong, deep tracks all over the place.
 Heavy armor.
 There are no traces of a fight; there's a strange, faint smell of iron
 though.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not everyone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo as he helped an elder-looking woodkin climb out of the well.
 His plain robes were smudged and stained with soot, his face was dark.
 Grizzly long dreadlocks adorned his head, where a wooden circlet sat.
 The Elder smiled copiously as he sat down on the ground, obviousy exhausted.

 asked Theo with a furrowed brow as he helped Fingammon to his flask of

 The Elder waved the flask away and looked at Parcifal in the eyes.
 His voice had a strange, gravely quality.
 It was hoarse and he talked in a drawn out, strangely exotic way.

 Lernea also looked at the elder with a curious gaze.

How come you're not dead or missing like the others?

Fingammon the elder looked at Ned and nodded slowly.
 He spoke then, the strain on his voice bearing witness to his ordeal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They came..
 They came in a ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and looked at Theo with a longing to be believed.
 The others didn't speak but Parcifal scoffed, and Ned folded his arms on
 his chest.
 Lernea was now staring at the woodkin fiercely.

'Tis true, I know it be crazy, but 'tis true like dem fires.

 insisted Fingammon with a wild-eyed gleam on his eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Metal devils, not monsters of flesh.
 Tall as houses they be, shooting fire through their hands, eyes gleaming
 red like blood diamonds,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said with an awed, humble voice and a hand that wove shapes in the air,
 as if trying to paint them a life-like picture.
 Parcifal shook her head and sheathed Encelados.
 She put her hands on her waist:
\end_layout

Delusions.
 Devils shooting fire? Ships flying? Tales for children.

Winceham looked at her from a few feet away.
 He didn't share her opinion:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are strange things in this world.
 Things that one rarely meets when leading a sheltered life like yours,
 princess.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Parcifal took that comment as an insult and replied accordingly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My sister and I are scions bred to rule, halfuin.
 We wield sword and shield and bow, better than most of you.
 We've not been spared of tragedy, nor hurt or ruin.
 Our lives weren't sheltered; they were stolen from us,

 Instead, her sister asked her to calm down.

Mr.

Winceham nodded silently and Ned explained:

 Ned replied in earnest:

I wouldn't know anything about a flying ship, but I've read books on the

 Winceham added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The lad speaks the truth.
 Devious things, but their masters are the ones that control them.
 The ones that bid them do good or evil.

 he said somewhat detached before he continued: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If they're made of iron, that would explain the strong scent.
 About the flying ship though, I wouldn't know.
 I've only sailed with those that float on water.
 I wouldn't put it past the realm of reality though.

Dat be why, yes.

 he said and showed them an amulet he had been wearing around his neck.
 A large crystal sat inside a gold girder.
 The crystal shone with iridescent colours and the girder was covered in
 a form of writing none had ever witnessed before.
 Theo looked at it with a sudden, unexplained curiosity.
 He was inexplicably drawn to it.

\begin_layout Standard

What is that?

 Ned took a mental note of the halfuin's bad etiquette and asked Fingammon:

Why makes you think someone would go into all that trouble for a fancy amulet?
