Foreword from the author

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size footnotesize
I couldn't really find a working subtitle for this first book in what's
 to become a series.
 Arguably, it's not a book per se (meaning not a full length novel), but
 a book it is still.

Party of Five
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 starts off with this book here, and I envision it as a series of novellas
 that I want to keep writing, evolving the characters and the world as I
 go.
 I could do that it in a full length novel, but it's much easier for me
 to write smaller, self-contained adventures that are linked together through
 the same characters, being fresh and different each time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align left

\size footnotesize
Plus, I think a series of novellas can reach an audience faster and it easier
 and more practical (hopefully more fun) to read for most people.
 It is also my opinion that the novella as a genre, needs some more love
 from authors and readers alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

I dearly hope you'll come to like the characters enough to wait for the
 next novella in the series.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The universe, children, is a vast, gloriously beautiful thing that is mostly
 uncaring.
 It's up to us, me and you and the common folk as well, to breath a sense
 of justice into it; a balance between right and wrong.
 Careful not to overdo it though, cause it could tip over your heads when
 you least expect it to.
 Like an oxcart full of manure.

\begin_layout Section*
Part One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was standing on the docks, watching the good ship Autania as it
 gracefully waded through the peaceful waters of Hobb's Bay; the wind was
 at her stern, her sails full.
 She was making good speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hope the damn thing sinks and they all drown,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a deep scowl on her proud face.
 Behind her, the small harbor was settling into its nightly rhythm.
 Rowdy sailors were looking for the next tavern in line to get drunk and
 have a brawl, the traders were finishing up their business with shady-looking
 characters and the fishermen were readying ther nets for the break of dawn
 and their next catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was sitting right beside her on the stony pier, her naked feet dangling
 in the water.
 She asked Parcifal with a look of tempered sadness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does that mean we can't go back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, we can't go back Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a sigh and a shook her head.
 Her piercing hazel eyes were stuck gazing somewhere beyond the rosy-red
 horizon, fiddling with her cropped red hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with understanding and raised an eyebrow.
 She noticed Parcifal had an angry, bothersome look about her and knew her
 timing was off.
 But she had to ask her anyway:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not ever?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head slowly around and stabbed Lernea with a fierce
 look before answering coldly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not as long as the Jangdrivals are in power and the Unseen Council remains
 in place, not while the Eleven Pillars stand and the Noble Eagles fly above
 the Skarlas, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Her tone was harsh, unerringly final.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea put a finger on her lip and spent a few moments playing with a lock
 of her long, brown hair.
 She then frowned from frustration and asked her sister once more: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that never ever, or really just a long time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You vex me, sister.
 Never means never,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal dryly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, didn't master Sisyphus always say, `never say never'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with a hesitant smile creeping up on her lip.
 Parcifal's visage turned suddenly sorrowful, like a noble, sleek and gray
 statue in the palace grounds they would never see again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Master Sisyphus is dead, Lernea.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That doesn't mean he was wrong, though.
 Never is such a final word, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 retorted Lernea and stood upright on her toes, with hands on her waist.
 She faced her sister with a bright smile full of optimism which Parcifal
 clearly did not share.
 Her sister's attitude made Parcifal's sadness turn into barely suppressed
 anger at Lernea's persistence to face their new reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get it right in that little thick skull of yours, Lernea.
 We are, never, going, back, to, Nomos.
 Never!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, a lone finger rapping at Lernea's breastplate with a clanging
 sound after every word.
 Lernea's eyes wandered to her chest for a moment, before her face reddened
 and her breathing became more pronounced.
 Her nostrils flared up and she turned her gaze at her sister.
 She pouted her lips and said icily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I think I'll just do what I please from now on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal; her face had the look of a poised hawk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate it when you do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea in the same vein, shaking her head slowly with mounting irritation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know, that's why I do it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're such a child,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with disdain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Says the one who can't accept defeat!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's loud tone made a few heads turn and look.
 Lernea did not even notice they were attracting the attention of the locals,
 and added her own shouts to the rising din of their heated debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This isn't about winning or losing, by Skrala! You can't be that daft!

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're the one that got us into this mess in the first place, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with arms crossed on her chest.
 Lernea flailed her arms wildly around her while moving about nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, really now that's just so typical, trying to put the blame on me like
 we're still meddling with the master's spellbook!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I'm not the one who married Therion Jangdrival on a whim and got us
 exiled!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Parcifal with wide open arms and a mocking smile.
 Lernea's reply was filled with overtones of shock and disgust, her face
 scrounged up, her revulsion evident in every word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was him or Gheighran! Have you even seen Gheighran? He's a walking swamp-thin
g, not a man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal shook her head and berated her slightly older sister, her face
 suddenly grim and her voice low-keyed and even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that how you make decisions about your kingdom, my Queen? Based on looks
 and appearances? Only if mother were alive..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let her voice trail off and ventured a look towards the ocean.
 The Autania's sail was barely visible, the light of day growing dimmer
 with every passing minute.
 Lernea was looking at her feet, feeling scolded and reprimanded like a
 child.
 Yet, when she talked next she had the voice of a proud woman:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mother made mistakes as well in her reign.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, she did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal nodding and went on to shout, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She gave birth to you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're only a minute apart, you stupid-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stopped in mid-sentence even as her mouth began to form the word
 `cow'.
 She had instinctively flung her arm and was grabbing at what seemed to
 be a child's arm attached to a hand holding her coinpurse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and turned to look nearly right behind her.
 There was a short person standing there, all dressed up in dark leather
 and an impossibly bland, expressionless face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal grabbed a silver, teardrop-shaped knife from her waistbelt and
 took a step towards her sister's side where the short person stood frozen,
 said person pretending he was nothing more than a misplaced piece of furniture.
 He seemed to be holding his breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A thieving scum, and a bad one at that, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the short person with a whizz.
 Out of breath, he looked sideways at the bristling knifepoint and suddenly
 sucked on air through his nostrils loudly.
 His body relaxed and he let the bulging coinpurse drop to the wooden pier
 with a heavy jingle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea made a grimace and turned her head away from the short man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see why you held that breath of yours.
 Could even kill a man; one of your stature, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed less inclined to comment on the aspiring thief's lack of
 mouth hygiene.
 She looked at him with mixed feelings of curiosity and frustration, brandishing
 her knife accusingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barely stepped foot on this land, and here's our greeting.
 Couldn't resist our riches, little man?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal, her shiny breastplate protruding from the rest of her body
 armor straight at the thief's face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be fair, my fair lady! Wasn't ogling your, ehm, lady parts or anything,
 your gracefulness.
 Not that they're not worth to, well, ogle,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with an awkward smile and looked up to Parcifal like a man seeking
 redemption in prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea punched him in the gut without warning; the short little man doubled
 over, his face flustered.
 He looked momentously suprised and awestruck, rather than simply hurt;
 he seemed to have some trouble breathing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She was talking about our money, our armor, our valuables! Really, to address
 any woman in such a fashion.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned and looked at her sister with a bewildered expression, squinting
 her eyes slightly, her knife still aimed at the thief's general direction
 who was trying to stand up again to his full four feet of height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all about being a queen proper, isn't it? He was addressing me, not
 you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea grinned and straightened her hair before she mused mostly to herself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You really can't get over the fact I am the firstborn, rightful heir to
 the throne and all that, can you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fact is, you're a spoiled brat if I've ever se-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal left her sentence incomplete as she noticed the coinpurse, as well
 as the thief, had simply vanished out of sight.
 She looked at the milling crowd behind them reflexively.
 In the scarce light of the setting sun she spotted the rather short leather-cla
d thief, idly walking about with his hands in his pockets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She ran after him while Lernea hurriedly put on her boots and followed close
 behind.
 With little effort she nudged her way past a couple of bystanders who were
 idly having a smoke and grabbed the man by his cloak.
 She lifted him up like a runaway child and handed him over to Lernea, who
 grabbed him with both hands from his vest's collar.
 The sisters sported positively miffed, if not thunderous, looks.
 The short little man exploded with furious indignation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do say! What manner of outrage is this now? Bellicose women running rampant
 in the streets? Is there no law, no order in this cauldron of misery and
 debauchery? Guards! Guards!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters looked at the man intently for a moment, examining him like
 some sort of exotic bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and Lernea nodded affirmatively and added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no mistaking that breath.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man looked at each of them with a deeply hurt, vastly presumptious look
 and raised a hand before speaking.
 His eyes remained closed haughtily for the better part of his little speech:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can dispense with the insult to my dwarven heritage concerning my breath
 since as a gentleman, I am aware that great allowances should be made for
 differences of custom and training.
 I can understand from your appearance you are foreigners, probably fresh
 off the boat, clearly confused and utterly misguided as to the identity
 of my person.
 Although you are clearly lacking in proper lady-like training and manners,
 such is my gentleness and strength of character, that I am willing to forego
 any and all legal accusations and forthcoming tribulations against your
 persons, should you deposit me safely and unharmed on the ground so I may
 go about my business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head and looked at Lernea with a raised eyebrow.
 Lernea shot back her sister a familiar look and nodded, before upending
 the short man who claimed to be a dwarf.
 She then proceeded to hold him by his legs and shake him vigorously.
 Other than a couple of bored, curious looks, noone seemed particularly
 inclined to question what has happening.
 In Hobb's Bay, anything less than a stabbing wasn't a matter of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments later a rush of metallic clangs was heard as various items
 fell on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aha!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea gleefully, while her sister shook her head with an uncertain
 look on her face.
 The short little man who claimed to be a dwarf and a gentleman no less
 was looking at the two ladies sternly, his short grey ponytail swinging
 as he lay hanging upside down, his hands crossed on his chest like some
 sort of human-like bat having a difficult time sleeping.
 His cloak brushed against the items that had fallen from his person; a
 small metallic disc with a chain, a gold, flat square tin like a cigar
 holder, and a small, thin stiletto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal pouted her lips and made a rolling motion with her hands to Lernea,
 which went largely unnoticed.
 Lernea said with a wide grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What say you now, thief?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She made sure to intone the word 
\shape italic
thief
\shape default
 as it meant someone oozing gritty, unhealthy amounts of slime from every
 available orifice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal bulged her eyes and made frantic motions to Lernea to put the man
 down, pointing to the unfamiliar items that had fallen on the ground instead
 of the expected loot, their property.
 Lernea finally took a look on her own and hesitantly put the short man
 back on his own two feet.
 He looked at them with a most severe look that implied he could not find
 the words to begin to describe his feelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I cannot find the words to even begin to describe my feelings,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a face scrounged up from disgust.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should be ashamed.
 I fear, I cannot in right conscience call you ladies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, dusted off his cloak, straightened his vest and pants and walked
 away briskly without another word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at him in mute disbelief, while Lernea picked up the man's
 items from the ground, spending a mere moment to examine them.
 His small figure had almost disappeared into the mass of people crowding
 the busy street when she shouted at him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir! Terribly sorry, but you forgot your articles, sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at the various stuff the man had left behind and had a moment

Lernea stood motionless for moment, idly holding the stolen goods with both
 hands in her lap.
 Her lips formed a soundless circle while her eyes shone with dazzling ferocity.
 Realizing they had been duped, she dropped everything and ran after her
 sister and the dwarf - or perhaps a simply very short man - who kept surprising
 them with his sly ways.

The man shot a glance behind his back and saw the sisters were right on
 his tail, shoving and brushing people aside as they ran after him.

 he shouted amidst the crowd in an effort to cause a little bit of hysterical
 panic to make his escape all that easier.
 That didn't work though; the people around him went about their business,
 a few casually wondering to themselves whether or not they had heard some
 kind of voice; those who did hear wondered where it came from.
 He had to make himself scarce the hard way, and bolted into the nearest
 building.

 replied Parcifal even as they left the stream of people in the street and

 doorway.
 Sounds of drunken merryment and folk music blasted away from the relatively
 large inn.

Inside the Sniggering Pig, there was ample candle light from chandeliers
 on the high ceiling, as well as candles and lamps on each and every table
 where people had still not passed out.
 A powerful mix of heavy scents dominated the air; rye, ale and roasted
 meat.
 The tables were mostly occupied by rowdy gangs of shady-looking sailors;
 everyone seemed to be having fun judging by the spillage on the floor,
 when the music suddenly stopped.
 The hubbub of laughter and loud conversation filled the emptiness until
 a rather tall and lanky fellow appeared at the far end of tavern, on what
 seemed to be the stage where the band of musicians sat.
 Parcifal's eyes had the chance to search the room for a moment.
 There was no sign of the thief.

As if on cue, the tall lank man who had appeared on stage cleared his throat
 loudly and bowed, only to receive a handful of drunken irrelevant yells,

 Nevertheless, he smiled courteously and said to the crowd:

Well, this place is lively, ain't it? Feels like a band of roaming Dwarves

 The performer was facing a tough crowd.

 something else.
 She told Lernea:

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea let out a little laugh, more aptly a snigger, and put a hand to her

 Parcifal eyed her in puzzlement, her brow furrowed.
 Lernea replied with a giggly voice:

Parcifal closed her eyes, said nothing and sighed.
 Then she slowly started wading through the tables, filled with passed-out

 The comedian was having a go at another joke, while the crowd had mysteriously
 quietened down.
 Lots of sets of eyes were now following Parcifal's slender form as she
 moved about the tavern.

The drum roll came on cue, but the laughter he was expecting was delayed
 until a man who had been standing on all fours yelled,

Barkeep! Ha ha ha! I gets it! Bar-keep!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spontaneously, half the tavern erupted in fits of laughter, while the other
 half lay motionless except for their eyes, magnetised by Parcifal's presence.
 Even if staring at her meant her staring back at them with a look that
 could shrivel their scrotum and turn their eyes into tiny glass beads.
 The comedian went on:

Lovely crowd here tonight, lovely crowd.

\begin_layout Standard
There was no drum roll.
 The man on stage eyed the band and waved his hands.
 Then came a drum roll and the signature cowbell.
 The crowd though wasn't paying attention; they kept drinking and singing
 rowdy songs, mostly containing obscene lyrics about unicorns and the priest's
 daughter.
 There was a voice of dissent though that rose sharply above the cacophony:

It was the thief, all flustered, standing up on his toes to make himself
 heard.
 Parcifal turned her head around and saw him, pointing an accusing finger
 at the man on stage.
 She drew her sword and shouted above the din of the crowd, cradling the
 heavy blade threateningly towards the thief:

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly the crowd stopped everything they had been doing; the singing ceased
 to be.
 The band on the other hand, much to the comedian's dismay, started to play
 a suspenseful tune.
 The sound of whistling pipes was dominant.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Excuse me now, I'm sure there's been some kind of misunderstanding.

Balls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 they said in one voice and everyone was suddenly holding something that
 could kill, maim, or hurt like hell, most prominently forks, knives and
 the odd cutlass and pistol.
 Parcifal stood in the midst of them all, perhaps fifty or sixty men the
 lot of them, half of them still conscious.
 She gave Lernea a look of determined despair and grasped her sword with
 both hands, ready for what seemed to be a sudden, uneven fight to the death.
 Lernea nodded to her sister without a word and loaded her bow with an arrow.
 In one fluid motion, she was already aiming at the thief's head from a
 very comfortable distance; she couldn't miss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thief looked at her, grinned, bowed slightly and yelled:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd erupted in sudden cheers and howls, while someone yelled `Balls!'
 right before slumping down on the floor.
 The comedian got off the stage disheartened and headed for the bar.
 The band picked up a serene ballad that noone really cared for.
 The barkeep smiled congenially to the comedian and told him: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal and Lernea were standing amidst the merry crowd with their weapons
 at the ready, but it was evident in the way their faces were scrounged
 up that they felt relieved, confused and mildly insulted at the same time.
 Parcifal would not leave the thief from her sight; he approached her with
 both hands in the air, making sure his palms were open.
 He was smiling thinly, looking at Encelados with a keen, respectful eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea lowered her bow and strung it behind her back.
 She walked over to her sister, being very careful not to tread on someone
 or someone's heaved insides, spilled beer and other assorted spots of trouble
 that could be found on the Sniggering Pig's floor in abundance.

Well, I'm not the stubborn, hot-headed, beautiful though foreign lady.

 Lernea stood by her sister's side and pondered for a moment before she
 said with a calm voice:

I think there's a reason for all this, sister.

 Parcifal looked at the man as he had insulted everything holy by Skrala

Parcifal couldn't believe her ears, but followed along as if in somekind

 Winceham led the way and drew their chairs charmingly.
 As they sat down he made a motion with a hand to the bar, always smiling.
 Parcifal said as if still in a dream:

 noise, unusually louder than the din of the laughing, merry sailors.
 A large bulky man dressed in a scaly leather vest, matching boots and cornered

 he yelled and spat a vile green lump of slime on the floor.
 Beside him stood a tall, ape-like creature dressed mostly in rugs and cloth,
 all muscle and hair.
 It carried a blunderbuss as tall as a man and grinned widely, its mouth
 filled with golden teeth.
 Like a silent church bell had rung, everyone, even the band, promptly picked
 up their hats and passed-out companions and left in a hurry, though the
 last man was mindful to enough to close the door behind him.
 Winceham reached out and touched the sisters' hands awkwardly; he had a
 desperate look on his face.

 There was fearful anxiety written there; the sisters shared their opinion

 Ned appeared from behind the bar, holding the sisters' coinpurse, still

Winceham rolled his eyes wildly trying to signal the sisters.
 His efforts went largely unnoticed since they had both turned to face what

 The ape-man took the coinpurse from Ned and started counting the money.
 Ned fidgeted behind the bar.

 His father looked at him in the eye, shook his head and bit his lip.

 said Culliper, smiled broadly, briefly tipped his hat with his cutlass

 He took a step and stopped when he heard the sound of metal grinding on
 metal.
 Parcifal had drawn her sword and was pointing it at Culliper's back.
 He slowly turned around and saw Lernea had also nocked an arrow, ready
 to draw at the blink of an eye.

 said Lernea who let an arrow fly right between Mr.
 Brumbles eyes before he had a chance to even swerve the gun their way.
 A gunshot rang clear though; Culliper was holding a pistol with smouldering
 smoke trailing off its barrel.
 Ned's father was down on the floor with a dull thud barely a moment later.
 Parcifal sprang at Culliper with all the might of her sword, but he parried
 expertly with his cutlass as he turned to leave.
 Lernea was reloading her bow even as Ned cried in outrage,

Culliper jumped up on a nearby table and rushed towards a window.
 Lernea's arrow caught him on the shoulder.
 He cried in agony even as Ned was rushing right behind him.
 Parcifal saw the barrel of a pistol aiming blindly towards Ned, even as
 Culliper made ready to jump through the window; she did not hesitate and
 grabbed Ned by his waist as he run.
 She brought him down right when a bullet flew over his head and turned
 part of the wooden bar into a bunch of smouldering splinters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper crashed through the window and onto the street.
 He landed on one side, rolled, and quickly got back on his feet.
 He glanced at them and then ran away cursing even as one of Lernea's arrows
 grazed his back.

Why are you just standing there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked, even though noone was technically standing.
 Parcifal was on her knees, nurturing a hurt jaw.
 She had a bloody lip and she was staring at Ned like a wounded tiger.
 Ned was lying with his back against the bar, a stream of tears trailing
 his cheeks, his face flustered.
 Winceham was sitting on the same chair as before, his face planted smugly
 in the palms of his hands in complete silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

He punched me in the face,

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was wholly ignoring her, his face a mask of stone cold grief.
 His tears had just began to dry out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea suddenly looked deeply disappointed, almost heartbroken, as she held
 an arrow in one hand and her bow in the other, her shoulders sagged.
 She shook her head, put the arrow in her quiver and the bow across her

 to noone in particular:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters both turned to look at him with an even gaze.
 They met his blood-ridden eyes and with a glance saw his father's lifeless
 body on the floor to his right.
 They stooped their heads low and crossed their arms on their chests before
 they told him humbly in unison:

Ned looked at them with menace, a sudden viciousness in the young man's
 otherwise gentle, homely face.
 His voice was calm, but it somehow managed to sound brazen, harsh and vibrant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

My father has no need for keen wails and haughty words.
 He's dead and dead men have no need of anything other than a grave.

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters remained silent, neither one venturing to speak her mind.
 Winceham broke the silence when he rubbed his face with both hands along

 a deep slumber.
 He caused everyone, even Ned, to turn their heads his way.

It still is just money,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

It would have kept Vern alive and this place going for some time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and waved a hand around.
 He picked up a small satchel from the floor and told them: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We've tarried too long.
 By midnight, Hobb's men will be scouring the Bay.
 I suggest you make yourselves scarce as well and keep a low profile.

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded at the two sisters and said with a dry voice: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Dump the gear as well, you two,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 before he turned to Ned and said with a weary look and a bleak voice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry, Ned.
 There is no perfect plan.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Ned replied with a deep, rumbling hatred in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll kill his men.

 I want to see him beg for his life before I squeeze his last breath out

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had a feral look about him; a keen, proud gaze.
 It was as if he had been Ned's long lost twin, a battle-hardened warrior
 who sought revenge.
 In truth, he was still little more than the meek, aspiring bard son of
 Vern Larkin, doubling as the inn's cook.
 And Winceham told him so, trying not to sound unkind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Lad, you've a fiery heart, I'll give you that.
 But it's in the wrong place.

Parcifal interjected with a nod of approval:

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea approached the rest and came to stand by her sister's side with a
 regal smile painted on her face, her hands on her hips.
 She pointed a finger at Winceham as if he was some kind of lowly subject

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You, halfuin, you are the one who is sorely mistaken.

Winceham sighed and stared at the empty cup for a while.
 He then told Lernea:

You figured all that out by yourself? And I thought, Nomos was full of stupid

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Lernea went wide-eyed in shocked surprise.
 Before she had time to retort, Parcifal had her sword drawn, poised in

Forswear that insult! Unsay it or Encelados be your last woe!

 Winceham, seeing the steely tip of Encelados flash brightly in the candlelight,
 spoke faster than perhaps ever, in one breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You do have a penchant for the dramatic, don't you? I was only making an

 Since it seems to be an idea foreign to you, I'm particularly sorry I ever

 I therefore renounce my comment, recant the implication of an insult, renege

Parcifal sheathed her sword and calmness returned to her face, while Lernea

No need to mock us with fancy words, sir,

 she said, and forced a thin smile on her mouth.
 She went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We know enough about sarcasm to not use it in serious matters.
 We've been trained in languages and the arts, as well as the ways of the

 Such is the way of Nomos; we are not simpletons, mind you.
 We are warrior-maidens of the Mountain Garden, not simple women who would
 rather spent their days serving a lowly, unworthy husband as their master.
 We demand respect and earn it our way; we obey the laws but listen to our

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea managed to awe everyone into stilled silence, including her sister.
 Winceham managed to nod, yet enchanted by Lernea's presence.
 The silence was broken by Ned, who took Lernea by the arm suddenly and
 spoke from heart, the words rushing freely out his mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You've spoken true milady; even a fool would feel that.
 I know this then; that you and your sister are noble women, with brave,

 Help me avenge my father's death, miladies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked at Ned with a surprised half-smile; it seemed he was being
 utterly serious and fully aware of what such an oath entailed.
 Parcifal saw her sister's face brighten up.
 She placed her hand gently on Ned's shoulder and told him heartily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's no need for that Ned.
 We are free women and our people, are free people; we do not offer them

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's face was overcome by a hard, edgy smile that crept up on his lips.
 He nodded solemnly and offered his arm to Parcifal which she grasped firmly.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a set of proud eyes and said with a

Do you even hear yourselves? I can understand Ned is upset and has little

 He went on promptly as soon as Lernea nodded matter-of-factly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He does as he pleases and that is due to two things; money and power.
 Money keeps his henchmen, guards and foot soldiers happy to work and even
 die occasionally for him, as do the crews on his ships roaming the seas
 for loot and plunder.
 That same money, the money he keeps making by bleeding everyone just short
 of dry, just like he did to Vern and the Sniggering Pig.
 That money bought him an Imperial Consulate and soon if word has it right,
 a place as Princeps of the Court.

 If there's still such a thing.

No.
 Just someone who they share a lot of common traits with,

\begin_layout Standard

We lost the throne and were exiled from Nomos,

 answered Lernea tersely.
 Winceham smiled with irony and said:

See? And that was probably them being very gracious.
 Hobb isn't gracious.
 At all.

 Lernea told them, and Winceham retorted:

No, you'll have a retired thief and a bard who can't sing and tells bad

Retired?

 asked Parcifal in disbelief, while Ned exclaimed:

It's always a tough crowd!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

 Lernea asked Ned, cocking her head sideways.

\begin_layout Standard

I can sing! I'm just more of a comedy performer! Why does everyone say that?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

No, I'm asking if he is retired,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why do you think you caught me red-handed both times? My joints have been

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the Hauflin with a slightly embarassed look.
 Lernea's words had a hint of arrogance about them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Small matter; we weren't counting on you as our first line of defense.

\begin_layout Standard

I see.
 You ask for my help, nay, demand it by Nadragatea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham eyeing Ned with a look of disappointment before returning
 his gaze to Lernea and adding: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then when you learn I'm retired, I'm suddenly worthless.
 Great management skills for a queen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, looking irreparably emotionally hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She didn't see the Jangdrivals coming either.

 protests of her scowling sister:

Ned intervened:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Stop this, please.
 Stop this badmouthing.
 It leads nowhere.
 If we are going to do this, we need to stick together; we need to support

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone took a moment in silence.
 Parcifal and Lernea looked at each other briefly, reassuringly.
 Winceham nodded to himself and pouted his lips before speaking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need a plan.
 A damn good plan preferably of the genius kind with implausibly good luck
 to boot.
 But first, we need to leave this place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and picked up his satchel, looking sideways through the window
 for any sign of Hobb's men.
 Parcifal and Lernea nodded and checked their gear smartly, while Ned shook
 his head and curtly said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

No.
 First we need to bury my father.

Ned, lad.

 Hobb's men could be right around the corner.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stared at Winceham unyieldingly for a few moments, until they all looked
 at each other and simply walked over to the body of Ned's father and helped
 him carry the body of Vern Larkin out back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was on the lookout, while Ned, Parcifal and even Lernea, much to
 her sister's surprise, began to dig in a hurry.

Are you sure this is the right way?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal who had taken point alongside Ned, Encelados firmly clasped
 on her back, tiny slithers of starlight bouncing off her glistening armor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Father and I used to hunt boar around these parts.
 We'd find traces of the Woodkin here and there; tripped animal traps and
 hand-picked herbs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ned with certainty, his eyes wading through the darkness of the
 night warily.
 He carried an old hunting crossbow strung along the belt at his waist.
 What the others couldn't help noticing though was the small leather drum
 he had strapped on his back, none of whom had found particularly able to
 deal damage when the need arose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How can you be sure it was elves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham slightly out of breath as he tried to keep pace with the
 rest, his satchel bobbing wildly.
 Ned's reply was taciturn at best:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A somewhat uneasy silence followed.
 Lernea gracefully trod through the thick, lush brush as if this southern,
 exotic forest was her natural habitat.
 At length she too felt the need to ask Ned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

These elves you speak of, what makes you so certain they'll want to help?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned paused in his stride, turned around and looked at Lernea with a grin
 that shone unnervingly even though the light of the stars was barely enough
 to see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said loudly, his voice echoing faintly as it bounced off the surrounding
 hills.
 He resumed walking alongside Parcifal, his eyes glancing at everyone with
 obvious aggravation, letting them know he wasn't in the mood for questions.
 The rest exchanged doubtful looks, but knew that for the time being, asking
 questions would serve no purpose other than driving Ned slightly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had been slowly climbing Silkcrest Hill, no more than an hour's reach
 from Hobb's Bay to the west.
 The minute after they had finished burying Ned's father, they had heard
 a rather rowdy crowd on the street, asking for them to come out and be
 hanged for the murders they had committed.
 Hobb seemed to know how to put the blame on people and rouse the rest into
 an angry mob; Ned, Winceham and the Teletha sisters were wanted for murder
 and unlawful pillaging to boot.
 Without the need to talk it over, Ned and the rest had fleeted Hobb's bay
 through alleys and backstreets onto the nearby woods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned had come up with what was now effectively their plan, which wasn't much
 as everyone had commented, but it was their best shot, not to mention their
 only and perhaps their last one as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They'd seek out the secretive Woodkin elves that some said dwelt deep in
 the jungle where death lurked in many forms: quicksand, snakes, and other
 wildlife did not discriminate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham stopped and bent over his knees; his face was a grimace, his lungs
 burning from the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't feel me legs.
 We need to take a break,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said in between deep, pained breaths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can't stop now, not until we've found them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a sense of urgency.
 He sounded annoyed, but there was tiredness in his speech as well.
 The sisters nodded and Parcifal unsheathed Encelados, and buried it into
 the ground with ease.
 Lernea sat down on the ground and unclasped a bright, silver canteen from
 her belt.
 She brought it to her lips and drank, before offering it to Winceham who
 gladly downed a mouthful himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are you doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned in utter disbelief, even though it was plainly obvious they were
 taking a break.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can't march all through the night without some rest, Ned.
 Not us, not you, and certainly not half-man there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and pointed to Winceham with a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin.
 Do I need to spell it out to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Winceham managed to reply huffing and puffing.
 He shot Parcifal a weary look and sat down himself with a growl of exertion.
 He shook his head and said somewhat bitterly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I should've ran when I had the chance.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You wouldn't have gone that far now, would you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, her words not unkind but rather playful, judging by the thin
 smile on her face.
 Her look became suddenly worried though when she noticed Ned had already
 wandered off westwards, without so much as a word, much like a stubborn
 child.
 Lernea shot Parcifal a stern look which her sister waved away.
 Parcifal shrugged, resting with her hands around Encelados hilt, the blade
 firmly in the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's strong-willed, I'll give him that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said as she looked at Ned's figure growing smaller with the distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well he's bound to get lost or do something stupid.
 Or both.
 So go talk some sense into him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea with a worried frown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea and swiftly set after Ned on her own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham stretched and a faint popping and crackling was heard; he let out
 a sigh and fiddled with his satchel.
 After a while he was holding a small leather pouch and a small, delicate
 pipe.
 Those items instantly attracted Parcifal's attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked bluntly, cocking her head sideways as if trying to peek.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does it look like to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham without affording her even a glance, too busy filling his
 pipe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Some sort of pipe, perhaps?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Parcifal with carefully measured uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm surprised someone imparted with such a high level of intelligence would
 be so levelheaded as to ask men of lesser caliber than myself such paltry
 questions for the mere sake of conversation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and lit his pipe, drawing in the smoke deeply.
 A smile of pure joy formed on his face and he laid himself flat on the
 ground, little whisps of smoke twirling intensely wherever starlight poured
 through as they wafted upwards around his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's turned her head and looked towards her sister and Ned.
 Her eyes searched for them intently but she could barely make their shadows
 further up the hill, shrouded by the tall grass.
 They seemed to have stopped, probably talking by the way she saw her sister
 flailing her hands about her.
 She then asked Winceham with a rather peculiar voice, as if she was concerned
 someone might overhear them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could I .
 .
 .
 Could I have a whiff of that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham sat upright slowly and opened his eyes; they were red-shot, covered
 with a slightly glazed sheen.
 He looked all-too serene and calm, his face adorned by a lopsided smile
 that verged on drooling.
 He simply passed Parcifal the pipe and nodded languidly, his eyes half-open
 as if about to yawn and fall asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal leaned toward Winceham and took the proferred pipe with one hand.
 She took a drag and held it before closing her eyes, her lip curling in
 a slight grin.
 She then blew out the smoke in the shape of small circles, before handing
 back the pipe.
 She then straightened her back and stood watchful as ever with Encelados
 always clasped in her hands, her gaze and indeed her whole face standing
 out in the night, prouder and brighter than before.
 It was a stark contrast to the way Winceham looked, as if he'd just woken
 up from a really rough night that involved all sorts of debauchery.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey..
 What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham as he looked back and forth between Parcifal and the pipe
 with an expression of amazed wonder as if something miraculously extraordinairy
 had happened right in front of his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he thought he saw a pair of trembling flames behind a nearby bush.
 He blinked and saw the flames flicker wildly, before vanishing swiftly
 with a harrowing speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What in all blazes? I must be having a bad trip,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham mostly to himself and put out his pipe.
 Parcifal overheard him and commented:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not that rough of a trail.
 When my sister and I had to go through the trails of Jordenfall though..
 That was rough, I'll tell you that.
 Sheer cliffs, hundreds of feet high, slippery ice every step of the way

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Her face was cringing but her voice was a bitter sweetness.
 It was the voice of someone who reminisces better times.
 Winceham eyed her with a worried look, his brow furrowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure you're okay? Not feeling lightheaded, sleepy, giggly, silly,
 weird in many different ways?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked her genuinely interested.
 She took a moment, shook her head and replied earnestly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No..
 Couldn't be better.
 Top notch.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was looking at her puzzled beyond understanding when his eyes bulged
 up with sudden terror.
 He saw the trembling flames from before, trailing orange light in their
 wake.
 They were attached to the head of bunny were its eye sockets should be;
 it was hopping about not further than a few feet away.
 His jaw dropped and he looked at his pipe before staring at the bunny mesmerize
d.
 The bunny paused as if it knew, stared back at Winceham and smiled unnervingly
 before hopping out of view and into some kind of burrowed hole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you see that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he exclaimed as he got up on his feet and poked Parcifal in the arm repeatedly.
 She was instantly energized; she drew Encelados out of the ground and swung
 it around her wrist expertly, poised to strike.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Winceham with an unsteady voice and pulled out a stiletto from his
 belt.
 The blade was dull, thin and long like a spike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 said Parcifal with a grin.

\end_inset

Great, that's great.
 I'm not having a bad trip, it's just that something actually weird is going
 on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and sighed.
 He collected his thoughts for a moment before trying to convince Parcifal
 that a strange rabbit with flaming eyes was in the vicinity.
 He felt that stressing the flaming eyes bit was essential since normal
 rabbits mixed with fire can't hop, not while on a roasting spit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal, look.
 It might seem strange but there's a bunny with its eyes on fire hopping
 around us somewhere.
 And I think it knows that I know.
 We must be very careful, stay still and silent.
 I can't stress enough that it's eyes are on fire and it's not dead yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham as he scanned the area around them inch by inch, expecting
 some catch a glimpse of the strange rabbit.
 Parcifal eyed the man with a sudden sorrow and shook her head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Poor Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then as if out of nowhere, the figure of a robed, masked man appeared behind
 Parcifal and leaned respectfully towards her ear.
 The man waved his hands and fingers in an elaborate gesture and whispered
 to her in a thin, calm and gentle voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is no bunny.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was stunned into silence.
 He was thinking that perhaps he should point out that there was a strange
 man right behind Parcifal whispering to her ear, but decided to wait until
 she knew that herself, just to make sure he wasn't imagining things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal as she turned around to face the stranger with Encelados
 readied in her hand.
 She was calm yet mindful of the stranger who appear unarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No answer came.
 Instead the man simply stood there, frozen still like a statue, his hands
 clasped together as if in prayer.
 His eyes remained closed and he hardly seemed to breathe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you not answer me, stranger?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Parcifal demanded of him with mounting volume in her voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe he's right, maybe there is no bunny,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Winceham when he suddenly saw the bunny break through the ground
 from behind Parcifal.
 It stood with it's eyes locked directly onto Winceham's gaze.
 Its nose twitched and Winceham saw the flames flash wildly for a moment,
 right before an intense feeling of chillness crept up his spine and made
 the hairs on his head stand.
 And then he saw the rabbit smile mischievously, dig back in and disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was pointing to the ground in stunned silence, eyes wide open and
 his arm trembling when Parcifal said to the silent stranger:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am Parcifal Teletha, scion of Phedra Teletha and Helios, of the Teletha

\begin_layout Standard
Her tone was noble yet menacing.
 It was easy for someone to see she meant everyword by her thunderous stare.

I don't care about your delusions! What manner of person is this man who

 from all the shouting.
 She bit them back a scolding stare but what caught her eye was the strange
 man and the fact he was looking straight at her.
 She was confused for a moment and then staring back at him with all the
 nobility she could muster under the circumstances, she asked him:

The silent figure was shocked into motion, taking a sudden step away from
 everyone else, his arms extended in a purely defensive gesture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You can see me? Impossible!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said to Lernea, stressing the last word as if it were certainly absurd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea and Parcifal exchanged a quick look.
 Parcifal nodded affirmatively while Lernea replied with an indifferent
 shrug.
 Winceham said then in aggravation:

I beg your pardon! Bo is not a monster!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the figured man irately, instantly letting go off his prohibitions
 concerning the fact he was completely visible to everyone involved.
 He took off his mask and hood, and a couple of pointy ears flopped suddenly
 upright.
 He protested:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bo is very kind and completely harmless.
 Not a monster at all.
 I demand you take that back!

 said the stranger with the flair of someone who isn't really used to demanding
 things of people.

\begin_layout Standard

 exclaimed Winceham flailing his hands about him, laughing inspite of himself

\begin_layout Standard

Yes, who are you? And how is your hair that fair?

 added Lernea with an inquiring furrow of her brow.

Shut up!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's roaring shout caused everyone's gaze to fall upon him.
 He cleared his throat and said with an inspiring voice, the voice of a
 true leader:
\end_layout

The clock's ticking.
 Stop mucking about with nonsense.

Everyone remained silent; Parcifal smiled thinly and nodded, while Lernea
 added:

Ned's right.
 I for one, agree.

Bo? He's always around, I wouldn't worry about him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're Woodkin, aren't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned.
 The stranger gasped; he was once more shocked into silence for a moment
 before managing to stutter slightly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How..
 How do you know that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said with a tremor in his voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham cut in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The pointy ears, the blond, long hair.
 The silly hood and mask.
 That's just like you people.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The stranger shot an off-beat glance at Winceham and managed to sound hurt:
\end_layout

What do you mean you people?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We even know the bunny by name, but not you.
 My patience is spent!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and raised Encelados threateningly.
 Ned lowered her arm and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down now.
 What is your name, woodkin?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The woodkin looked at the sword's blade respectfully and then addressed
 Ned with a slight bow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My name is Hanultheofodor Trypthwifidyr.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned seemed to cringe at the thought of uttering the name fully, so he simply
 offered his hand and smile thinly but reassuringly.
 The woodkin obliged him somewhat awkwardly after noticing that everyone
 had their eyes fixed on him.
 As he shook hands with Ned, Lernea told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Take us to your leader!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would have sounded commanding and perhaps a little intimidating, if Lernea
 hadn't been petting the bunny with the flaming eyes with giggly excitement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They passed a series of crests and hills shrouded in ever thickening bush
 and trees.
 The tropical forest had indeed turned into a proper jungle, full of mangroves
 and palm trees, thick grub and lush flower plants blocking their way.
 `Theo', which was how the rest had chosen to call Hanultheofodor for practical
 purposes knew the terrain well enough to avoid the thicker parts, but occasiona
ly had to sue his machete to cut a path through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their progress was just as slow as before; Parcifal had dubbed it half-man
 pace, and Winceham had insisted on at least calling it a halfuin pace for
 the sake of proper interspecies etiquette.
 He had quietened down soon afterward though when he became acutely aware
 that being so short and therefore close to the jungle bedfloor was disadvtageou
s at best, after he had stepped on a snake thicker than his arm and longer
 than imagination allowed for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snake had been easily dealt with a chop from Parcifal's blade.
 She had said that Winceham owed her one and even placed a bet that he'd
 owe her more further down the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the woodkin village still out of view, Parcifal and Theo were leading
 the way.
 Encelados was drawn in her hand should anything surprise them; she had
 balked at the idea of using her blade as a grass-cutter.
 Even Lernea admonished she had only once seen her sister so frightfully
 indignant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked silently, taking care not to step on something that could bite
 back, each one lost in thought for their own reasons.
 At length, Theo asked Parcifal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So none of them followed you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

None that we could see, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which reminds me, I have to ask: How could your sister see me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal found the question inexplicable but her blinking stare failed to
 convey that feeling to Theo.
 He waited for an answer, smiling affably, while the only thing Parcifal
 could conjure in words was:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that a question? You really want to know how my sister could see you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course! Counterspelling an illusionist's Ethereal Trance is a remarkable
 feat for someone not versed in the art of Choujou,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and Parcifal raised an eyebrow.
 She was beginning to suspect their guide had thought he was invisible from
 some weird reason that might or might not include an unreasonable amount
 of dreamhops or fuddlegrass, just like the kind Winceham had shared with
 her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are the illusionist you refer to I'd wager?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Indeed.
 Are you familiar with the Choujou school of magic?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not really, no,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a weary voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ah, its tradition goes back thousands of years.
 The ever-grazing mist of time has long ago obscured its deepest secrets,
 but my people have preserved its legacy and the source of its real power,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he cut a thick, rich cluster of foliage with a few chops of
 his machete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was suddenly intrigued at the mention of the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

secrets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

power
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

my people
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The thought came to her that perhaps Ned had been right to convince them
 to seek the Woodkin.
 If of course the rest of Theo's kin had a firm grasp of this witchcraft
 he talked about.
 Because it was her informed opinion that the young woodkin elf was a bit
 lightheaded to put it mildly.
 She had no idea what to make of his peculiar animal companion though, unless
 it were stew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo hopped in and out of the ground, the flames in his eyes lighting up the
 path ahead with a warm orange light.
 The bunny would at times pause, stoop high and shoot the party a glance
 before burrowing in the ground, only to appear a couple of minutes later
 down the path as suddenly as it had disappeared.
 But it never strayed away from Theo for too long.
 And that had got Winceham's attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See it? There, and there again.
 It just keeps doing that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham to Ned with a raspy, aggravated voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's just a bunny, Winceham.
 Leave it be.
 There are far worse things that may roam about.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It keeps staring at me at the oddest of times, Ned.
 I swear.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just your imagination, Winceham.
 It's been a long, difficult night and it's only a couple of hours until
 dawn breaks.
 Your eyes are playing tricks, that's all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

What about its eyes, Ned? Hm? What about those flaming eyes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like he said, it's some condition or other.
 I've heard of stranger things, of wild beasts that will turn you into stone,

 A rabbit with flaming eyes doesn't sound all that dangerous.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I recall yourself telling such morbid tales of fascinating creatures, Winceham.
 Could this be another fantasy of yours?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham made a gesture of acceptance with both hands and replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, I may have from time to time exaggerated concerning some of my former
 adventures especially where women were mentioned, but it was merely in
 order to put some polish in the boring details.
 This though, this rabbit.
 It has its eye on me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stopped then and took Winceham by the shoulder.
 His look was grim, his voice unusually stern and cold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've invoked Nadragatea on you, Winceham.
 This is one tale you'll have to follow to the end, you know that.
 Don't just pretend; your life depends on this as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham looked instantly and genuinely hurt; his eyes searched Ned's face
 for the young lad he'd come to known as he had grown into as much as a
 friend as his father.
 He saw little of that boy there.
 Instead, he was looking at a strong-willed man, indeed more than the boy's
 father had ever been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're right laddie, I'm full of it.
 Sometimes.
 I'm just saying, I don't like that bunny one bit, that's all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded with an understanding look.
 He motioned them to move on again even as Lernea caught up with them from
 behind, where she had been scouting from the last hilltop they had climbed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing for as far as I could see.
 Noone is on our trail.
 If someone's out this far to get us, they're probably lost someplace or
 coming at us from a totally different direction.
 No lights, torches or lamps of any kind as far as I could see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, a little short on breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't know what to expect with Hobb.
 It does make sense though; they sent a mob after us, but we weren't there.
 As long as we're gone, Hobb will have the Sniggering Pig anyway.
 As far as he's concerned, we've turned tail and ran, never to show our
 faces again,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned told Lernea, who in turn asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about the ape-man? Won't that man, Culliper, seek revenge for his comrade?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Culliper?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cut in Winceham with a snorting laughter full of disbelief and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sea-maggot is a slave-driver, pure and simple.
 The only thing he cares about is his hide and his loot.
 For the right coin, Culliper could be working for anyone.
 Though I hear those ape-men are hard to come by, I wouldn't worry about
 Culliper.
 Not until we meet him on our own terms.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded in agreement.
 He had a bitter, austere look carved across his face when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You leave Culliper to me when the time comes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When the time comes, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Winceham with rare sombreness.
 Lernea was about to ask something when she saw her sister up a few dozen
 yards up ahead signal a message with her hands.
 Parcifal had stooped low, her gaze searching for something through the
 night.
 What made Lernea nick an arrow though was Encelados' faint glow; the glow
 became stronger with every passing moment.
 She signaled back at Parcifal who acknowledged with a simple nod and reigned
 in Theo's mouth with her free hand.
 It seemed like the woodkin had a very vague idea of danger as something
 that could only affect other people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A faint hope of Winceham being mistaken in his assumption that something
 was amiss sprung up inside him.
 He felt he had to ask:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The sword's glowing? Is that normal?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She simply shook her head and without turning her head replied:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Something evil lurks nearby.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned fed a bolt in his crossbow and readied it, even as Winceham drew his
 stiletto and headed off amidst the thick brush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned with urgency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll scout around.
 Need to make myself sparse if I am to strike from the shadows, lad.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a moonless night, there's shadows everywhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned sounding confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Exactly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and nodded to Lernea who afforded him a small grin.
 Within a few moments he had melded into the shadows that abounded as if
 he'd never really been there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How did he do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Lernea to Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a thief,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned as they warily made their way closer to Parcifal and Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Retired,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she hissed and Ned simply grinned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Makes for a thin alibi in some lands,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he replied and Lernea shook her head.
 As they approached Parcifal, they saw her making furious hand signals;
 her face was almost obscured in shadow but they could make out her face
 taut with bone-breaking intensity.
 The hand signals were confused, hasty; Lernea couldn't make out what her
 sister was trying to tell her in silence.
 She shook her head and waved her to repeat, while Ned was right beside
 her, aiming his crossbow at a thick patch of utter blackness that seemed
 most inviting for something that lurked out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then noticed the bunny was looking straight at him, the flames from his
 eyes having died down to crackling embers.
 The bunny curled its tiny lips into an impossible grin just for Ned alone
 to see and hurriedly burrowed inside the ground the next instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed to sigh even as Encelados began to glow fiercely, casting
 harrowing shadows of Parcifal and Theo around the thick brush.
 Parcifal repeated her message but to no avail; Lernea shook her head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is she trying to say?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's either large flying beast lurking on the treetops or mythical magical
 beast wandering up ahead, I can't tell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned swallowed hard at that; he couldn't understand what the difference in
 the quality of the information imparted was, so he simply asked, his voice
 trembling slightly, hinting of mounting tension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How is one, better news than the other?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not much of a difference.
 It's just that I claim flying kills first, while Parcifal claims the land-dwell
ers,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said matter-of-factly as she signalled her sister they were going to
 rush within whispering distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, is that true? What happens if it's a sea creature, or something that
 lives underground?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked ironically, surprised at the nonchalance of Lernea, as well as
 in himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coin toss,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as the irony was lost on her and nearly dragged Ned alongside
 her as they sprinted to cover the dstance between Parcifal and them.
 Their feet shuffled over the thick boggy floorbed as they crouched low.
 When they were in earshot, Parcifal turned around and whispered to her
 sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I said, it's a bleeding flying lizard!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Theo managed to answered promptly when he finally pushed Parcifal's
 hand aside.
 Completely heedless of the need to remain as silent as possible, he made
 sure to stand up in order to deliver his point more acutely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's utterly absurd! It's not a lizard, that's a dragonkin pure and simple.
 It is a fairly easy mistake though, since-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo was cut mid-sentence as a loud screeching noise like a sad, horrific
 wail was quickly followed by the figure of a muscular, nine-foot tall lizard-li
ke creature swooping down from the treetops towards them.
 A set of unnervingly sharp-looking claws the size of short curvy blades
 extended from its feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get down you muttering fool!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and thrust herself on Theo, bringing him down even as Ned shot
 his crossbow reflexively.
 Ned's shot missed wildly, unlike Parcifal.
 Timing her thrust, Encelados met with the creature's belly as it tried
 to leap upwards again, to hide in the lush canopy or have another go at
 them at its leisure.
 That was no longer possible, as Parcifal's blade brought it down after
 a couple of yards thrashing, wailing its high-pitched death throes in anguish,
 blood gushing freely from a lengthy wound, the creature's ghastly innards
 freely exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal quickly walked over to the dying creature and stood above it as
 it laid there, dying meekly.
 Theo exclaimed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I protest! That dragonkin-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea could not resist the urge; she slapped him across the face and said
 to his face frozen in disbelief:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's for being an idiot.
 You can thank me for saving your life later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Theo tried to force his mouth to make audible sounds form into a semblance
 of speech, Parcifal held Encelados shoulder high and said ceremoniously:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unto the abyssal chasm I comment thee, beast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She swung Encelados down sharply and the creature's head came off its neck
 clean, like a slice of fruit.
 The pool of blood around its lifeless body was already beginning to clog,
 while the cut below the head was almost clean dry.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a mischievous look, underlined by a
 gleeful grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's one more for me, sister.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea bit back a reproachful answer:

You had no right for first kill! That's bad etiquette and certainly cheating!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo swallowed hard and managed to regain a measure of composure.
 He laid himself down near the creature, muttering mostly to himself:

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters heard that and paused to wonder even as Parcifall shot a look
 at Encelados.
 It was indeed glowing, blindingly bright.
 They exchanged knowing worried looks when suddenly Winceham burst forth
 from the nearby tall grass running with all the speed his stature and years
 allowed.
 He shouted something indelible to the others without turning around to
 look, and lost himself through another thick bush behind the crest of a
 ravine.

What did he say? Something about a rat and tip?

 the flames from its eyes whirling in a blinding fashion.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo and then suddenly a trio of bipedal mushrooms holding iron spears
 and using their tops as shields came out of the thick grass running awkwardly,
 exchanging long-winded moaning sounds and pointing at Theo and the rest
 agressively, judging by the way the spears faced towards the group.

I'd say he's more into greens, for sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a shake of her head and rushed the warrior-mushrooms
 head on, whirling Encelados with wild abandon.
 Ned was looking at the scene in front of him as if it were only a dream;
 he had a sudden epiphany then and told Theo who was waving his hands about
 him in a ridiculously complicated manner in preparation for a spell:
\end_layout

Did you hear the joke about the fungus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

No, what joke?

I could tell you now, but it might need time to grow on you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and grinned while Theo stood pondering as his hands filled with
 a shiny, blue ball of crackling energy.
 Ned let a bolt fly straight through the mouth of a raging mushroom-warrior
 which plucked half its head off.
 Lernea was reloading her bow after her first arrow got stuck on a cap,
 and Parcifal poised Encelados for yet another slash at the mushroom directly
 in front of her, expertly avoiding its thrusts and hacking it to death
 with a few strokes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo shook with hearty laughter, at the same time hurtling the ball of lightning
 at a mushroom charging Lernea albeit with a spurious gait.
 The mushroom promptly exploded into a cloud of charred dust, fleshy bits
 of what used to form its torso flying around.
 The smell of burning fungi permeated the air.
 Parcifal made sure Encelados wasn't glowing any more before saying triumphantly
:

Ned ignored the comment on his abilities as a marksman and walked over the

Theo sounded deliriously giggly, barely able to make sense when he said:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled thinly but pretty soon the smile vanished when Bo the Bunny reemerged
 in front of him and smiled uncannily wide.
 Ned had another flash and asked everyone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is Winceham?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And only the bunny knew that Winceham was still running through brush and
 wood, over the bog and marsh, muttering incoherently:

Bad trip, it's a bad trip's what it is, bad trip, that's all it is..

* * *
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal had apologised to Theo, but he still looked moody; he kept Bo the
 Bunny by his side everytime.
 Curiously enough, the usually rampant bunny obliged him.
 It was as if the animal could sense Theo's loss and sympathized; which
 wasn't the weirdest thing considering it was a bunny with flames writhing
 out of its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea and Ned had found Winceham inside a pool of slimy bog water, drenched
 in muck.
 They had a hard time convincing him that the mushroom warriors were real
 enough to end up dead.
 Winceham had told them he'd quit, but he had to clarify that he didn't
 mean that he'd quit the group.
 After exchanging a few puzzled looks, they were back on the trail to Theo's
 village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crack of dawn was upon them when the saw thick plumes of smoke rise
 up into the sky behind the last crest they had to pass in order to reach
 the village.
 Theo smiled brightly for the first time since his steed had been slain:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh! They must be preparing a feast! That's never happened before!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The others exchanged knowing looks.
 Clouds of smoke usually meant that in the very unlikely event of a feast,
 something had gone terribly wrong.
 They hadn't the heart to tell Theo; he'd soon find out.
 Ned almost growled, his anger starting to boil his blood once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hobb.
 Damn his name and soul.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Winceham, who had dried up by then, sighed and added:

This changes things for the worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 while the sisters looked at the smoke with heavy, sombre frowns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If this really is Hobb's doing, it's no longer a matter of debt, pride,

 This is the work of evil; it must be cleansed,

 said Parcifal and Lernea agreed with a nod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skrala, we swear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and carried onwards, beside Theo, his reality distorted by his
 naive, though well-mannered demeanor.
 Lernea looked at him with pity; his eyes met hers and his smile made her
 avert her gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Theo asked her and stopped as they had began to slowly climb the last hill.
 The other passed them by in silence on their way to the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was reminded of my home, suddenly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea and found a reassuring core of truth to her words.
 An icy feeling of loneliness crept up her; the terrible image of Nomos
 burning in her mind made her shudder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you cold, or maybe sick?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Theo disarmingly.
 He looked genuinely worried.
 Lernea held a tear with some effort and told him while she gently pushed
 him up the slope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry, that's all, Theo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She shook her head and smiled thinly, as they walked the last few feet in
 silence.
 The other were already on the top, casting long shadows on the foliage.
 The sank had barely lifted above the green treetops, yet a warm light embraced
 their faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About Vulsek? It was an accident,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said without conviction.
 He was still trying to come to grips with that.
 When they reached the top, they saw the village below, fires still consuming
 houses and trees alike.
 Theo's jaw dropped in an instant, Bo always by his side, the flames in
 his eyes dying down suddenly.
 Lernea touched Theo's hand gently and told him in an almost broken voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry about your village.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words failed him.
 He sank to his knees on the ground, as if the last iota of strength had
 left him.
 Winceham put a hand around his shoulder and said nothing.
 Ned looked with mounting anger at the burning village, his eyes wndering
 aimlessly as if trying to comprehend.
 The crackle of fire reached them with ominous clarity.
 Trees had burned to a cinder, leaving nothing but ashes and smouldering
 stumps behind them.
 Wooden bridges laid in ruins, half-eaten by the flames, the houses at the
 top of the trees burning away like candles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun came up, its first rays lost in the glow of the fires.
 It was an unruly sight, but noone looked away; each one of them was lost
 in their own thoughts.
 Theo finally broked down in tears, a tender sob taking him over.
 Bo turned his head and his nose wrinkled; his whiskers twitched and his
 eyes lit up with a subdued flame before he ran down the hill, stopped and
 turned to look straight at Ned.
 He hopped a couple of times before running down again, towards the village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He wants us to follow him.
 Could he have smelled something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned and set out after the bunny.
 Parcifal shrugged a little and followed close by, while Winceham told Theo
 with a gentle voice, almost a whisper:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll get him laddie.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo managed to stem the tears, and said flatly, his eyes lost somewhere
 beyond the burning trees:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No evil deed goes unpunished, Theo,

 Winceham shot her a troubled look and said:

To which she replied sternly:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo staggered at first, then wiped his eyes with his robe, stifling another
 sob as they slowly walked downhill.
 The fire was still consuming the trees and houses, but it had mostly died
 down where it had met the rather soggy, dense forest around the grove where
 the village had once stood.
 What was left of it, was burning slowly like candle wax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny was standing on a well at the village's entrance.
 It was hopping and bouncing around like driven suddenly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Bo's found someone!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Theo and ran to the well.
 Parcifal was looking at the edge of the village warily; she could not escape
 a feeling of danger.
 Winceham hunched low and put his senses to good use, while Lernea asked
 Ned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Could Hobb have done this? Burned a whole village? Why would he do that?

I'm not sure.

 Lernea looked around and said knowingly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There are no bodies.
 There's no smell of charred flesh either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Winceham turned around and told them, rubbing his fingers full of dirt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's because they took everyone.
 At least two dozen strong, deep tracks all over the place.
 Heavy armor.
 There are no traces of a fight; there's a strange, faint smell of iron
 though.

 said Theo as he helped an elder-looking woodkin climb out of the well.
 His plain robes were smudged and stained with soot, his face was dark.
 Grizzly long dreadlocks adorned his head, where a wooden circlet sat.
 The Elder smiled copiously as he sat down on the ground, obviousy exhausted.

 asked Theo with a furrowed brow as he helped Fingammon to his flask of

 The Elder waved the flask away and looked at Parcifal in the eyes.
 His voice had a strange, gravely quality.
 It was hoarse and he talked in a drawn out, strangely exotic way.

 Lernea was now staring at the woodkin fiercely.

 Parcifal shook her head and sheathed Encelados.

 He didn't share her opinion:

There are strange things in this world.

My sister and I are scions bred to rule, halfuin.

The lad speaks the truth.
 Devious things, but their masters are the ones that control them.

If they're made of iron, that would explain the strong scent.

 I've only sailed with those that float on water.

 A large crystal sat inside a gold girder.
 The crystal shone with iridescent colours and the girder was covered in

 Theo looked at it with a sudden rush of curiosity.
 He felt inexplicably drawn to it, somehow.

 her sister asked in a hushed voice as Theo led the way, Fingammon wearily
 trudging along by his side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Bo popped up from beneath the ground, right in front of her feet.
 He looked at her with eyes glowing hot as embers, before grinning widely
 and burrowing itself down again.
 A moment later it popped up right behind Theo, and followed him close by,
 happily hopping around him playfully, the flames around his eyes twirling
 like a torch at night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal answered her own question before Lernea could answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Never mind that.

 she said and fell in line, Ned and Winceham close behind them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a cloudy, hazy morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Part Three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was on watch.
 He hadn't really slept in that cave all that well; the physical exertion
 made his muscles ache but his troubled mind couldn't rest, and so he fidgeted
 nervously, never really getting a proper rest.
 Dark thoughts wrestled in his mind, and the need for revenge made his stomach
 churn and his heart thump mightily in his chest.
 He looked at the cloudy sky from the lip of the cave, his fingers gently
 caressing his drum, his sole posession in the world and the last thing
 he loved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo couldn't sleep either; the realisation that almost his whole life he
 had been lied to, even if it was in everyone's best interest, was impossible
 to fathom.
 A lot of things were impossible for Theo to fathom actually, but this one
 in particular stung like hell.
 To top it off, there was noone of his people to talk to other than the
 elder, who having fully explained to him how he came to find him one day
 in the wounds, he fell asleep, the years on his back and the exhaustion
 from the ordeal with Hobb's raid exerting their toll on the old woodkin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo kept to himself, never uttering a word.
 He sat with his legs crossed, his eyes unable to part with the vista of
 his village burned to the ground.
 Little clouds of smoke still gathered above it, but the fires had been
 extinguished by that time, after having eating almost everything, leaving
 little for the eye to see that at one time, people lived there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned watched Theo as he had lost himself in thought.
 He had a sudden realisation then: if it wasn't for the ears and the bunny,
 it felt to him that he was watching himself.
 They had both lost their homes, and Theo had never met his parents; in
 a way, that was worse than what Ned was going through.
 At least he had the memories.
 But Theo, thought Ned, all he had was a bunny and an amulet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not easy, is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned.
 Theo did not look at him, but simply remained silent, gazing outwards into
 the sky.
 Ned walked over him, and sat himself down on the bedrock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My father was murdered last night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said.
 The words spurred Theo.
 He looked thoughtful when he said softly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry for your loss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded and spent a moment or so watching Theo.
 The bunny was with him always it seemed.
 Just holding him seemed to be important to Theo.
 The flames on Bo's eyes were a mere prickle of light; he looked content.
 It kept looking at Theo as if he knew things were hard for him.
 Ned thought it wasn't impossible for a flame-eyed rabbit to know that.
 It didn't take an expert in magical beasts to realise it when Bo looked
 at them funny.
 This was one such time.
 Theo noticed the look Bo shot ned, ears pointed eagerly upright, the prickles
 of light in its eyes brightening up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down Bo.
 He's not bad.
 The bad men are out there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo with a grittiness that his youthful, woodkin appearance belied.
 Ned spoke to him earnestly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what you're feeling.
 That would be a lie.
 But you haven't slept, and I couldn't do that either.
 I don't know if it's normal.
 But I'm not feeling tired.
 Sure, the legs hurt a bit, but that's not the real pain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned let his words trail off awkwardly, remembering what had happened just
 the night before.
 He suppressed a tear and feeling somewhat embarassed, looked the other
 way.
 They sat in relative silence for a few moments, interrupted by the far-away
 chirping of birds and Winceham's occasional saw-like snore.
 Theo broke the silence then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What was your father like?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ned's face scrounged up in while he tried to find the words.
 He put on a slightly sly smile and said:

Ned's brow furrowed but not unkindly; it was simply the fact that Theo couldn't

 It gave being around him an interesting flair.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Theo had an understanding look in his eyes.
 He pouted his lips slightly and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That sounds..
 Well, awful.
 At least, I never knew my real parents.

 I never thought I was..
 Found,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he swallowed hard and let his voice trail off, his head lowered
 moodily.
 A smile crept up on Ned's face.
 Theo's naivety was bordering on stupidity, as Parcifal would have it, but
 in his mind, Ned saw a child in a man's body, and that somehow reminded
 him of himself.
 What was more, he felt that didn't bother him at all.

 The bunny smiled back uncannily for only Theo to see.
 Ned replied truthfully:

 Theo looked at him with a wide, gentle smile, accented by the way its edges
 led to his long, pointy ears:

I know it's a little hard to play most omens, prophecies and tales with

 Maybe if more bards got together and everyone played a different instrument,
 I could be, you know, supporting their music with beating the drum.
 And then we could tour, get the crowd rolling.
 It could be amazing,

 said Ned with childish excitement overrunning his voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I don't want to put you off, but that sounds all wrong.
 I mean, who would want to see the same bards over and over again? And everyone

 Come to think of it, how do you play notes on that thing? I don't see any
 keys, strings or pipes,

 said Theo without thinking about it all, his disarmingly blunt earnesty
 firing Ned up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It doesn't have notes! It does have values though! And it needs tuning as

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Ned with a sudden pang of mild anger and the bunny's eyes gave
 off a burst of flame as Bo turned and looked at him with a twitchy nose.
 Theo simply spoke his mind when he next said:

And then they both heard a loud squawk-like sound echoing from the inside

 Bo's eyes flared up when the sound turn into a growl.

More advice, Wince? It doesn't always work, I'm afraid,

 Ned said and didn't bother to look at the halfuin.
 Winceham realised Ned was probably still blaming mostly him for what happened

 He'd try and talk it out of him, if he didn't know Ned all too well.
 He simply changed the subject:

Ned was busy searching for the men who had disembarked from the flying ship.
 He had seen at least a couple of them, along with ape-men, and what must've
 been the Hound Fingammon had heard mention of.
 Still, as they waded through the bush, approaching Hobb's search party
 with care, he once more explained to the noble princess why she and her
 sister, the Queen by right, were wearing a large bear-skin covering up
 their gear, pretending to be a two-headed freak:

 Ned's idea of diversionary tactics:

 Lernea protested:

The Hound,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said with a feeling of awe and mounting anger as his eyes could not
 peel away from the three-headed canine, abnormally large, its skin sleek-black
 like the darkest of nights.
 Behind the pirate search party, the silhouette of the ship bobbed lazily
 in the air a hundred feet or so behind them, right at the treetops.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alright,

 the taught bearskin that covered all three of them like an oversized coat.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Try to clap along the sound of my beat.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned and started off with a drum roll, his red drum strapped in place
 in front of him, his tinglewood sticks a gift from his father.
 His voice echoed wildly as he sung at the top of his lungs, alongside the
 merry beat of his drum:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's men heard them before they could see them.
 One of the Hound's head's sniffed the air vigorously, while another turned
 and looked sideways at the Ned and the others as they tried to dance about
 to the tune, the sisters and Winceham having a real problem standing upright
 while their dance looked more like a drunken balancing act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ape-men grinned broadly at the spectacle, while the bucaneers had the
 uneasy expression of someone meeting an odd, crazy-looking person on his
 doorstep asking to use the facilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned kept at the song as they got closer at a walking pace, and Theo performed
 a sort of light show, sprinkling shiny dust and even Bo added his flaming
 eyes to performance, hopping eagerly.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned exchanged looks sideways with Theo.
 The ape-men where clapping their hands and jiggling their heads in tune
 with the beat of Ned's drum, while the bucaneer men pointed a couple of
 fingers and stares at the two-headed freak thinking that the six-legged
 weirdo was supposed to be the dancing lead, seeing that the drummer and
 the clown were busy with their own act.
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the Hound had its six eyes all set on Bo; the
 beast looked tense, its lean muscles taut on edge.
 They were now no more than ten yards away, and Ned was banging away a joyous
 beat, his voice smiling through the air:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
The two-headed freak that were the sisters and Winceham in disguise tried
 to clap his hands together on tune but rarely managed to do so.
 It rather seemed to punch its belly vigorously, both heads smiling brightly
 as it did so.
 Winceham's muffled agony at the hands of the sisters was obfuscated by
 Ned's singing and drum act, while Theo's cantrips had even attracted the
 gaze of the wary bucaneers who were tapping their boots in tune.
 The ape-men had put down their blunderbusses and were dancing, arm-in-arm.
 The Hound though, kept trained at Bo, who was happily doing somersaults
 in the air, a flaming rainbow of orange light trailing him.
 Ned entered into a circle around the group of Hobb's men, and into the
 final verse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
Ned' voice trailed off and he ventured a somewhat nervous look at Theo.
 The ape-men staggered as the banging of the drum stopped, and one of the
 bucaneers asked showing a set of teeth that looked like a puzzle badly
 missing its pieces:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 came Winceham's muffled cry from within the belly of the two-headed freak
 and one of the ape-men was instantly overjoyed:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the sisters shed the bearskin with one fluid motion, revealing
 their armor and weapons underneath with Winceham in the middle, a rather
 pointed dagger in one hand and a wild-eyed grin on his face.
 Theo side-stepped Ned and passed him the crossbow he had tucked under his
 robes.
 Hobb's men were fiddling with the flintlocks on their guns, gnarly looks
 of surprise on their weather-torn faces; their dropped jaws denoted dental
 hygiene was probably a pirate's worst fear.
 The ape-men asked the pirates bewildered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is this part o' the troupe's act?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the pirate had the chance to retort with a curse as vile as his breath,
 Ned's bolt had buried itself in his head.
 The other ape-man looked at Ned with a cocked eyebrow and asked even as
 his hand reached for the cutlass at his cloth belt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Winceham and with a jolt and a tumble right beside the men, he
 reached under the large ape as he was about to have a go at Ned and Theo.
 Winceham gave the ape-man a quick stab in one leg; blood sprouted and the
 large brute growled in pain as his animal self took over.
 The pirates were only a pace away from the sisters who freed of the constrainin
g bearskin, truly danced to an inner beat.
 the pirates' blunderbasses let off their leaden shots with a thundering
 boom and a plume of smoke and sparks.
\end_layout

 said Mr.
 Jessums and jogged the other pirate's shoulder.
 When he gave him a look though, he became morbidly aware that the man's
 head had been chopped off clean.
 And a feet away stood Parcifal, with Encelados in her hand, grinning at
 the pirate broadly.
 A few feet behind him, Lernea showed off her skills with the bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 she cried and let loose a fistful of arrows headed for the ape-man at point-bla

 Sadly though, they missed since the growling ape charged at Theo with his
 cutlass coming down from way up high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do something Theo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Ned as he struggled to reload his crossbow, his drum getting in the
 way.
 It was all a matter of moments; Theo laid there helpless, his hands unable
 to produce anything other than a trembling motion.
 His senses had nothing good in stock for him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was nicking an arrow, and Parcifal was exchanging blows with the
 remaining pirate.
 He could hear Winceham cursing as he rushed behind the ape once more, but
 he was far too slow.
 And Bo..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where is Bo? thought Theo and as he lay there frozen his vision filled with
 a rabbit smiling at him in an uncanny human fashion; Bo leapt in the air,
 swung his head around, and shot a pair of small fireballs at the charging
 ape, who was instantly engulfed in flames.
 His body came down crashing, writhing in flames, while Theo saw the Hound
 zip past him, ignoring him completely as it was after Bo with a pace that
 its size belied.
 Its three heads shot cones of fire, lightning and acid as it ran after
 Bo, charring the ground, plantlife fizzing away in the path it carved behind
 Bo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo shouted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with pained affection and worry and ran after the hound heedless of the
 danger.
 Winceham stuck his dagger into the charred remains of the ape-man with
 a wild cheer, while Encelados' clangs came to an end when Parcifal expertly
 nicked his cutlass away from him and brought her blade against his bare
 neck.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yield!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she cried.
 The pirate glimpsed at Encelados, licked his lips anxiously and said nodding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and her bow shuddered as an arrow flew away.
 It struck the Hound at one of its necks, and made it give pause to the
 chase.
 The head where the arrow had struck soon fell limp as it died - the other
 two ventured to pierce the clouds atop the sky with their howlings, and
 growling, turned about and charged straight at Lernea.
 Hurtling past a bewildered Theo, the Hound swerved around Ned's bolt and
 shot him a glancing shot of deadly acid breath.
 Fortunately his drum got in the way, and promptly began to melt away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 cried Lernea to Parcifal as she nicked two arrows in her bow this time.
 The Hound was closing in damnably fast; a shot of acid went wide of its
 mark, while a bolt of lightning knocked Winceham off his feet, and threw
 him down with a thud that didn't match the halfuin's size.
 Ned was reloading his crossbow, while Theo was still running after Bo,
 nearly lost in the thick bush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the hound's heads growled ferociously and prepared to leap at Lernea,
 there were no more than a few yards between them.
 It was Parcifal who dropped on her knees suddenly in front of the hound,
 hunched behind the family shield: Erymanthos.
 The Hound clashed on the shield with all its might and a terrible raucous;
 Parcifal was thrown on her side wildly, while the Hound bucked and leapt
 on the air without any control, rolling happlessly.
 As it fell down on the earth only a few feet away from Lernea, it was still
 trying to stand on its feet when two arrows struck true right between its
 heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without so much as a squeak, it passed away.
 It's death cry was replaced by a cannon shot flaring hot right above everyone's
 heads; the red-hot cannonball cut down a swath of trees with a pompous
 thud and loud creak.
 Winceham mumbled curses between deep moaning sounds while Ned caught a
 man reloading a cannon from the corner of his eye.
 He turned around and looked; it was Culliper.
 Ned overflowed with rage suddenly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Lernea afforded him a cursory look.

 she cried to Lernea, who nodded and picked up the shield as she went.

The cannon on the prow of the ship was manned by Culliper alone and his
 element of surprise was gone.
 He yelled menacingly:

Ya land-ridden scallywags, I know yer faces! Should've killed you when I

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then fired both his pistols, one aimed at Ned and the other at Lernea.
 Ned was running with the speed and grace of the wind; Culliper simply was
 too slow to aim and the bullet went zipping past, blowing chunks of wetwood
 out of a nearby tree.
 But his other bullet struck Lernea true with an ominous metal clang, and
 felled her to the ground.

How's that for starters, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he yelled with a broad, maddened grin which promptly vanished when he saw

Pesky little foreign critters! You'll be hanging from the main mast naught

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 yelled Culliper with a fist and started reloading his pistols mumbling
 curses under his breath with a jittering voice.
 The smell of something burning drew his attention and then noticed the
 smell was intense.
 Combined with a burning sensation, it made him realise his hat was on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He threw it on the deck with a panicky motion and stomped on it.
 He then realised a bunny with flaming eyes was grinning at him, perched
 on a barrel of grog that so happens to be flammable.

Now lookit here a bunny with flaming eyes.

 he said as he licked his lips and calmly aimed at Bo.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper cocked the flintlock but before he could pull the trigger, a fist
 connected sharply with his face and sent his head spinning and him staggering
 like a pirate on shore leave.
 Before he had time to recover, another one sent him sprawling on the deck.
 It was Ned, trembling with hate as the man who killed his father laid helpless
 before him.
 He looked at him with a viciousness that marred his benign face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

No, Ned, wait! Don't!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea as she climbed on to the deck.
 She still clutched Erymanthos, its upper lip torn, a large sunken hole
 prominent near the Nomos crest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper looked at them with surprise and stubborness mixed in equal parts.
 For a passing moment, Culliper thought about upstaging everyone and by
 a feat of nimbleness pick up his pistols and shoot the meddling pests dead.
 But his pragmatism overcame him, along with his basic cowardice, and laying
 on his back he begged for his life:

No, please! Listen to her, Ned! If I heard her correctly, that is.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ned picked up a loaded pistol nonetheless and aimed at it squarely at Culliper.
 He then told Lernea with pain in his voice, the pistol in his hand trembling
 with frail determination:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me a real good reason not to pull this trigger, Queen of Nomos.
 I'd expect you'd understand.
 Or do you expect me to adhere to the sanctity of life, even a maggot's
 like this one? Will this scar me for life? I'm already scarred, Lernea.
 Nothing good will come of this, you might say.
 I care for naught.
 It's him, and Hobb.
 This one pulled the trigger; Hobb sucked my father's life out of him.
 So tell me, good Queen, one good reason not to.

Bloody well do tell him! You won't believe how hard it is to get brains

Lernea looked long and hard at Ned; her stare had a calming effect.
 She sighed and said promptly:

 said Lernea and shifted slightly as she sat on the ship's deck, mindful
 of the way the others, and especially Winceham, stared at her sister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her efforts to reprimand Parcifal were for naught; she still munched away
 blissfully even after everyone had filled their bellies thoroughly.
 She had gathered a small cornucopia in front of her, including a leg of
 smoked ham, a head of almost-gone-bad cheese and all sorts of sweetbreads
 and sour pancakes, along with a bulging fruitbasket and an amphora of sweet
 red wine.
 The ship's galley had been recently stocked to the brim, as if in preparation
 for a long journey.

 Ned shot him a grinning look:

You should've seen how you dug in that salami and pork pie.

 Winceham counterpointed, waving a finger as he spoke:

Ned sighed.
 He knew Winceham was overprotective, mostly of himself:

Halfuin skin is very sensitive; it could be months before I'm fit for action

Right.
 Do keep an eye though when the tower is in sight.
 We can't trust him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and walked away, towards the ship's bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham nodded and his gaze returned to the horizon.
 There was still nothing in sight that resembled Hobb's Keep or Chuck's
 Point, the northern cape's ridge where the keep stood.
 Below the ship, an otherwise unassuming, common pirate sloop that could
 nonetheless literally fly, a hazy tapestry of green passed by in tranquility.
 To port, one could barely make out Hobb's Bay in the distance, while to
 starboard a sea of rolling jungle hills seemed to go on forever.
 And behind them, somewhere beyond the haze and the fog stood the remains
 of the woodkin village, where Fingammon prayed to Jah, waiting for his
 peoples' safe return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo kept a wary eye on Culliper who remained unequivocally silent, nursing
 the aching back of his head from time, shooting murderous stares at everyone
 once in a while.
 Everyone except Bo who stood watch high upon the mast.
 The bunny, for some reason known only to the two of them, made Culliper
 cringe and look away with a morose, even shameful expression.

Parcifal made common knowledge that she felt full with a loud burping noise,

What kind of shame would that be?

 slept soundly while Culliper stood on the helm, rigid like a rock, yet
 fretful like a virgin on her wedding night.

Lernea felt the woodkin intruding, his question a bit straightforward.
 Parcifal did not seem to think so and said with a playful grin and a raised
 brow:

My sister was Queen of Nomos for a day, when her dear new husband, King

Now's a good a time as any.

Why? Have you heard of any such rumour?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 It was evident in his voice that the thought of time stopping and perhaps

 Parcifal laughed, perceiving Theo was humoring her, while in fact, he was
 actually a bit worried.

Hah! For some, tomorrow will never come.
 And for those that meet us with the wrong intentions, that might still

 Her smile bristled with pride and ambition.

Lernea's retort came slyly, her eyes squinting at her sister:

Ned's shout gave pause to the sisters quarrel.
 Everyone turned their heads to have a look-see while the neck of the ridge
 kept growing taller.
 Even Mr.
 Jessums moved his dead stare a bit, still strapped down the strange-looking
 contraption on the lowered part of the deck that resembled a chair.
 Arguably it was a most sinister chair that according to Culliper, sucked
 the life force of its occupant in order for the ship to fly.
 Winceham had called the premise `a haybag full of excrement' but his own
 personal experience of sitting on it caused him to squirm away at the sight
 of it the moment they managed to pull him off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Winceham as he saw the base of the keep rise through a multi-layered
 fog.
 At the very tip of the cape, it was a huge oblong stone-brick construct,
 it's wide walls situated as to cover with their cannon and balistae both
 Hobb's bay, as well as the ocean.
 It rose formidably above the clouds.
 Ned and the others joined in a rough circle:
\end_layout

Alright, get ready everyone.
 We'll land on top of the tower where's there supposed to be an anchorage,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Theo will keep an eye on the ship and him.

Theo reiterated the steps with his fingers, albeit with some difficulty.
 Bo nudged him in the foot with its nose, and he tucked him away promptly

Lernea stood silent by her side, while eyeing Ned with a calm yet demanding

 He was indecisive for a moment; he sighed before telling them:
\end_layout

Find him.

 Ned returned the salute, shaking both of their hands heartily.

 He was dumbfounded enough to be unable to find the words while his mouth

It was then that the ship pulled out of the cloudscape, little whisps of
 cloud like smoke trailing her bow and hull, unwilling to let go for a moment.
 Arond them, a vast sea of rosy, mellow clouds stretched in every direction,
 as the sun began to die down in the horizon.

Ned brought her to bear against the top of Hobb's keep, growing closer with

 There seemed to be little activity going on; torches had not been lit yet.

\begin_layout Standard

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo and flexed his fingers.
 Everyone else readied their weapons as well, and hunched low to the sides
 of the ship.
 At the tower, an elevated wooden platform stood out, acting as a dock.
 It was supported on a wheeled scaffold.
 A sort of pulley arrangement was visible, and the whole dock seemed able
 to move, elevate and rotate with the help of some ropes and weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lookout had seen the ship approach, and was now standing on the platform,
 scratching his head, rearranging his hat and squinting his eyes.
 A scruffy-looking dog was barking non-stop.

Ahoy there! What took yer so long? I cannae see anyone.

 yelled the pirate and fell into a death-defying giggle that involved clearing
 up one's lungs and nose cavities thoroughly, yet not cleanly.
 He spat a greenish globule, the color of grog and the consistency of glue.
 Even the dog cared enough to move, flee-bitten and ridden with lice as
 it was.
 No answer came and Ned simply let the ship slide effortlessly sideways,
 the platform grazing the hull slightly:

A rope seemed to shoot off itself down to the tower, and Ned appeared suddenly
 and stepped on the platform, his crossbow in hand, aimed at the pirate.
 Lernea followed suit, an arrow nicked in her bow, while Parcifal simply
 unsheathed Encelados.
 The pirate was superbly equipped to deal with the situation at hand.

Winceham felt it was high time he asked someone before it was too late:

Anyone with some flint and steel? Something to light my pipe.
 I'm dying out here!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And seemingly out of nowhere, a burst of flame ignited the pipe in his hand
 thoroughly.
 Winceham turned around and saw Bo, peeking out of Theo's robes, and grinning
 at him uncannily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
***
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham and Ned had been silently climbing down the many storeys of the
 keep.
 Winceham was silent to a fault when he needed to; he scouted ahead and
 made sure the way was clear before Ned followed in his steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was for the most part, an wasy way in.
 There wasn't such as thing as patrols, but rather bands of merry pirates
 with a lot of time on their hands and little to do other than pissing and
 drinking contests, though not neccessarily in that exact order.
 A few rooms had pirates in the guise of guards posted outside who instead
 of guarding played craps or cards, usually with very lopsided results that
 ended in sharp instruments being used to clarify things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, all Winceham did was listen, watch and wait until Ned followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They hadn't ran onto anything especially interesting or dangerous; there
 was a vague hope the woodking would be held in the dungeons, but other
 than that the complete lack of noisy conundrums meant that the sisters
 were either brilliantly successful, or in grave danger.
 Winceham expressed that belief in a whisper, and Ned replied with almost
 a hiss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mayb they're waiting.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For what? Dinnertime?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham and scrounged his face.
 He was about to take another step forward and lead them another floor down
 when he heard a duo of pirates conversing casually as they came down a
 corridor to meet the staircase:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oy, how do we go about that then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said one, scratching his head under his hat, evidently befuddled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I suppose we ditch them in the pit and let the crocs do the rest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied the other with a shrug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, you see I was wondering, how do we push them inside the pit.
 I mean, there's like more than two of them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 insisted the somewhat not-so-bright-as-his colleague pirate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Boyo, you're right! How 'bout we kill'em first so they don't move about
 and all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the other with mock surprise and excitement which did not carry over
 as intented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dunno 'bout that, boss said feed them to crocs alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came the wavering answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he won't know the difference know, will he?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the other with a mischievous grin that could've been sparkling had
 more teeth been available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham nodded to Ned and then and casually appeared to them from behind
 the staircase wall:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it with you pirates and dental hygiene?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it one of them? What's it doin' up 'ere?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the pirate uneasily, while the other turned and replied with a frown
 of uncertainty:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, too short.
 Oy, boyo, stick'em!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the pirate and brandished a cutlass.
 To his surprise though, Winceham wasn't standing where he was supposed
 to be.
 Instead, he was now facing Ned's crossbow, and his rather dull partner
 had a stiletto sticking out of his gut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin, if you please?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and waved his bloodied stiletto menacingly.
 Ned kept the crossbow trained at the now glum-looking pirate, while he
 replied:

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

And I thought you were the brighter of the pair.

 said Winceham angrily, trying to keep his voice below a shout.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's going to far even for the likes of you, sirrah,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham with a snarl and felt a sudden urge to stab the pirate vehemently.
 Ned stayed his arm and asked the pirate:
\end_layout

What pigs?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Winceham urgently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the pirate with an ever more frightened, bewildered voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please, Ned.
 Let me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, his voice trembling from aggravation, an ill-tempered gleam
 in his eye and the stiletto swinging in his hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The jungle folk.
 Where are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned as calmly as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh, them you mean? Off-world with the last shipment!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The last shipment?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned and Winceham followed suit:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Off-world?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they heard a cry echo down the walls.
 And then another.
 They were high-pitched and sounded familiar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A woman's cries,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham under his breath and instinctively looked up, from where
 the sound came.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The sisters!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled Ned and ran up the staircase with all his might.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham said to the pirate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Duck.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the pirate with a scrounged up face, unable to understand and Winceham
 sighed and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never mind, too tall anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, tripped the pirate and sent him careening down the stairs with many sounds
 of broken bones, before him too, running up the staircase as fast as any
 halfuin could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
***
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The had ran up through the stairs and down corridors meeting little resistance.
 A couple of unlucky pirates had simply tried to see what the commotion
 was all about, and met a deadly, painful fate in the form of a bolt between
 the eyes and a stiletto in the nether region.
 Silent and deadly, Ned and Winceham searched for the sisters, like wild
 swirling dervished through a desert of stone.
 The keep was almost empty, it seemed suddenly.
 And the sisters were nowhere to be found, or seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until they heard a different voice, in a very different way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top of the tower, if you please.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you hear that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm trying to quit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham reflexively, in a purely defensive voice.
 He then realised Ned was hearing it too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Top of the tower?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Speaking in our minds? What devilry is this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned in disbelief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure, but it could be a trap,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham nodding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What choice is there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a shrug.
 Winceham added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

True, but I felt compelled to say that, just to make my point.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned placed a hand on Winceham's good shoulder and told him with ardor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hurry, Wince.
 Be on your toes, and try to hide yourself in the shadows up there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Believe me when I say that would have been my first choice as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them ran up the tower expecting some kind of surprise on the
 way, but nothing obstructed them.
 Soon, they emerged at the tower's top, the night sky glistening with starlight,
 the clouds below a soft, tempting milky white matress.
 They noticed alarmingly that the ship was missing, along with any signs
 of Theo and Bo.
 But what really caught their eye though, was the way the sisters stood,
 not far away from the tower's ledge right in front of the staircase: frozen
 like statues, the intensity of their plight drawn on their living, faces.
 They seemed to barely breath as Parcifal stood with Encelados blaring white
 hot above her head, both hands on the hilt, her face scrounged up in a
 mix of terror and hate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood beside her like the calm sea, deatermined and unyielding as
 she was about to let an arrow fly; yet the bow's string remained taut,
 and Lernea stood as if petrified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet they both seemed to breath.
 Right behind the sisters stood an extremely tall, lavishly robed man with
 a beard, ruffled hair and a sharp, too sharp too be real, icy blue gleam
 on his eyes.
 Winceham tried to meld into the shadow, taking small backsteps to the nearest
 ledge, his face hooded.
 He spoke then with a rolling, deep voice that sounded like stony reeds
 alongside a foaming river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Now, now, Mr.
 Abbermouth.
 That would be futile, as much as it may hurt your ego.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hobb,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 stated Ned coldly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, yes.
 Among others,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the man, the torch in his hand casting wild, creepy shadows of the
 two sisters as he silently and uncannily walked between them.
 Winceham noticed an unsettling thing about him; he wasn't actually walking.
 He was gliding a couple of inches above the stone floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are responsible for my father's death,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and glared at him, heedless of how peculiar the man's voice and
 looks were, apart from the fact he was levitating.
 Hobb came to a stop and smiled thinly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Weird things, humans.
 You blame me for your father's death, while Culliper pulled that trigger.
 And still, you couldn't kill him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you know that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned with uneasy suspicion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know many things.
 But what I crave right now is one: that amulet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's voice had a deadly finality to it: it took great composure for a
 man to simply talk, yet Ned found in him the audacity to talk back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not a jewelcrafter; you have the wrong person.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's face suddenly scrounged and stretched impossibly.
 With another twist of its flesh and a growling, the human face evaporated
 and instead an elongated head was now visible.
 Grey-blue skin shone slick in the starlight, and a flock of stubby, short
 tentacles like anemones writhed around a circular, sharp-teethed maw.
 Hobb, it turned out, was literally some kind of monster out of a nightmare.
 The creature that had disquised itself as Hobb looked at Ned with irritated
 curiosity and blared ominously, his voice now grating:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't play coy with me! I know about your little escapades, and these females
 pathetic dreams! I couldn't care less.
 Where is the amulet?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's a really ugly way to ask for things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, while he noticed Winceham stood silent and immobile as a rock.
 Ned realised he was suddenly a little more outmatched, but carried on,
 trying to understand the foe in front of him and think of what to do next,
 really, really fast.
 The creature approached him with unnerving silence and stood a few feet
 away.
 Its blue-on-blue eyes had the colour of the deepest sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The comedian.
 Humor.
 How infantile.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Better infantile than have a mop for a face,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned told him pointing to his maw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You mock me? I am beyond mocking.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes, I see mopping really is beneath you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned grinning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You puny little human, you cannot begin to fathom the aeons that have born
 me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, but I'm pretty sure you bore me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and noticed Winceham's eyes twitch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was hoping I did not have to feed tonight; your minds sicken me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I could say the same thing about your face but that would be a compliment
 in your case,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ned, and saw Lernea hand spasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll have what is mine, Ned Larkin, and you'll have what you deserve!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the monster as he lunged forward with a gaping maw, aiming squarely
 for Ned's head, his powerful long arms springing to catch Ned in a deathly
 embrace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was right at that time that Lernea's arrow struck him in the back,
 causing him to turn around reflexively and growl, his maw tentacles writhing
 like the feet of a millipede.
 Ned slid away and run towards the wheeled platform where they had docked
 at first.
 With a corner of his eye, he saw Lernea beginning to move, and Parcifal
 hands trembling; Winceham too, could move his head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will find great delight in sucking your skull dry, Larkin!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the creature as he hurled himself against Ned, his robes fluttering
 in the night breeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With your sense of humor, that's a no-brainer!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled Ned gleefully and saw Lernea, Parcifal and Winceham suddenly unfreeze,
 and without a second look at their surroundings, train their weapons against
 the creature with angered shouts and brave cries:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skarla, we'll have vengeance!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled the sisters, and Winceham simply added before rushing towards the
 blue-skinned terror:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ya think you're tall, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a wave of his hand and a low-key hum from it's maw, all three of them
 were pushed back in the air, landing hard on their backs, their weapons
 flying off their hands.
 The monster turned its attention squarely at Ned, before it added gleefully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is the humor now, human?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last word had the subtle hints of sounding exactly like vermin would.
 Ned smiled coolly and retorted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You just keep asking yourself, don't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The creature let out a terrible sound between an infuriated growl and a
 cacophonous gurgling laughter before it tried to reach for Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right when there was nothing funny to joke about, right when Ned could see
 the others were still trying to get up, too far away to act, he saw Bo,
 the bunny with the flaming eyes jump right in front of him, smile uncannily
 and hop back out of view in a split second, right before the hot molten
 cannonball hit the monster square across the face and embedded what was
 left of him and his smouldering robes in the tower's ledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then saw the ship wobbling uncertainly, and Theo hurrying to man the
 helm, the bow cannon cooling with a red-after glow on its lip and a thin
 whisp of smoke carried westward, where the wind blew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled broadly and sighed, while Winceham yelled as he looked around
 for confirmation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did ya see it? Did ya see the bunny?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters got up on their feet, nursing aching muscles and perhaps a couple
 of displaced bones.
 Lernea was about to say something to Winceham, but she changed her mind
 as she saw a bright flash and an uncanny oval slit appear in the night
 sky.
 It was looking peering through a looking glass, but all broken and uneven,
 like someone had pieced together parts of another night sky; another place
 lay beyond that oval.
 The monster limping heavily, glanced at Ned and said nothing.
 It's eyes flashed suddenly, before it crossed into the oval slit, which
 then instantly disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stood there unable to really understand what had happened.
 So did the others.
 Theo though, seemingly unfazed, settled the sloop near the platform a bit
 awkwardly, and jumped off the ship, quickly tying her down to the tower
 with a rope.
 He sounded awfully excited when he rushed over by Ned's side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wow! Did you see that? I think it left a crater!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Where were you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned weakly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, that pirate was making weird noises like the ones people do when they
 die, and Bo seemed really worried when the ship began to wobble really
 bad.
 He kind of insisted that I put my amulet in this weird slot in that awful
 chair, and then all the wobbling stopped.
 But the pirate died,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answered Theo truthfully, with a somewhat sad voice at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No I mean, where were you when all this happened?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, I heard this weird voice in my head, and it felt all wrong; I was already
 at the top of the tower.
 But for some reason, Bo was already gnawing on that rope we had tied, and
 before I could convince him otherwise, the ship had drifted away, and I
 thought I'd give her a spin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo excitedly and added thoughtfully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You did say I should keep an eye on her, didn't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes I did.
 I'm not sure though what would have happened if I hadn't.
 Or just what kind of a bunny Bo is, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, ponderously gazing at bo who was happily tucked away again inside
 Theo's robes, his face barely protruding, and his nose twitching as if
 he was about to sneeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well what about that? You might be actually funny, lad.
 I think it saved our lives, actually.
 I couldn't flutter an eyelid, but everything you said, cracked me up! And
 then I could move again!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham as he nourished a bruised elbow, grinning as he approached
 Ned and Theo.
 The sisters followed close behind, bickering about which one's fault some
 thing, or the other, was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He, it, whatever, caught you by surprise!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea told Parcifal accusingly, who replied in even yet more aggravated
 tones:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Me? You were the one who said to go have a look! Your decision, your responsibil

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 yelled Lernea, when Theo saw Culliper untying the rope that held the ship
 moored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's trying to get away!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Theo and began to twirl his hands in the air for no apparent reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You didn't tie him down?!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned in disbelief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You told me to look after the ship, not him!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Theo as the air between his hands filled with a warm, violet light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Amateurs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham softly and picking up a loose cobblestone, closed one eye
 and aimed at Culliper, just as he was about to start running back to the
 ship.
 Winceham threw the stone expertly, and it connected with Culliper's head
 at a very accident-prone spot; the back.
 He staggered for a couple of steps, before collapsing.
\end_layout
