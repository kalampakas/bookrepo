\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was standing at the docks, watching the good ship Autania as it
 gracefully waded through the peaceful water of Hobb's Bay; the wind was
 on her stern, her sails full.
 She was making good speed.

I hope the damn thing sinks and they all drown,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a scowl on her face.
 Behind her, the harbor was settling into its nightly rhythm.
 Rowdy sailors were looking for the next tavern in line to get drunk and
 have a brawl, the traders were finishing up their business with shady-looking
 characters and the fishermen were making ready for the break of dawn and
 the next catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was sitting right beside her on the stony pier, her naked feet dangling
 in the water.
 She asked Parcifal with had a sad look on her face:

No, we can't go back Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Parcifal with a sigh and a shake of her head, her piercing gaze
 stuck somewhere beyond the rosy-red horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with raised eyebrows.
 She noticed Parcifal's strange, angry look and knew it wasn't the right
 thing to do but asked her anyway:

Not ever?

Parcifal turned her head slowly around and gave Lernea a stabbing look before
 answering coldly:

Not as long as the Jangdrivals are in power and the Unseen Council remains
 in place, not while the Eleven Pillars stand and the Noble Eagles fly above
 the Skarlas, no.

 Lernea put a finger on her lip and with a puzzled frown asked again:

Is that never, or really just a long time?

Well, didn't master Sisyphus always say, `never say never'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with a hesitant smile creeping up on her lip.
 Parcifal's visage turned suddenly sorrowful, like a noble, sleek and gray
 statue.

Master Sisyphus is dead.

That doesn't mean he was wrong, though.
 Never is such a final word, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and stood up on her toes, her hands on her waist.
 She faced her sister with a bright smile full of optimism which her sister
 did not share.
 In fact, her sadness turned into abject anger at Lernea's persistence to
 face their new reality.

Get it right in that little thick skull of yours, Lernea.
 We, are, never, going, back, to, Nomos.
 Never!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, a lone finger rapping at Lernea's breastplate loudly after
 every word.
 Lernea's eyes wandered to her chest for a moment, before her face reddened
 and her breathing became more pronounced, her nostrils flaring up.
 She pouted her lips and said icily:

Lernea was cut in mid-sentence even as her mouth began to form the word
 'cow'.
 She had instinctively flung her arm and was grabbing at what seemed to
 be a child's arm, the arm extending into a hand holding her coinpurse.

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal took out a silver, teardrop-shaped knife and took a step towards
 her sister's side where the form of a short person stood frozen, said person
 pretending he was nothing more than a misplaced piece of sculpture.
