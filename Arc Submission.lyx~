No such thing as a free dinner

\begin_layout Author
Vasileios Kalampakas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke pulled down his visor.
 A freezing gust of wind buffeted against his face, forcing to momentarily
 look the other way.
 Bjorn laughed, hands crossed over his chest, a carefully constructed grin
 on his face.
 He slapped Sousuke's back and started walking towards the crawler, shaking
 his head half-way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone laughed at the new guy, that much was to be expected.
 Except Sousuke had been stationed in Field Zeta for three years, no rotation.
 Just two weeks of R&R each year: three hours by helicopter to Spitsbergen,
 then a four-hour flight to Murmansk to the Roskosmos SSTO.
 From there it was a three-hour suborbital flight to anywhere he might want
 to be.
 Which was the hard part, since anyplace looked and felt pretty much the
 same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he put on his best effort at a smile, Sousuke thought that was going
 to change sometime soon.
 Perhaps even overnight.
 It wasn't for him to fret about though; he would do his part and then it
 would either fail or succeed.
 There could be no middle ground, no chance at negotiating or talking things
 over.
 Not even if they wanted to.
 No failsafe, no human factor.
 Except himself, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn shouted at him from the relative comfort of the crawler:

\begin_layout Standard
For a reason that was wholly above and beyond Sousuke's understanding, Bjorn
 seemed to relish in the job of running around in a snow crawler, day or
 night, searching almost blindly for thorium deposits in the faceless white
 desert of the Arctic.
 Perhaps it was the rush of discovery, or the associated finder's fee.
 Perhaps it was just Bjorn being Norwegian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there was nothing to like in this kind of job, even if it had taken
 Sousuke a while to really find out why.
