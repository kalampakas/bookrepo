Necessity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Vasileios Kalampakas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke pulled down his visor.
 A freezing gust of wind buffeted against his face suddenly; it made him
 swivel around like someone had slapped him; he lost his balance and fell
 on his back.
 Fresh powdery snow went up in a small silver cloud around him.
 Fresh snow in Greenland.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn laughed with hands crossed over his chest and a carefully constructed
 grin on his face.
 He helped Sousuke back on his feet and started walking towards the crawler,
 shaking his head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half-way there he paused to pick up the surveyor unit; he brushed some snow
 off his beard, powered down the panel, folded the telescopic legs and placed
 the very expensive piece of eqipment across his shoulders.
 Bjorn worked as a lumberjack before he signed up for this one, back when
 Hemmeldalen was still green.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He ventured a glimpse at Sousuke; he was struggling to walk upwind; Bjorn
 shook his head once more, and chuckled.
 He couldn't for the life of him, understand what made a guy like Sousuke
 take this job.
 He knew his geology stuff, but other than that..
 Everyday seemed like his first day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone laughed at the new guy, that much was to be expected.
 The psychologists on the evaluation team always noted it was a sign of
 good mental health.
 A few practical jokes and a some seriously bad efforts at humor were the
 order of the day at seventy-four degrees latitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except Sousuke had been stationed in Field Zeta for three years, without
 rotation.
 It hadn't grown on him; it had made him sick.
 But somehow he never asked to transfer out; he didn't complain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three weeks of leave each year, and that was it.
 That was his lifeline with the world that despite the climate change and
 the Disconnect of '33 and the Big Melt of '35, still had beautiful warm
 beaches filled with young girls in miniscule bikinis.
 Even in Hokkaido in November.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three hours by helicopter to Spitsbergen, then a four-hour flight to Murmansk
 to the Roskosmos SSTO.
 From there on, it was a three-hour suborbital flight to almost any place
 on Earth.
 And still, when it came time to buy that ticket, he always flew to Sapporo.
 He somehow always wanted to see the half-sunken family house at Nemuro,
 the cherry treetops grazing the sea surface like dead corals.
 He tried to remember what the blossoms looked like; a faint memory of a
 fragrant smell came up instead.
 And bees.
 He remembered their sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He must've been woolgathering there for a moment; Bjorn was shouting at
 him to move on.
 He put on his best effort at a smile and gave a thumbs up to Bjorn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wished there was some other way to go about it, but he had committed
 himself.
 Everything was going to change, soon enough.
 For the better.
 He shouldn't worry too much though; he would do his part and then they
 would either fail or succeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There could be no middle ground, no chance at negotiating or talking things
 over once it went down.
 Not even if they wanted to.
 No failsafe, no human factor.
 Except himself, of course.
 And Joussef, Jun, and Richard.
 They'd all do their part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn shouted at him again from the relative comfort of the crawler, a lit
 smoke already in hand:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a reason that was wholly above and beyond Sousuke's understanding, Bjorn
 seemed to relish in the job of running around in a snow crawler in the
 undecided day or night of the Arctic, searching almost blindly for thorium
 deposits in a faceless white desert.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it was the rush of discovery, or the associated finder's fee.
 Perhaps it was just Bjorn being Norwegian.
 Robots might have been able to do the job better, cheaper, and a whole
 lot warmer for any humans involved in the process.
 But they couldn't be trusted; not like regular folk itching for a chance
 to live the life.
 Anything that could transmit and receive couldn't be trusted these days.
 The Disconnect had made sure of that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke jumped inside the crawler, closed the door behind him, reached for
 his thermo and poured a cup of almost scalding hot tea.
 He didn't sip, he just held on to it for warmth.
 Bjorn started the engine and focused his attention on the control panel,
 waiting for the 'Engine Ready' sign to light up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He drew a puff from his cigarette and offered Sousuke one, purely from habit.
 Sousuke shook his head, still wearing the heavy fur-lined hood: real fur,
 an overpriced luxury, never mind banned by the UN, or what it had lately
 voted to call itself the Earth Coalition.
 As if the name `United Nations' somehow offended the Big Three.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke relaxed a bit into his seat, stretching his legs.
 The cabin of the crawler was spacious, but spartan.
 He'd turned an empty display socket into a small sort of basket.
 There was a small nook somewhere in the plastic that doubled as a cup holder.
 Sousuke placed the cup there and closed his eyes for a moment.
 The engine revved up suddenly, making the crawler lurch forward like a
 startled beast.
 The tea spilled; Sousuke looked at Bjorn who simply shrugged and drove
 on through the snow.
\end_layout

There's more where that came from, no?

 Bjorn retorted in an equally dry manner,

Still,

 came the bleak answer.

\begin_layout Standard
Stan passed on the borsht and instead made his way to the pantry.
 His wrinkled nose gave away the fact that the smell put him off.
 Sergei shrugged and dug in heartily, though rather noisily.
 Miki and Elaine were sitting at one table, playing a rather convoluted
 version of chess, involving dice and an imaginary toroidal chessboard.
 It hadn't caught on with the rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were heavily absorbed, and didn't take notice of Stan nibbling away
 at their snacks.
 Souvenirs' from a trip southside: goat's cheese and garlic bread from France;
 smoked salmon from Finland.
 They didn't even take notice when Stan sat down next to them, pretending
 to watch while stuffing himself shamelessly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn entered the small but comfy mess room, all red-faced and smiling.
 Sousuke followed close behind, his thermo in hand and a more than usually
 sore look on his face.
 Stan had the courtesy to swallow before asking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's with Takahashi?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn gave a shrug and made his way to the toilet, while Sousuke simply
 ignored Stan and vanished inside the small kitchen.
 Stan downed another bite of cheese before talking to practically none other
 than himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's with everyone? Not enough snow? Too much white in your day? What
 is it this time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sergei looked up from his meal, opted to pitch in by shrugging and happily
 continued sipping his soup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I spilled his tea!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came Bjorn's muffled shout from the toilet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All of it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, asked Stan leaning back on his chair.
 Elaine momentarily raised her head searching for the source of the small
 raucus, but gave no sign it was about to ruin her game.
 Miki took Elaine's knight, smiled and announced her victory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Checkmate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaine took a moment to look at the chessboard like it had grown legs.
 Befuddled, she asked rather haplessly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No? No way out? If I..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Checkmate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Miki, barely shaking her head.
 She then turned to Stan with a frown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you eat all the cheese?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan licked his lips and looked at the ceiling mischievously.
 Elaine buried her face in her palms, her voice barely audible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Merdre..
 Three times in a row.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn came out of the toilet with his work suit unzipped, hanging around
 his waist like a peeled banana.
 A lot of sarcasm but just a hint of genuine concern went into his question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't it strange that a quarter of the world's thorium stock relies on a
 bunch of geeks with a lot of time, a lot of money, and very little in the
 way of spending either?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke came out of the kitchen holding a sword.
 An unsheathed sword.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan was the first one to exclaim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wow! A real-life samurai.
 Just like in those old movies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They all smiled.
 Bjorn laughed.
 Sousuke did not seem to share their humourous disposition.
 He was looking intently at the shining metal of the blade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't that the antique you brought in last time? What was the name for -
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn's sentence was cut in half, as was his throat.
 Jets of blood sprayed Sousuke as he moved with sharp, calculated steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sergei was trying to smash through an observation pane when Sousuke's blade
 severed his spine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan tried to put up a fight with a shovel that happened to be lying around
 but his one swing never connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke was flawless, each move of the blade a killing blow; Stan's head
 rolled off his spine like it had been fake all along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaine rushed to the door only to find it locked from the inside - everyone
 had been too absorbed to notice.
 Her death wound was clean, through the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Miki sat frozen still at the table, clutching at the chessboard.
 It happened; some animals never flee - they accept the inevitable nature
 of death, seeing through the falseness of their instincts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her evolved brain though had to know, so she asked, tears running down her
 face.
 Amidst sobs and silent, muffled cries she managed to croak:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why? Whatever the reason, why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I hate you, Miki.
 I hate the whole world.

\begin_layout Standard
It was just him now.
 The katana had served its purpose.
 He didn't know why exactly, but he felt compelled to bury the Fukushima
 Masamune in the snow, next to their bodies, leaving the hilt exposed.
 It would have to do instead of a cross.
 He looked at his watch; there was still ample time to start his descent
 to the Pit until what passed for evening at this latitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat down on a work uniform next to the sword, and crossed his legs; he
 breathed deeply, letting the cold inrush of air revitalize his senses.
 The sun's blurry orange shape somehow felt as cold as the snow.
 There was no warmth in that sight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a moment to reflect; he did that often but he always felt constricted,
 as if imprisoned.
 Somehow with all the people around him killed though he felt serene, liberated.
 He smiled despite himself at the thought that he had almost forgotten the
 feeling of serenity; they irony that he had to kill five people to feel
 at peace was not entirely lost to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He remembered Miki's question then, and he somehow felt his answer had been
 - on retrospect - incomplete.
 The least he could've done was take a deep breath right then and there
 and tell her why he hated the world.
 Explain, make her understand.
 Maybe she could realise it wasn't personal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew he didn't need some sort of validation or acceptance of what he
 had done, or what he was about to do.
 He had made up his mind, he just couldn't tell when exactly.
 Maybe even before he had been selected for this task.
 Perhaps it was when he saw his grandfather's orchard being slowly eaten
 away by the rising sea in just a few months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it had been the Disconnect that had cleared up his mind.
 He felt it had freed him from all the digital detritus of a quietly but
 falsely discontent life, from all the by-products of a society hell-bent
 on pacing itself out of existence.
 It made him think.
 That was when he went to the temple at Sengakuji, hunting for his inner
 demon, his own personal

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his search, he found out what humanity lacked: a sense of balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nations had failed, time and again; the monstrously deceiving financial
 system couldn't sustain the boom-and-doom cycle.
 As a means of hoarding wealth, energy became scarce even in the developed
 world.
 Feeding on the human propensity to dream, imagine and create the global
 information network was slowly turned into a parasite that took root into
 people's hearts and minds twisting them, enslaving them, watching them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Disconnect changed all that.
 The network did not devolve or wither away; it went away with a bang.
 Nobody is perfectly sure why it happened.
 Horrible error or extreme terrorism, it nearly plunged the globe into unremitti
ng chaos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every connected machine had become infested.
 Efforts to reinstate a new network failed.
 No virus could be detected.
 Even radiation-hardened systems failed consistently.
 The networking infrastructure collapsed.
 The era of the internet had died.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along with it came most communications, industry and finance.
 Anything more advanced than a radio or a pulse tone telephone was practically
 impossible to operate in a meaningful way.
 Someone had let the world slip into its Gernsback pajamas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People woke up having to learn how to live anew.
 Sousuke remembered how distraught his father had looked to him those first
 few days, while his grandfather smiled wryly, watering his watermelons
 and reminiscing about his own childhood.
 `The only net we knew was the fishing kind', he had said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't the complete catastrophe the media had predicted; these were hard
 times, but famine and disease did not spread like wildfire - however dependent
 the world had become around its gadgets and smart networked machines, a
 man still had his own hands to rely upon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the things without faces or hands that had it worst: corporations.
 About to hang themselves with a rope they had pretty much made themselves,
 they tried to think big for a change.
 But only after the Big Melt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only measurable cause was a freak increase in solar radiation.
 But that couldn't account for almost half the Greenland ice sheet melting
 away in just two years.
 Extreme measures were put in place; weather systems went to hell.
 The global conglomerates offered to practically buy most nations around
 the Earth and in exchange provide the means to survive.
 Few could refuse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corporations invested every last iota of what remained of their resources,
 human and otherwise, into what became known as the `shift'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thorium-based nuclear power became a main source of electrical power production,
 alongside the solar forests of the Sahara and the Great Energy Reef in
 the Pacific, right on top of the dying Great Barrier Reef.
 The Chinese having founded their Second Empire relied on fusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Space became a real priority for the first time: the mass driver on the
 moon supplied Earth with cheap processed strategic minerals, while tugboats
 hauled asteroids for exploitation near mineral refineries at the Langrangian
 points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Alps had melted away, but the Himalayas made for excellent skiing.
 The tropics were delineated anew.
 Winter - for the most part - became a historic reference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In just two decades everything had seemed to change, while it had actually
 remained the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not to Sousuke.
 Not to the others like him.
 Joussef at Bilma, Richard at Lizard Island, Jun at Lake Nasihu.
 At 20:00 UTA, the world would plunge into darkness, and humanity would
 either truly to evolve or die out.
 Just like so many species before man.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got up and walked to the service elevator.
 He depressed the descent button, and watched the various strata of rock
 roll past him evenly, as if he was walking down the two mile shaft at an
 easy pace.
 The main generation facility was a huge natural underground cavern, carefully
 modified to accomodate the single largest power generation station in the
 world, an array of thousands of thorium reactors capable of producing energy
 in the scale of terawatts.
 Room-temperature superconductors carried it through the rock and across
 the ocean bed to America and Europe alike.
 Africa had become completely self-sufficient due to the Sahara Solar Field,
 and Asia was being fed by the Chinese Empire's fusion stations.
 Australia and Japan relied on the Great Barrier Reef.
 Four central locations provided the world with more than enough energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it wasn't free.
 Nothing, ever, was free.
 Except for their own conscience, their own spirit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did not expect to be lauded; far from it, there were no misconceptions
 on how the childish masses of the human populace would greet their vision-come-
reality.
 There would be little in the way of assigning guilt and blame when the
 whole planet would be just another black spot in the night sky.
 When each man's reach would be as wide as any kingdom's, past or newborn
 alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words of Rudi came to mind then, in that bar in Magdeburg: `The world
 needs a reset button, and we will push it.' For the first time in a long
 while he smiled for noone to see.

The wall of the corridor was ridden with indication LEDs, a living tapestry
 of light.
 The air was stale; it had a heavy copper scent about it.
 The warmth from the heat exchangers was a stark contrast to the temperature
 at the surface.
 A gentle breeze flowed through the maze of valve computers.
 There was no victorianesque quality to them, he noticed; simply a crude
 lack of imagination, a persistent lack of taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He walked through the maze of interconnects and cabling grids.
 At times, he ventured a look upwards into the bleak emptiness of the cavern.
 There was the faintest light coming down from the ventilation shafts, a
 gray-blue light, its hue reminiscent of dark ice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a while, he reached the central distribution hub.
 From there, he would interfere with the neutron emission mechanism, and
 turn the whole grid into a giant ticking bomb.
 Joussef would reorient all the reflectors in such a way as to cause them
 to melt down, while Jun would simply release the dam's valves over at Lake
 Nasihu and cause all the water to flood onto the valley.
 Thinking about how people had turned to people once again because they
 could be trusted smelled like poetic justice to Sousuke.
 He laid down his backpack near an access panel, when he heard footsteps
 and a metallic, clicking sound that faintly echoed barely above the low-pitched
 hum of the machinery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

End of the line, Sousuke.
 Hands off the backpack.
 Just kick it towards me,

 Another pair of footsteps could be heard approaching pacefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Sousuke with genuine curiousity.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wouldn't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said a female voice that somehow seemed too familiar to Sousuke.
 She spoke with a heavy japanese accent.
 The realisation hit Sousuke too hard, too late.
\end_layout

Kaname?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked plainly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I needn't to, but I wanted to see you one last time.
 You realise, three similar yet less civilized conversations are taking
 place elsewhere.
 You probably want to know why, and I do want to tell you why.
 Because I hate you, and your kind Sousuke.
 You're kids playing with adults.
 It's not about money and greed, or power, whatever your idea of the worlds
 powers might be.
 It's about survival.
 You'd wreck humanity in your neo-lutheran dream of simpler, darker days.
 You think we're alone out there.
 Would you do otherwise had you known we're not?

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded accusing, but there was conviction behind those words.
 They rang true to Sousuke's ears.
 He brought a picture of Kaname playing hide-and-seek in the cherry orchard.
 She always managed to surprise him.
 His voice carried all his sense of pity and grief into a simple word:

No.

 Kaname asked with a dry throat.
 Sousuke hesitated for a moment, then replied:

Yes, we did..
 Kaname, was all that necessary then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the gun could be heard walking a few more paces towards Sousuke.
 Kaname tried to sound composed, but her voice wavered slightly:

Would it matter, whatever my answer?

 neck.
