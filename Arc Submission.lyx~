\begin_layout Title
No such thing as a free dinner
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Vasileios Kalampakas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke pulled down his visor.
 A freezing gust of wind buffeted against his face suddenly; it made him
 swivel around like someone had slapped him, lose his balance and fall on
 his back, fresh powdery snow going up in a small silver cloud around him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn laughed with hands crossed over his chest and a carefully constructed
 grin on his face.
 Once Sousuke was back on his feet, he slapped him across the back and started
 walking towards the crawler, shaking his head.
 Half-way there he paused to pick up the surveyor unit; he brushed some
 snow off his beard, powered down the panel, folded the telescopic legs
 and placed the very expensive piece of eqipment across his shoulders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A glimpse at Sousuke almost struggling to walk upwind; another shake of
 the head, and a laughter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone laughed at the new guy, that much was to be expected.
 It was actually a sign of good mental health.
 Practical jokes and a tendency to make fun of every little thing were commonpla
ce, working this far north of civilization.
 Except Sousuke had been stationed in Field Zeta for three years, no rotation.
 It hadn't grown on him; it made him sick.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three weeks of leave each year, that was it.
 That was his lifeline with the world that despite the climate change and
 the Big Melt of '33 and the Disconnect of '35, still had beautiful warm
 beaches filled with young girls in miniscule bikinis.
 Even in Hokkaido in November.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three hours by helicopter to Spitsbergen, then a four-hour flight to Murmansk
 to the Roskosmos SSTO.
 From there on, it was a three-hour suborbital flight to almost any place
 on Earth.
 And still, when it came time to buy that ticket, he always flew to Sapporo.
 He somehow always wanted to see the half-sunken family house at Nemuro,
 the cherry tree orchards sitting right beneath the surface like dead corals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He put on his best effort at a smile and gave a thumbs up to Bjorn.
 He suddenly wished there was some other way to go about it, but he had
 committed himself.
 Everything was going to change, soon enough.
 Perhaps even overnight and hopefully for the better.
 It wasn't for him to fret about though; he would do his part and then they
 would either fail or succeed.
 There could be no middle ground, no chance at negotiating or talking things
 over once it went down.
 Not even if they wanted to.
 No failsafe, no human factor.
 Except himself, of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn shouted at him from the relative comfort of the crawler, a lit smoke
 already in hand:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a reason that was wholly above and beyond Sousuke's understanding, Bjorn
 seemed to relish in the job of running around in a snow crawler in the
 undecided day or night of the Arctic, searching almost blindly for thorium
 deposits in the faceless white desert of the Arctic.
 Perhaps it was the rush of discovery, or the associated finder's fee.
 Perhaps it was just Bjorn being Norwegian.
 Robots might have been able to do the job better, cheaper, and a whole
 lot warmer for any humans involved in the process.
 But they couldn't be trusted, not like regular folk itching for a chance
 to live the life.
 Anything that could transmit and receive couldn't be trusted these days.
 The Disconnect had made sure of that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke jumped inside the crawler, closed the door behind him, reached for
 his thermo and poured a cup of almost scalding hot tea.
 He didn't sip, he just held on to it for the warmth.
 Bjorn started the engine and focused his attention on the control panel,
 waiting for the 'Engine Ready' sign to light up.
 He drew a puff from his cigarette and offered Sousuke one, purely from
 habit.
 Sousuke shook his head, still wearing the heavy fur-lined hood: real fur,
 an overpriced luxury, never mind banned by the UN, or what it lately voted
 to call itself the Earth Coalition.
 As if the name `United Nations' somehow offended the Big Three.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He relaxed a bit into the seat, stretching his legs.
 The cabin of the crawler was spacious, but spartan.
 He'd turned an empty display socket into a small sort of basket.
 There was a small nook somewhere in the plastic that doubled as a cup holder.
 Sousuke placed the cup there and closed his eyes for a moment.
 The engine revved up suddenly, making the crawler lurch forward like a
 startled beast.
 The tea spilled; Sousuke looked at Bjorn who simply shrugged and drove
 on through the snow.

You could have asked,

 Bjorn retorted in an equally dry manner,

Still,

 came the bleak answer.

\begin_layout Standard
Stan passed on the borsht and instead made his way to the pantry.
 His wrinkled nose gave away the fact that the smell put him off.
 Sergei shrugged and dug in heartily, though rather noisily.
 Miki and Elaine were sitting at one table, playing a rather convoluted
 version of chess, involving dice and an imaginary toroidal chessboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were heavily absorbed, and didn't take notice of Stan eating away at
 the snacks they'd brought with them from their last trip south: goat's
 cheese and garlic bread from France, and smoked salmon from Finland.
 They didn't even notice when Stan sat down next to them, pretending to
 watch while stuffing himself shamelessly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn entered the small but comfy mess room, all red-faced and smiling.
 Sousuke followed close behind, his thermo in hand and a sore look on his
 face.
 Stan took notice and asked after swallowing a mouthful:

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn gave a shrug and made his way to the toilet, while Sousuke ignored
 Stan and vanished in the small kitchen.
 Stan downed another bite of cheese before talking to practically none other
 than himself:

What's with everyone? Not enough snow? Too much white in your day? What

Sergei looked up from his meal, shrugged and happily continued sipping his
 soup being a little more mindful of those around him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I spilled his tea!

 came Bjorn's muffled shout.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All of it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, asked Stan leaning back on his chair.
 Elaine momentarily raised her head searching for the source of the small
 raucus, but gave no sign it was about to ruin her game.
 Miki took Elaine's knight, smiled and announced her victory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Checkmate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaine cursed and looked at the chessboard befuddled, before asking rather
 haplessly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No? No way out? If I..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Checkmate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 repeated Miki, barely shaking her head and asked:

Did you eat all the cheese?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a confused look written across her features, pointing at Stan
 with an accusing finger.
 Stan licked his lips and looked at the ceiling mischievously.
 Elaine buried her face in her palms, her voice quite heartless:

Merdre..
 Three times in a row.

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn came out of the toilet, his work suit unzipped, hanging around his
 waist like a peeled banana.
 He said then with a lot of sarcasm but just a touch of genuine concern:
\end_layout

Isn't it strange that a quarter of the world's thorium stock relies on a
 bunch of geeks with a lot of time, a lot of money, and little in the way
 of spending either?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke came out of the kitchen holding a sword.
 An unsheathed sword.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan was the first one to exclaim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wow! A real-life samurai.
 Just like in those old movies.

Bjorn looked a little curious when he asked:

Isn't that the antique you brought in last time? What was the name for -

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His sentence was cut in half, as was his throat.
 Jets of blood sprayed Sousuke as he mercilessly and efficiently cut down
 each and every one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sergei was still trying to smash through a window when Sousuke's blade severed
 his spine.
 Stan tried to put up a fight with a shovel that happened to be lying around
 but his one swing never connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke on the other hand, was flawless - like a machine; Stan's head rolled
 off his spine like it had been fake all along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaine found out that the door had been locked from the inside - everyone
 had been too absorbed to notice.
 Her wound was clean, through the heart; a small mercy of sorts.
 Miki sat frozen still at the table, clutching at the chessboard.
 It happened; even some animals never fled - accepting the inevitable, seeing
 through the falseness of their instincts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her developed brain though had to know, so she asked, with tears running
 down her face, amidst sobs and silent, muffled cries:
\end_layout

Why? Whatever the reason, why?

Because I hate you, Miki.
 I hate the whole world.
