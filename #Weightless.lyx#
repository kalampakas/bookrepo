\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
My name is Serandito Carival.
 I'm only writing it down because people often hear a story, whether it
 was real or not and wonder, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who did that
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Some might suspect I'm using an alias, others will point out that a name
 doesn't really matter.
 They would all be wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I am Serandito Carival and I'm proud of the things I've done, thankful of
 the memories I've kept and always fearful of the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
That is why I'm writing this, all of this.
 Because you must learn the truth of it all and pass it on to those that
 come after you, generation after generation, like a fable, like a myth.
 But never forget it was all true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because lies are what brought us on the path to extinction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I'm fearful it could all happen again.
 From the records and annals that have been restored in my time, it almost
 certainly happens again.
 That fear of mine, should become your fear as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because fear, as I will explain, can be a very useful tool.
 And you must know how to wield it, as well as live with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
There will be a time, in the future, when these writings - in whatever form
 - will be no more.
 It has been known, since almost ancient times, that the stars will wither
 and vanish, others more prominently than some.
 But still, the universe will die and along with it, every kind of life
 that populates it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
But mankind has to persevere in spite of that.
 Promise me this, as I in turn shall promise you:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
At the last light of the last star, there will be a man there to see it
 through to nothingness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Why, you might ask?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Picture it, I urge you.
 Hold that picture in your mind, make it a part of who you are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because that picture is all that stands between life and a fate far worse
 than death: Oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Maybe you're confused by now; perhaps I'm coming off as a cryptic stranger
 or as I've been called many times, a madman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I am simply a zealot.
 My aim is to turn you, whoever you are, into a zealot as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Since you're reading this, I'm either part of history, or something terrible
 has happened again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Read and learn my friend.
 And remember that Serandito Carival is just a name.
 But me, and you, we're more than that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
We're humans.
 Never forget that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
-- Serandito Carival, 
\shape italic
The death of our race

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is this all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun under a wheezy breath, his forehead glistening with sweat.
 Serandito nodded with a grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thirteen stacks in all.
 If we must meet the quota, we need another twelve by sunrise.
 Think you're up to it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun was trying hard not to show he was spent for the day; he put on a
 big hearty smile and after a couple of deep breaths turned around and headed
 back to the windcomb.
 He shouted at Serandito playfully, mischief drawn on his thick eyebrows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll be the death of me, Sera.
 Once we're done, you're treating me to some of your jeral, you hear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito shook his head and let out a knowing laugh.
 He put his hands on his waist and took a moment to marvel at the land around
 them; harvest time.
 A golden sea swayed nimbly in front of him, lit up with the purple hues
 of the setting sun.
 He could almost see the first stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you coming or will you just stand there? Ain't nothing you haven't seen,
 Sera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito smiled broadly before starting off towards the hovering harvester
 with a quick, almost joyful pace.
 He jumped inside the windcomb's gondola, causing it to bob and jerk slightly
 before he answered with a weird smirk on his face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would it be a real shame if I missed something new, Copun?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun reached out of the gondola, threw a bag of glowbees in the air and
 drew the anchor slowly.
 Hunched over one side of the gondola, he said without turning:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There hasn't been anything new around here since man set foot on this place,
 Sera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He heaved the last of the anchor on the deck with some strain and said without
 a hint of irony:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's the beauty of it; nothing really changes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The glowbees were up and about, flying around the windcomb, following a
 familiar pattern of their own.
 Their luminescent bellies lit up the gondola with a soft, warm orange light
 as they swarmed around it like slow-twirling flakes of bright snow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito looked around him one last time as if failing to find something
 that caught his imagination, nodded to Copun and jibbed the sail with one
 expert, crisp motion.
 The windcomb tacked gracefully against the first duskward gusts for the
 night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thirty-four C?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked while keeping an eye out for a good, strong buffet of wind out
 on the never-ending plain that stretched before them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, thirty-four C,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun without so much as a thought and sat down near the controller's
 seat, his back against a thin, metal rail.
 He sighed and slid a small toolbox nearby in front of his feet.
 He opened it and fussed around inside with both hands for a moment.
 At length, Copun's eyes lit up with a radiant gaze at the sight of a small,
 tin-like, container.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll just have a whiff.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito's disapproving stare fell on Copun.
 He said nothing at first, while the older man tapped on a pipe and filled
 it with finely-cut brown-black leaves, a genuine smile on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank the Protectors for the small luxuries of life, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun, lighting up his pipe with a sprinkle of 'golic and puffing
 at it wildly until a sweet, heavy aroma wafted around the gondola.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito took the seat next to the controller's, and touched some of the
 controls on the grimy, dusty panel.
 He shook his head slightly but said nothing.
 Copun took another draught from his pipe and said with a slight drawl:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It won't kill me now, boy.
 It's only quazza, to ease the mind, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito looked at him with a sour expression.
 It was one of the old man's worst habits and he simply would not let it
 go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know what it is, Copun.
 Your mind is filled with uneasiness? Again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito and scoffed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The toils of life, Serandito my boy.
 When you are my age, they start to pile up impossibly high,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Copun with an almost deliberately drunken smile.
 The quazza had started to set in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That thing clouds the mind, Copun.
 It makes everything hazy, muddied.
 Just like when in a fog.
 Shouldn't you at least wait until after we're done with our quota?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun made it a point to look behind his shoulder, to let his gaze wonder
 around the windcomb for a while.
 He smiled wryly and threw his head back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see no fog creeping up on us.
 You just do the sailing, and let me worry about my own troubles.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't like it one bit, Copun.
 That's proper poison inside your soul, right there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito, worried anger in his words.
 Copun couldn't help but laugh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The soul? Have you been prying around Old Man Legget's? That devil could
 get you in trouble and you wouldn't even know it till you're strapped down
 on that slave chair.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun's smile wavered for a bit, before he took a long, hard stare at Serandito.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a good man to talk to, Copun.
 You should have a couple of cups of jeral with him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ain't that a poison too now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Copun, the wrinkles on his forehead adding a sense of wonder to
 his smiling, curly lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito nodded fervently, realising he had been at fault to judge.
 He said with a shake of his head, his eyes watching the main sail ripple
 with the rising wind.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It opens up the spirits to roam about freely.
 Weren't you the one that asked for a treat as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun exhaled, thin snake-like trails of smoke carried away from his nostrils
 as the windcomb picked up more speed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, one can't expect to go away from this world as pure as one came, Sera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I guess not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Serandito and settled into a well-trained series of motions, adjusting
 the trim of the sail and making sure they were speeding along nicely in
 the right direction.
 Copun fell into silence, hands crossed behind his back, the quazza on his
 pipe almost gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito cherished these moments of silence, the sound of the rippling
 sails and the buffeting wind in harmony with the soft light of the bees,
 while all around them the murky shadows of faint starlight held fast, an
 unyielding river of darkness flowing between them and the grain stalks
 only a few feet below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sometimes I feel like I'm tresspassing someplace sacred,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Copun drowsily, as if being half-awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I said, sometimes I feel like I'm tresspassing.
 Like we shouldn't be here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nonsense.
 This is our lot here, boy.
 Thirty-four-C through thirty-eight-D of the Great Landing Plains.
 The Flats, boy, all ripe for harvest!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Copun suddenly in the night, and burst into laughter while the windcomb
 sped away, the swarm of glowbees around her bow and stern leaving a trail
 of wondrous, almost magical, soft light in her wake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sky above became suddenly darker, starlight begging its way through
 a veil of gathering, dark and heavy clouds.
 An indication flashed on the control panel in front of Serandito, along
 with an audible warning message.
 Serandito didn't need any of those signs to know what was happening; he
 felt the change of the wind in the handling of the boat, the way it became
 stubborn, its silky flow above the plains giving way to an erratic, capricious
 balance; it started to misbehave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Weather's going to turn, boy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun with an upset brow.
 Though intoxicated, he still had his senses about him.
 Serandito didn't grace him with a reply, busy as he was plotting a new
 course, checking the weather feed on the panel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun put out his pipe and looked at the sky warily; a broiling cluster
 of menace seemed to be heading their way.
 All across the plains, as far as they could see, a storm was approaching
 fast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is a big one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun, his eyes twitching at the sight of the immense storm front
 approaching.
 It stretched all the way from the Low Hill on their left, to the Crescent
 on their right; it was as if the horizon had turned into a foaming grey
 and blue, twirling madness and lunged at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A remarkable finding, Copun,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito mockingly before he urgently asked: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ride it or outrun it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're the sailor, Sera.
 I just harvest wheat.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito took a moment to check on the panel, then he gazed at the storm
 like as if looking at an old familiar face.
 A smirk crept over his lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll ride it through to its clear side then; it's coming in too fast, it'll
 catch on to us either way.
 This way, it'll be over quickly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, his voice picking up volume as the winds attacked the main sail,
 rippling it violently, the windcomb bucking and swaying noisily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hope it's not really over, Sera,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun with a twitch of fear in his words.
 Serandito turned to face him, his hands still at the controls.
 He had a wild, steely, blue-eyed gaze that seemed to bolt Copun into place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scared, old man?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked the old man, his face motionless, his eyes wandering around the
 wrinkles on Copun's leathery face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've seen worse, Sera.
 Your father always came through; you'll come through just as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Copun shouting, nodding with each and every word, reassuring himself
 mostly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Better, Copun.
 Better than my father,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito barely loud enough to be heard.
 He turned his attention to the storm in front of them and took a glimpse
 at his panel.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hang tight, the other end is almost a quadrant away.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A whole quadrant? Boy, that'll take us over all the way to the Tower,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted back Copun with wary disbelief.
 Serandito nodded promptly, his hair already a mess.
 In the distance, the first shots of lightning streaked across the horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Almost,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he raced to the jib.
 Working deftly with his hands, he lowered the sail and raised the collector
 boom, a metal rod of sorts, easily three times the height of the main mast.
 The first thick droplets of rain shot at the deck from an angle, the nema
 wood soaking the water like a sponge, keeping the deck safe to tread on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Damn the quota, we should've given up for the night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun as he reached below the panel and activated a set of controls.
 A harsh blue glow began to emanuate from below the deck, along with a sizzling
 sound of static.
 The smell of ozon mingled with the wet, earthly scent of the ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll have no regrets when this is past us, Copun, I assure you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Serandito with a shiny grin attached to his face.
 Copun opened a compartment on the deck and picked up a pair of harnesses.
 He wore one with one hand, the other one clutching at a handrail, the windcomb
 riding uneasily on blasts of sleet.
 Serandito reached for the other harness and put it on quickly it with practiced
 ease.
 He checked the safeties on the synthetic straps that held their harnesses
 locked to a metal deck ring and the handrail running around the small gondola.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your father wasn't this brash, you know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun, double-checking that his harness fit snugly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well I'm not him, am I?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Serandito in order to be heard over the rising raucous din of the
 storm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sail true, Sera, you still have to treat me to some jeral!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Copun earnestly, his long hair stuck wildly across his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito laughed his heart out as a strong curtain of rain and sleet caught
 on to them, harsh as a whiplash.
 The storm proper hit them with the rage of a spinning giant; the windcomb
 buckled and heaved steeply to one side, riding aloft a monster of a wind.
 The ion thruster in the gondola's belly kept the windcomb afloat, its nozzles
 flaring intensely white hot, shedding the darkness across a small spot
 on the plains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun and Serandito braced wave after wave of violent gusts and razing sleets,
 the windcomb below their feet carried along in a maddening dance, but always
 moving in the same direction, in a disturbingly persistent way.
 As its aft thrusters shot it upwards on layers of turbulent winds, it came
 down with stunning force as if ready to bore a hole into the ground, yet
 it bounced off in the last moment and kept at this way for minutes that
 seemed to stretch into hours for Serandito, but mostly so for Copun: his
 visage had turned almost ashen, his eyes closed as if in meditation, wrinkles
 crisscrossing every feature of his face.
 His calmness ended abruptly when a large red indicator lit up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ten percent capacity left, Sera! Where's the bloody edge of it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Not in sight, Copun.
 Have heart, it'll hit!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

Have you ever really done this before, boy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It'll hit, Copun.
 See that cluster over there? It's full of it! Look at the crackles inside!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll blast you to a cold dead void if you kill us tonight, Sera!

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can thank me in the morning!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito fiddled with the controls and set the helm and the thruster as
 he still had control of the windcomb.
 In truth, it barely changed course as the incredible winds tossed her this
 way and that.
 But the small harvest groundsail did not tumble over, and it did not yield
 to the demands of the ravaging storm its masters had so precariously chosen
 to ride.
 It zigzaged between ripples of wind and layers of thermal updrafts, rising
 uncontrollably high and swooping down with metal-straining speed, careening
 at angles that would have thrown Serandito and Copun off the gondola had
 it not been for their harnesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when it finally met with the energy-filled cluster of clouds Serandito
 had spotted, it seemed for a moment that the storm had quietened down,
 that they were floating more freely, the winds settling down to a strong
 but safe speed, as if the storm had spent its force.
 Copun looked up, inside the blistering, flashing core of luminance in the
 sky, where two colossal masses of clouds met, lightning streaking across
 them like a thunderous, blinding web of light.
 He stood with both hands on the rail, the winds fluttering his hair almost
 playfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it over?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're in the eye.
 I'd let go of that rail if I were you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito and shot Copun a stern, hard look.
 As Copun turned his head to look at Serandito with a puzzled look, everything
 around them filled with a sudden, violent surge of light.
 Serandito had been almost blinded but he thought he had seen the huge,
 tall pillar of light as it tore up the air the moment it connected with
 the collector boom up high.
 And then the ear-splitting boom, the echo of a star being born, assaulted
 them.
 Copun put his hands on his ears and let the harness carry his weight, while
 Serandito looked skyward as the windcomb shot suddenly forward, like a
 comet, plowing through wild space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the windcomb steadied it's course, multiple stabilizers corrected its
