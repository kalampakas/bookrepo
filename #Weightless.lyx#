\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
My name is Serandito Carival.
 I'm only writing it down because people often hear a story, whether it
 was real or not and wonder, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who did that
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Some might suspect I'm using an alias, others will point out that a name
 doesn't really matter.
 They would all be wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I am Serandito Carival and I'm proud of the things I've done, thankful of
 the memories I've kept and always fearful of the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
That is why I'm writing this, all of this.
 Because you must learn the truth of it all and pass it on to those that
 come after you, generation after generation, like a fable, like a myth.
 But never forget it was all true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because lies are what brought us on the path to extinction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I'm fearful it could all happen again.
 From the records and annals that have been restored in my time, it almost
 certainly happens again.
 That fear of mine, should become your fear as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because fear, as I will explain, can be a very useful tool.
 And you must know how to wield it, as well as live with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
There will be a time, in the future, when these writings - in whatever form
 - will be no more.
 It has been known, since almost ancient times, that the stars will wither
 and vanish, others more prominently than some.
 But still, the universe will die and along with it, every kind of life
 that populates it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
But mankind has to persevere in spite of that.
 Promise me this, as I in turn shall promise you:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
At the last light of the last star, there will be a man there to see it
 through to nothingness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Why, you might ask?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Picture it, I urge you.
 Hold that picture in your mind, make it a part of who you are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because that picture is all that stands between life and a fate far worse
 than death: Oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Maybe you're confused by now; perhaps I'm coming off as a cryptic stranger
 or as I've been called many times, a madman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I am simply a zealot.
 My aim is to turn you, whoever you are, into a zealot as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Since you're reading this, I'm either part of history, or something terrible
 has happened again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Read and learn my friend.
 And remember that Serandito Carival is just a name.
 But me, and you, we're more than that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
We're humans.
 Never forget that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
-- Serandito Carival, 
\shape italic
The death of our race

Is this all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Copun under a wheezy breath, his forehead glistening with sweat.
 Serandito nodded with a grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thirteen stacks in all.
 If we must meet the quota, we need another twelve by sunrise.
 Think you're up to it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun was trying hard not to show he was spent for the day; he put on a
 big hearty smile and after a couple of deep breaths turned around and headed
 back to the windcomb.
 He shouted at Serandito playfully, mischief drawn on his thick eyebrows:
\end_layout

\end_inset

You'll be the death of me, Sera.
 Once we're done, you're treating me to some of your jeral, you hear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito shook his head and let out a knowing laugh.
 He put his hands on his waist and took a moment to marvel at the land around
 them; harvest time.
 A golden sea swayed nimbly in front of him, lit up with the purple hues
 of the setting sun.
 He could almost see the first stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you coming or will you just stand there? Ain't nothing you haven't seen,
 Sera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito smiled broadly before starting off towards the hovering harvester
 with a quick, almost joyful pace.
 He jumped inside the windcomb's gondola, causing it to bob and jerk slightly
 before he answered with a weird smirk on his face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would it be a real shame if I missed something new, Copun?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun reached out of the gondola, threw a bag of glowbees in the air and
 drew the anchor slowly.
 Hunched over one side of the gondola, he said without turning:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There hasn't been anything new around here since man set foot on this place,
 Sera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He heaved the last of the anchor on the deck with some strain and said without
 a hint of irony:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's the beauty of it; nothing really changes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The glowbees were up and about, flying around the windcomb, following a
 familiar pattern of their own.
 Their luminescent bellies lit up the gondola with a soft, warm orange light
 as they swarmed around it like slow-twirling flakes of bright snow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito looked around him one last time as if failing to find something
 that caught his imagination, nodded to Copun and jibbed the sail with one
 expert, crisp motion.
 The windcomb tacked gracefully against the first duskward gusts for the
 night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thirty-four C?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked while keeping an eye out for a good, strong buffet of wind out
 on the never-ending plain that stretched before them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, thirty-four C,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun without so much as a thought and sat down near the controller's
 seat, his back against a thin, metal rail.
 He sighed and slid a small toolbox nearby in front of his feet.
 He opened it and fussed around inside with both hands for a moment.
 At length, Copun's eyes lit up with a radiant gaze at the sight of a small,
 tin-like, container.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll just have a whiff.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito's disapproving stare fell on Copun.
 He said nothing at first, while the older man tapped on a pipe and filled
 it with finely-cut brown-black leaves, a genuine smile on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank the Protectors for the small luxuries of life, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Copun, lighting up his pipe with a sprinkle of 'golic and puffing
 at it wildly until a sweet, heavy aroma wafted around the gondola.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito took the seat next to the controller's, and touched some of the
 controls on the grimy, dusty panel.
 He shook his head slightly but said nothing.
 Copun took another draught from his pipe and said with a slight drawl:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It won't kill me now, boy.
 It's only quazza, to ease the mind, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito looked at him with a sour expression.
 It was one of the old man's worst habits and he simply would not let it
 go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know what it is, Copun.
 Your mind is filled with uneasiness? Again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito and scoffed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The toils of life, Serandito my boy.
 When you are my age, they start to pile up impossibly high,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Copun with an almost deliberately drunken smile.
 The quazza had started to set in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That thing clouds the mind, Copun.
 It makes everything hazy, muddied.
 Just like when in a fog.
 Shouldn't you at least wait until after we're done with our quota?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun made it a point to look behind his shoulder, to let his gaze wonder
 around the windcomb for a while.
 He smiled wryly and threw his head back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see no fog creeping up on us.
 You just do the sailing, and let me worry about my own troubles.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't like it one bit, Copun.
 That's proper poison inside your soul, right there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Serandito, worried anger in his words.
 Copun couldn't help but laugh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The soul? Have you been prying around Old Man Legget's? That devil could
 get you in trouble and you wouldn't even know it till you're strapped down
 on that slave chair.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun's smile wavered for a bit, before he took a long, hard stare at Serandito.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a good man to talk to, Copun.
 You should have a couple of cups of jeral with him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ain't that a poison too now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Copun, the wrinkles on his forehead adding a sense of wonder to
 his smiling, curly lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito nodded fervently, realising he had been at fault to judge.
 He said with a shake of his head, his eyes watching the main sail ripple
 with the rising wind.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It opens up the spirits to roam about freely.
 Weren't you the one that asked for a treat as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copun exhaled, thin snake-like trails of smoke carried away from his nostrils
 as the windcomb picked up more speed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, one can't expect to go away from this world as pure as one came, Sera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I guess not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Serandito and settled into a well-trained series of motions, adjusting
 the trim of the sail and making sure they were speeding along nicely in
 the right direction.
 Copun fell into silence, hands crossed behind his back, the quazza on his
 pipe almost gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito cherished these moments of silence, the sound of the rippling
 sails and the buffeting wind in harmony with the soft light of the bees,
 while all around them the murky shadows of faint starlight held fast, an
 unyielding river of darkness flowing between them and the grain stalks
 only a few feet below.
