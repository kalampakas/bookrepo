\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
My name is Serandito Carival.
 I'm only writing it down because people often hear a story, whether it
 was real or not and wonder, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who did that
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Some might suspect I'm using an alias, others will point out that a name
 doesn't really matter.
 They would all be wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I am Serandito Carival and I'm proud of the things I've done, thankful of
 the memories I've kept and always fearful of the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
That is why I'm writing this, all of this.
 Because you must learn the truth of it all and pass it on to those that
 come after you, generation after generation, like a fable, like a myth.
 But never forget it was all true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because lies are what brought us on the path to extinction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I'm fearful it could all happen again.
 From the records and annals that have been restored in my time, it almost
 certainly happens again.
 That fear of mine, should become your fear as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because fear, as I will explain, can be a very useful tool.
 And you must know how to wield it, as well as live with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
There will be a time, in the future, when these writings - in whatever form
 - will be no more.
 It has been known, since almost ancient times, that the stars will wither
 and vanish, others more prominently than some.
 But still, the universe will die and along with it, every kind of life
 that populates it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
But mankind has to persevere in spite of that.
 Promise me this, as I in turn shall promise you:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
At the last light of the last star, there will be a man there to see it
 through to nothingness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Why, you might ask?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Picture it, I urge you.
 Hold that picture in your mind, make it a part of who you are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Because that picture is all that stands between life and a fate far worse
 than death: Oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Maybe you're confused by now; perhaps I'm coming off as a cryptic stranger
 or as I've been called many times, a madman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
I am simply a zealot.
 My aim is to turn you, whoever you are, into a zealot as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Since you're reading this, I'm either part of history, or something terrible
 has happened again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
Read and learn my friend.
 And remember that Serandito Carival is just a name.
 But me, and you, we're more than that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\shape italic
We're humans.
 Never forget that.

Is this all?

 said Copun under a wheezy breath, his forehead glistening with sweat.
 Serandito nodded with a grin.

Thirteen stacks in all.
 If we must meet the quota, we need another twelve by sunrise.
 Think you're up to it?

\begin_layout Standard
Copun was trying hard not to show he was spent for the day; he put on a
 big hearty smile and after a couple of deep breaths turned around and headed
 back to the windcomb.
 He shouted at Serandito playfully, mischief drawn on his thick eyebrows:

You'll be the death of me, Sera.
 Once we're done, you're treating me to some of your jeral, you hear?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito shook his head and let out a knowing laugh.
 He put his hands on his waist and took a moment to marvel at the land around
 them; harvest time.
 A golden sea swayed nimbly in front of him, lit up with the purple hues
 of the setting sun.
 He could almost see the first stars.
\end_layout

Are you coming or will you just stand there? Ain't nothing you haven't seen,
 Sera.

\begin_layout Standard
Serandito smiled broadly before starting off towards the harvester with
 a quick, almost joyful pace.
 He was quick to answer as he jumped inside the windcomb's gondola, causing
 it to bob and jerk slightly:

Would it be a real shame if I missed something new, Copun?

\begin_layout Standard
Copun reached out of the gondola, threw a bag of glowbees in the air and
 drew the anchor slowly.
 Hunched over one side of the gondola, he said without turning:

There hasn't been anything new around here since man set foot on this place,
 Sera.

He heaved the last of the anchor on the deck with some strain and said without
 a hint of irony:

That's the beauty of it; nothing really changes.

Serandito nodded and yanked the jib, setting the sail to tack against the
 first gusts of the night from duskward.

Thirty-four C, Copun?

 he asked while keeping an eye out for a good, strong buffet of wind out
 on the never-ending plain that stretched before them.
\end_layout

Yeah, thirty-four C,

 said Copun without so much as a thought, and sat down, his back against
 a thin, metal rail.
