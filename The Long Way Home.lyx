\begin_layout Standard
The sound of small, shuffling feet roused Penthesileia from an uneasy, troubled
 sleep.
 She rolled to the other side of her bed and slowly opened her eyes; she
 saw Heraclea standing by the bedside in the dim blueish light of the glowstrips.
 The child's face was pale white and taut with fright.
 Her mouth was half-open, as if her scream had been sucked into the silent
 void.
\end_layout

Hush now, child.
 Hush and worry not.
 I'm here now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Penthesileia in her daughter's ear, her arms wrapped around the
 little girl like a warm coccoon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She felt Heraclea's shallow breath and her fragile body's tremors; chills
 ran down her spine.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Heraclea stifling a sob, barely able to contain a rush of tears.
 She rubbed a runny nose against her mother's chest and looked at her with
 heart-melting innocence.
\end_layout

\end_inset

He's in orbit my love, you know that already.
 Come, lay beside me and nothing will hurt you, I promise,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Penthesileia but her eyes grew distant suddenly.
 She stared at a pot plant behind her daughter's back.
 It had large drooped leaves and creamy rose buds; it served no purpose
 other than beautification.
 It was contraband.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A thought entered her mind unbidden:

He could be frozen stiff, floating outside an airlock.
 Nothing will hurt you, Hera.

Father promised too,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the child, her voice fading away crestfallen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your father loves you more than anything,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Penthesileia and swallowed hard.
 She added hastily, and even tried to smile reassuringly:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's coming soon, Hera.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She heard her falsetto voice through her own ears; the lie pierced her soul
 like a blade made of glass, shattering inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She closed her eyes and grabbed Heraclea from her shoulders, as if trying
 to fix her to the floor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your father and I love you more than the stars in the night sky; more than
 the galaxy and the universe itself.
 Do you understand that, Hera? Remember that; more than life, love.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is life worth anyway on this forsaken rock, she thought and kissed
 her daughter's forehead, feeling the cold taste of dried sweat.
 The child looked at her expectantly, fear creasing her brow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I love you too mother.
 But I'm scared.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's alright, Hera.
 Everyone's scared.
 We're only human,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Penthesileia with a slight sigh and looked outside their small window
 pane; the moons were fading away, while a trio of suns came rising spectacularl
y, the horizon an unearthly rainbow of golden-hued colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What do you mean, mother?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Heraclea puzzled, the fear subsiding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Nothing love.
 Come here now.
 Lay on the bed, close your eyes and think of riding the sail.

And father at the helm?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked the little girl as she climbed eagerly on the bed, a carefree smile
 sheepishly forming on her mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Always, my love,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Penthesileia.
 She clutched her daughter in her arms like a hawk-mother and felt a tear
 ran down her cheek.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She looked through her window at the rich, crystal clear horizon.
 The break of dawn was at hand; she saw the Hyperion shining brightly, moving
 slowly across the sky like a star with purpose.

The guard chuckled and drew his chair closer to the cell.
 He looked at Philetus inquisitively before cocking his head sideways, as
 if trying to peer past some sort of facade.

You intrigue me, Pedagogue.
 You're a peculiar man.

And you're strangely inquisitive for a simple guard, I'll grant you that.

Head? Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are no guards in this place except

Hope was my crime as well.

I merely entertain my time, Pedagogue.
 Save your words for the Tribunal.

I find it strange that they haven't gagged my mouth.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've heard madmen and heretics muse about the end of days and the fall of
 the firmament before.
 I sometimes think back to some of it and I smile.
 It is an otherwise unfulfilling job.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Allow me then.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guard nodded and sat back on his desk's hovering chair.
 From across the hallway, a man in a holding cell cried out hysterically:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a demon! An alien if I've ever seen one!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

If that's true, our work here is done, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

He'll boil your mind away with his words! I've seen it, I have!

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right next to the miners you spaced, I'm sure.
 Save it, Barabbas,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the guard and flicking a switch on his desk all sound from Barabba's
 cell was nullified.
 He yelled and threw himself around the cell until he realised it was futile
 and simply sat himself down, muttering to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Fourteen people spaced out on the belt.
 Miners and their families.
 He said he had to stop them from killing the asteroid.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Has he been sentenced?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not yet, but it's a clear cut case.
 He can't be slaved, he's paranoid; it's either the airlock or the compost
 in the Fields.
 What would you pick?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd prefer to be slaved.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

That's not life either, Pedagogue.
 Surely you know that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

Maybe somehow I can talk some sense into them all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

I thought the Tribunal had no need of those.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

I wouldn't know.

 Perhaps they find it amusing.
 Perhaps they're bored.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

They are machines.
 They have no mind to speak of.

You don't like them very much, do you? We owe everything we've accomplished
 to them, don't we? Our very existence.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I refuse to believe that.
 We owe nothing to ancient machines built to rule our lives in the name
 of mankind.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I've heard about your kind.
 The philosophers, is that what you call yourselves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've hardly heard the notion, haven't you? That's their doing.
 Keeping knowledge locked away; nothing but the maths and science of engineering
 that we need to build more refineries, more mines, more ships.
 So we can then launch blindly into the galaxy, and turn more of it into
 resources, materials.
 Eat away at it, expanding like a scourge, a colourless plague.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can't see why that should bother you.
 What else is the universe there for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, how the mighty have fallen low.
 To believe we once set ourselves towards the star with a single dream,
 a wonderful purpose.
 And how we've allowed ourselves to drift away, fall into such a lonely,
 deaf and mute abyss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Your words make little sense; you talk as if in riddles.
 You puzzle me pedagogue.
 I know not what to really make of you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If you haven't already seen it yourself, there's little I could say to make
 you see the truth of it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that why you told the children? Is that what you taught them? Is that
 what hoped to seed in their hearts and minds? Dissidence, rebellion? Whatever
 for, Pedagogue? I do not understand.
 Are we not cared for? Are we not protected? Do we not live comfortable,
 sheltered lives? Here we are, thousands of light years away from our homeworld,
 claiming new worlds, seeking intelligent life, unleashing humanity into
 the stars.
 What more could a man ask for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Choice, for one.
 Freedom.
 Expression.
 Art, passion, love and so many more of the things we've let them erase

We need the genetic pool, you know that.
 And neutering alters physiology, there are neurochemical imbalances to

 No chronic diseases, no deformities, no lesser beings.

The Head of the Guards opened his cell.
 He was wearing a lightweight powered suit of armor.
 It made him look austere and unyielding; it was because the visor was oblique.
 If it hadn't been so, one would have easily seen a confused, puzzled man

 He was holding a batton in one hand; it hummed quietly due to an intense
 electric field around its tip.

Philetus shook his head and rose from his simple metal cot.
 His hands were uncomfortably held together by heavy metal manacles, locked
 in place by large bars and bolts, impossible to escape by merely sleight
 of hand.
 Philetus walked outside under the watchful eye of the guard, while Barabbas
 screamed and shouted mute obscenities behind his sound-nullified cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guard afforded him a mere warning finger and a heavy stare; he turned
 around and led Philetus towards the exit.
 A panel by the door blurted in an undoubtedly synthetic, male voice, blatantly
 devoid of emotion:

Verify.

\begin_layout Standard
The guard placed a palm on the surface of the panel while he opened his
 visor and stared at an optical sensor.
 Moments later, the panel blurted with the ting of metal in its voice:

Sustar Saul, Head of Guards.
 Verified.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door opened nearly without a sound, revealing a utilitarian, spartan
 corridor only a few feet wide.
 Non-descript illuminated panels of white plastic formed the walls; the
 end of the corridor was obscured in total darkness.
 Philetus turned to Sustar and said with a keen, wholly unnerving smile.
\end_layout

It does not suit you at all, Saul.

Philetus nodded once more and said nothing.
 He stepped into the corridor with Sustar right behind him.
 The floor was made out of the same plastic as the walls.
 Its surface was rigid, yet unblemished.
 Every step of the way, Philetus felt his feet stick to the floor; it somehow
 made it impossible for someone to slip and fall.

Their steps made no sound; in front of them they could see no more than

They were leaving behind them corridors and gangways, doorways and chambers

 Thousands of years old, yet no-one had trod on them since.
 It wasn't needed; it wasn't allowed.

\begin_layout Standard
They reached a recess, an open archway that led into a shaft of sorts.
 It was kept in the dark, but the faint trace of a simple girded ladder
 glinted off the ambient light of the corridor.
 Sustar pointed through the archway with his free hand:

Philetus glanced at Sustar and saw nothing behind his black oblique visor.
 He complied and grabbed the ladder.
 He felt Sustar right behind him, urging him to move.
 He took a few hesitant steps, failing to see where he should put his hands
 and legs.
 Suddenly the darkness dissolved.
 Philetus turned his head to look down and was almost blinded; Sustar had
 turned on the helmet's lights.
 He merely motioned `up' with a finger.
 Philetus looked upwards and saw a faint glimmer of light at the end of
 a very long, very lonely tunnel.

 replied Sustar, the connotations of the phrase lost or ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philetus shook his head and climbed; he gradually felt lighter the farther
 up they travelled.
 That meant they were going towards the center of the ship, not towards
 the bridge.
 The faint light grew steadily.
 It puzzled him; he felt a sudden pang of instinctive fear in his chest
 and stomach.

 asked Philetus with an angst he had never thought he'd exhibit in his life.

Sustar shrugged, the bulk of his suit barely fitting inside the crampy tunnel.

\begin_layout Standard
Philetus nodded, sighed and went on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pinprick of light had turned into a warm, soft glow in front of him.
 He felt light as a feather now.
 He pushed on the ladder with both hands and suddenly let go; he floated
 upwards as if diving gracefully towards the exit, no further than a dozen
 or so feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wait! You pushed too hard!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Sustar and scrambled right behind him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philetus was suddenly bathed in a warm reddish light that seemed to change
 hue languidly.
 An enormous space unfolded around him, a network of antennae, cables and
 pipes lining its walls.
 A fabulously engineered, metallic skin.
 At both ends, giant blueish cubes could be seen, stacked on top of each
 other, emanating swaths of iridescent light.
 The whole empty chamber seemed to rotate around him at a comfortable speed.
 The light danced around him, hugging him with care; Philetus felt that
 riding the mythical rainbow of Terra could not have been more beautiful
 than this.

 cubes.

 described like heaven.

 said Sustar as he untied the bolts, removed the bars and opened the manacles;
 they floated away towards the walls as if searching for the walls on their
 own.
 Philetus was looking around him baffled, mesmerized.
 His voice, little more than a whisper; faint undertones of awe echoed uncannily.

 said a disembodied, sweet female voice and in an instant the ghostly grey

 of them.
 Philetus frowned and instinctively tried to step back in vain; he hadn't
 really adjusted to floating in microgravity.
