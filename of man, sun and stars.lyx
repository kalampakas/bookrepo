Will you make up your mind already?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the bulky man to the small group of interested though taciturn buyers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trio of men wore black, unadorned exo-suits.
 Optical augmentations of varying quality featured prominently on their
 faces.
 They had been meticulously examining the article on sale for what seemed
 to be an inordinate amount of time, while one of them had communicated
 a single word.
 Neither spoken nor transmitted, in any single language or wavelength.
 Gretchetna was evidently growing impatient, and put down his chopsticks
 and bowl of arsubuta before assuming a faintly sour expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It might be the pork, but I'm smelling something sour.
 If you're here to waste my time, buzz off.
 If you're here to buy, then buy.
 Am I getting through to you? Is your auvosense busted or something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The irate commentary did not appear to have much of an effect on them, nor
 the rude gestures that accompanied it.
 These by no means ordinary customers seemed to be looking for something
 particular, running meticulous scans with some kind of sensory equipment
 that looked delicate, expensive and very sensitive all at once.
 They had largely ignored Gretchetna and that was perhaps the real reason
 he looked like he was about to explode from frustration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He decided it was about time he made his point a little more convincing,
 so he reached for his amada gun below the counter, and clicked the on switch.
 The characteristic low-pitched harmonics were heard, and the trio were
 suddenly but calmly becoming aware that some kind of important event had
 just occurred.
 They momentarily stopped fiddling with their equipment and the box on sale,
 and slowly lifted their heads to look at Gretchetna.
 A radiant smile had appeared on his face, and he seemed to be enjoying
 the fact that he finally had their attention, even for a little while:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You said you wanted a look-see.
 Fine, you looked at it.
 You can probably just make a copy by now, with all that scanning.
 The point is, are you buying? 'Cause if you're not, I'd like to be compensated
 either way.
 I got a Lambda-Lambda here which says you'd be happy to reimburse me, unless
 you feel strangely attracted to plasma projectiles.
 Still want to play dumb and mute?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trio exchanged some silent, unemotional looks.
 One of them made a small step forward, his hands half-raised in a non-threateni
ng gesture.
 For the first time, he spoke with a dry voice and a heavy mandarin accent:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We do not wish to buy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gretchetna's smile widened to an impossible grin and he aimed the LL-type
 amada gun directly to the small-framed man:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you wish to be evaporated? I don't mind the cleaning-up later.
 Pay up.
 Next thing I know, you'll be selling these cheaper than hamps.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We wish to destroy it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gretchetna's fingers twiddled with the side-switch settings, amping the
 power to the megawatt scale.
 The humming noise from the amada gun became a loud buzz, an onerous cacophony
 that usually implied something was about to catch on fire, explode, or
 probably both.
 The moustache on Gretchetna's face seemed to droop somewhat, barely moving
 with each word:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pay up first, buddy.
 Last chance before you get to see the Big Bang from real up close and personal.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All three men were facing Gretchetna now with hands outstretched, as if
 they wanted to show they meant no harm.
 Their palms seemed to glow faintly.
 The one who had spoken up first, continued:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You have been tainted.
 This is nothing personal.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gretchetna had time enough to see the glow from their hands turn into a
 searing beam of light.
 His unaugmented nervous system barely had time enough to let his finger
 squeeze the lambda-lambda's button.
 The superconducted mass driver unit on the amada gun started discharging,
 accelerating the tungsten-beryllium projectile to near-escape velocity.
 The tiny projectile turned into plasma, illuminating the shady emporium
 of Gretchetna as if an exotic aurora had manifested itself.
 At the same time, a searing pulse of light came out of the men's palms,
 a blinding blue and white illuminiscence filling the space between them
 and Gretchetna.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When his body hit the floor, there was no blood to speak of.
 There was, in fact, no sign of Gretchetna's upper torso.
 The three men though, seemed quite unharmed.
 There was a passing smell of ozone, and the quite distinct acridity of
 burnt human flesh.
 As the three men once again approached the box, this time they each produced
 a small metal object, each different in shape and size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them made a sudden alarmed motion with his head and an intricate
 sign with one hand.
 The one who had spoken before did so again, his voice unnatural, icy and
 dry:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Assemble the device.
 I will take care of that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While he started walking towards the entrance to Gretchetna's emporium,
 the two other men complied with speed and precision.
 They made adjustments to the metal objects with their hands.
 The pieces interlocked, a perfect fit.
 Then, they placed the resulting object on the box that was so misleadingly
 plain and ordinary that Gretchetna had been using it as a bench.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The large emporium echoed suddenly with the massive thumping and ricocheting
 sounds of a hail of bullet rounds.
 Immediately, they stepped right in front of the path of some incoming stray
 shots to protect the device they had just assembled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crude and cheap, kinetics were quite efficient for most rough types of troublema
kers.
 To Vic's surprise though, these men were not the usual kind.
 Vic had just unloaded a full box of 20mm caseless on them, and they had
 actually got in the way on purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, fuck me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Vic said quietly to himself, the twin muzzle from his CK-auto making the
 air sizzle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instinctively scrambling to reload, Vic didn't have a chance to see the
 blurry shadow that hit him with enough force for his ribcage to shatter
 and his body to be send flying across the emporium, only to have his neck
 broken on impact with the aerogel walls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Momentarily assessing the badly light corridor outside, the talkative member
 of the trio asked the other two:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is the Exagrammaton aligned?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had been merely looking at the box and the device attached to in a
 sort of hallowed silence.
 After a small amount of time had passed, as if they counted every millisecond
 with atomic precision, they replied as one man, with one voice and one
 mind, as if they were nothing but automatons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Exagrammaton is aligned.
 What about the rest of them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Trivial,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the one they seemed to defer to as their leader replied, while the the
 one who had never spoken a word said with what a careful voice stress analysis
 could identify as a hint of worry:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Leave now, and let us remain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man who had led Gretchetna and Vic to their untimely deaths, was now
 wearing a grin that felt completely out of place with the rest of his face,
 as if someone had painted a smile on a jagged piece of granite:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A touch of Anxiety, Dispatcher?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which the man promptly answered while bowing his head only slightly,
 an almost imperceptible gesture of subservience:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Only for success, Exchequer.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man they called Exchequer nodded briskly and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Move.
 We are done here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then suddenly turned into a transparent shadowy figure that challenged
 any eye, even augmented ones, to an impossible task.
 The other two men also seemed to quickly vanish into a wispy shade, and
 then they blended into nothingness.
 Even their footsteps seemed to be echoes of ghosts.
 The only sound that could be heard was the repeating welcome message, blowing
 over the ceiling soundbands, in a rugged but hearty voice:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam smiled with a slight hint of irony before assuming a business-like manner
 and answering with a voice that could have easily belonged to a first-gen
 android, flat and almost emotionless except for boredom and the occasional
 hint of irony:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought noticing stuff was your job, detective Bodereau.
 Two victims.
 One and a half, actually.
 The one behind the reinforced bench is semi-evaporated.
 High-yield high-frequency lasers, most likely.
 The other one seems beaten to death.
 Got a broken neck.
 Medbots are sweeping for the details you never really care about.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bodereau's gaze ran around the points of interest that Sam, the forensics
 officer, had brought up.
 He seemed to look around as if he was another customer, and not the detective
 on the case.
 After a small period of silence, he asked Sam, his words heavy with dissapointm
ent, floating on the vapors of cheap liquor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's it? No DNA on the perps? Something I could use so I can post a warrant
 and let the 'forcers handle it? Doesn't seem they wanted to keep the place
 clean..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam lit up a cigarette, the homegrown-in-orbit variety, which made Bodereau
 reach out and grab it from his mouth just when he was taking his first
 draw.
 Sam instantly became pretty full of emotion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey! Hey! Fuck you Bodereau!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's bullshit.
 As if someones care for a smuggler like Gretchetna and the likes of him.
 Who probably wiped him cause he owed them money.
 Or because he owed them, same deal.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want my job, Sam? Cause if you got it all figured out, I can go home,
 and you can fill in the blanks, do the monthly report and yeah, you can
 have my implant too.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm fine with letting the robots cut up corpses, thank you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So stick to your end, then.
 Gretchetna had a good name, as good a name as they come down here.
 Every dealer in the market has had tradings with him, and word is he kept
 his word, which in this line of business is like sainthood or something.
 I don't think his esteemed colleagues did it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detective Bodereau started to stroll around the emporium, noticing the signs
 of the firefight: intense heat marks from the amada gun, chipped off blocks
 of aerogel and polysteel from the kinetics, clean-cut holes from the lasers.
 Not much in the way of looting, which only made him pause and think.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The medbots were hovering a few feet away, humming like worker bees, their
 sound unobtrusive yet prevalent.
 At length, Bodereau took notice of the box lying almost in the middle of
 the emporium, not far from Gretchetna's bench.
 Sam had moved over to one corner, trying to light up another cigarette
 without being noticed, taking advantage of Bodereau's unusually deep thinking.
 Even while Sam savoured the first few puffs, Bodereau started talking without
 taking the box out of his gaze:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you hear that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam looked at Bodereau with confusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What, the medbots?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bodereau had his eyes fixed on the box.
 His voice came out suddenly diminished, faint and trembling:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The voices, Sam.
 Can't you hear them?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam furrowed his brow in disbelief.
 He then nodded and grinned, the cigarette hanging from his lips:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Medical discharge on grounds of mental instability.
 Can you put on a good act for the tribunal?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bodereau became strangely drawn to the box, running his hands around it,
 almost caressing it as he would a marvellous sculpture or the body of a
 beautiful woman.
 He seemed to revere it, as if it was something hallowed.
 The sight alone gave Sam a chill down his spine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can cut the crap, Bodereau.
 The tribunal won't eat it up.
 You'll get the Farm for that kind of bullshit, not a discharge.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can hear them, Sam.
 They're wonderful.
 They're so vibrant.
 So real.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam dropped his cigarette and put it out.
 He walked towards Bodereau, his expression a mix of anger and worry, the
 grin extinguished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bodereau, what the fuck? Snap out of it.
 Are you on something? It's bad enough with the drinking, don't tell me
 you started doing trippers or sky now.
 Hey, man.
 Look at me when I'm talking to you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bodereau did not turn to face Sam.
 Nor did he stop his weird show of adoration towards the box.
 Sam still felt he was looking at a bad practical joke.
 Bodereau became ever more attractede to the box, almost hugging it now.
 Sam took a deep breath and punched him on the face.
 Bodereau calmly took the hit, and started mumbling.
 His eyes had now taken an otherworldly gleem, their focus somewhere beyond
 the walls of the emporium.
 Sam was now starting to worry.
 In fact, he felt an uncanny sensation of fear across his spine.
 He took a step back before touching his armband's interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He quickly selected the Emergency tab, and then brought up the Officer Assistanc
e dialog.
 He selected two enforcer droids and a class-II medbot, complete with table
 and restraining harness.
 This was not an act, he now knew.
 Bodereau seemed to have snapped like a twig, in the blink of an eye.
 Perhaps it shouldn't come as a shock, with all of Bodereau's history and
 psych profile.
 But to see a man break down just like that, was enlightening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam felt a sadness and pity he did not think himself capable of.
 Then, as he stood there, near the mumbling, hunched form of Detective Bodereau,
 he heard a voice.
 It was the voice of an angel, or perhaps the voice of the heavens.
 It was a sweet melody, not a voice.
 There were no words, only chords of blissful sounds.
 It was like everything around him vibrated with music.
 He could still see Bodereau hugging the box as if they were lovers, his
 lips moving endlessly to a rhythm that now Sam could understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was joyous.
 It was an answer.
 The answer to everything.
 It felt like everything could be explained, that everything could have
 an absolute, infallible meaning.
 The sensation of wonder was mind-numbing.
 Sam could now see more clearly than ever.
 He could now feel everything in dizzying detail.
 A cosmic awareness seemed to envelop him, and caress his heart and mind
 like only a mother would know how.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he heard a clear voice, bright and mellow like the sun:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you have us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam felt tears of running down his cheeks, like icy rivulets on desert bedrock.
 He still possessed a clarity of mind and self to ask in his mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about Bodereau? What about me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The voice then spoke with a timbre that could noone could resist to hear
 in awe and tearful marvel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He is spent.
 You are not.
 Will you have us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam closed his eyes and accepted, in what he believed was his last act of
 free will.
 He knew then, he had no other choice.
 As the enforcer droids entered the emporium with the medbot in their trail,
 Sam disappeared as if he had never been there, as if he was less than a
 mere illusion.
 Along with the box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The small device the three men had left behind gave a flash of light, but
 the droids' advanced sensors registered nothing.
 And then a stream of high-energy particles ensued before the orbital was
 obliterated, turning into a cloud of ionized plasma.
 The death shriek of a small star in the sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sam looked up into the bright mauve sky, and saw the small cloud hanging
 like an iridiscent pearl, shining with an ever diminishing glow, until
 nothing but a faint, hazy shadow remained.
 It was still him, he thought.
 And then he heard the voice once again, crystal clear, and much less monumental
ly awe-inspiring:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Welcome to the Exchange, Sam.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He talked to himself then, feeling a strange serenity, as if a huge burden
 had been lifted off his shoulders:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magistrate Keller sat in a simple metal chair opposite Frank Demeris.
 There was the slight sheen of pity in his eyes, but he did not dare show
 it in his voice.
 It was something only Frank should know.
 It'd be against appearances if the judge showed mercy for the killer, the
 abomination, the madman.

Keller stood up and faced the complete darkness around them, as if peering
 through a window on sunny day, admiring the view.
 He sat there silently, hands in his pockets.
 Frank filled the silence:

Frank did not spit out the words.

\begin_layout Standard
Keller came a few steps closer towards the paralyzed form of Frank Demeris.
 He looked him in the eyes then, searching for his friend of old.
 He found a total stranger, and quickly averted his gaze as if he feared
 that whatever had gotten over Frank was somehow contagious.
 It wasn't before long that his eyes wondered to his shiny leather shoes
 once more.

Eden

A soft brown glow outlined the Wall, its sheer size dominating the horizon.
 Sigmund was holding on to his spear, surveying the landscape with a pair

 Upstream he could discern Lake Spagelow dry this time of year, again too

 Still no sign of Jared and Ernst though, he thought to himself.

Sigmund was having second thoughts about leaving them alone, but he insisted

 He couldn't help repeating in his mind, 'What where they thinking anyway?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba, as if exhibiting a rare moment of telepathic skill or simply sticking

 his goggles.
 Its voice seemed uncannily human in its emotion:

Sigmund rested his goggles on his forehead, and took another survey of the
 area.
 Today's storm would hit stronger than yesterday, it seemed to him; it was
 past mid-month and all the signs where there.
 Every kind of what little life existed on Eden was already sensing the
 change in pressure, digging deep and staying covered.
 Even the glow above the Wall was darker than usual.
 A killer storm for certain.
 After all those years, he didn't need a satellite image to tell him that.
 He shook his head in disbelief of what he was about to say, let alone do,
 but he managed to say to the eba:

Sigmund started off with a brisk pace down the trail to the buggy, using
 his spear for support down the grainy sand and rock of the Lookout Hill.
 The eba was faster, its paws churning whiffs of grey-red dirt as it raced
 downhill to get to the buggy first, each time an unofficial race going
 on.
 As Sigmund was coming down the hill he muttered to himself:

The eba was already crouched inside the buggy, its head darting left and
 right for signs of activity, whether it be danger or friends, doing his
 earthly ancestor predators justice.
 Sigmund fastened his spear on some ingeniously designed side latches and
 jumped inside the buggy as well.

Sigmund took a last, quick look behind him and nodded to himself:

\begin_layout Standard
He pushed the start button on the buggy, and the control panel lit up instantly,
 motors and servos whirring while the startup diagnostic ran.
 A few seconds later, they were heading upstream to the lake, at a quick
 pace.
 Riding along the dried up river bed of Musk River the buggy's motor whir
 blended with the sound of metal speeding over chipped pebbles and gravel.
 The buggy and the loose surface were perfectly paired, but plainly comfort
 had not been a design goal.
 It was impossible to compensate for the feeling of sailing over what felt
 like thick rock mud, the buggy frame tilting and swaying but always keeping
 the heading in the intended direction.
 The eba seemed to lack its earlier enthusiasm over what seemed to be its
 own, self-appointed mission.
 Sigmund gazed around the broken landscape for signs of Jared and Ernst
 with no success.
 He took note of the eba's apparent discomfort and asked:
\end_layout

Sigmund's appeal was cut short when the eba could not stand the upheaval
 for much longer before vomiting on the back of the buggy.
 Its facial hair had become soiled and ragged-looking, its look was dreary
 and in no way did it resemble the predator its genetic stock had originated
 from.
 Sigmund started shouting with a modest hint of disgust in his voice:

 the eba with an accusing look:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba straightened its back suddenly, poised as if to strike, its whole
 body a compass indicator leaning on a definite direction.
 Sigmund turned his head and zoomed with the binoculars, the built-in pattern
 recognition trying to identify Jared and Ernst or somekind of human built
 tracks.
 He brought the buggy to an abrupt stop and scanned to their right again,
 this time with more diligence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see them.
 I'll run ahead friend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the eba and casually leaped off the buggy and ran.
 It ate away at the landscape, leaving a brown and silver cloud behind it.
 Sigmund was stunned to silence and paused his search momentarily, taking
 in the sight of the eba speeding towards the Wall.
 The storm was still gathering on their back, on a desert planet twenty
 light years away from Earth, a sky the color of viridian with hues of blue
 and black.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even after all these years, in times like these, Sigmund realised the awe
 that manifested around him and shivered.
 He took a deep breath and put the binoculars back on, now tracking the
 eba as well as two other figures too far away to positively identify them.
 Noone else was due out this far upstream today, none that he knew of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could safely conclude that it was either them or someone equally stupid,
 which would be no small surprise as of late with every number dwindling
 except for the amount of idiots running free.
 Sigmund kicked in the 'sediment' mode on the buggy, and its metal wheels
 - a memory metal - reshaped itself in a thin-faceted, gear-like, Eden-proven
 design.
 A few indicators lit up and the screen showed energy estimates.
 Gobbling down more power than the solar panels could provide, the battery
 would be exhausted before they reached Landing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund snarled something in German and pressed on with the buggy, following
 eba towards the two figures, hoping the emergency fuel cell would be enough.
 He said to noone in particular, for no particular reason:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Sigmund and the eba approached the two young men it seemed they were
 indeed in need of help.
 The eba arrived first and was standing guard, looking out for whatever
 danger might still lurk around.
 The boys seemed in one piece.
 Jared, a thin lad with wiry hair, had met a sand-ant up and close and it
 looked like it wasn't much fun at all.
 He had several cuts and scrapes all over him.
 Possibly a torn calf muscle as well.
 He was limping on his left leg, putting his weight on Ernst both trudging
 along westward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund slid to a stop nearby, and started walking towards the two boys,
 spear in hand, aggravation written across his face.
 He could not help himself chastising the two young men:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So you went too far upstram searching for water.
 And you thought you'd become heroes or something.
 Used up the buggy's power still miles away from Landing and you went on
 foot.
 And got jumped by a sand ant.
 Feel proud for yourselves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jared, the wounded one, immediately retorted, his tanned face looking smoothly
 impervious to any sort of guilt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

You know we need the water and it was a small pack, three of them; we killed
 them all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ernst was sheepishly taking a look at the verbal confrontation, while packing
 their gear on their buggy.
 Sigmund went silent for a few moments, staring at the two boys with an
 uncertain look between anger and worry.
 At length, he pointed an accusing finger at Jared, trying to maintain an
 even though strict tone of voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're naborns and maybe you think you have adjusted better than the rest
 of us, but dying never helped anyone, did it? Killing three sand ants just
 messed you up so you won't be able to work again for at least a couple
 of weeks, and another buggy is lost somewhere out there and someone will
 have to go get it tomorrow, if it survives the storm! And all this to satisfy
 your adolescent craving for pack superiority.
 Very much so like animals! As if growing hair meant you've grown brains!
 Did you ever pause to think?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comment about the animals spurred some heavy eyebrow movement and piercing
 eye shots from the eba towards Sigmund, but once he shot back an even glance,
 it quickly retrained its attention towards safeguarding the rest of them
 until they loaded up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what would you have us do, Teacher? Wait around till one of you provides

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vehemence of Jared's last word was such that it struck everyone with
 numbness and amazement.
 Everyone except Sigmund who inspite of himself dropped what he was carrying
 to stand still in front of Jared for just a moment, nostrils covered with
 dirt flaring up.
 Jared sat still but calm, and then his mouth turned into a slight, almost
 childish grin.
 Sigmund slapped him in the face, making Ernst and the eba freeze where
 they stood.
 Jared was dumbfounded; Sigmund had a reputation for being mild-mannered
 and strictly against any form of violence.
 While he was trying to come up with a defying insult, Sigmund kept him
 at pause saying in a calm but determined manner:
\end_layout

I spent one hundred and twenty years in cryogenic storage.
 A hundred and twenty years of still life and REM brain function.

 who think this is fun! While I'm risking my neck looking out for you dimwits
 with a death wish, there's a sandstorm coming that can eat your flesh to
 the bone, and you have the audacity to call me a coward.
 How I wish I really was one and never stepped foot in here in the first
 place.
 Stayed back on Earth, do a round trip to the Jupiter belt and write a book.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment of stillness ensued, their gaze interlocking and reapproving one
 another.
 Jared measured Sigmund's stare and tone.
 He seemed to accept his place, at least for now.

Ernst picked up the last of their gear and equipment and fastened it to
 the buggy, which was now looking very much like a metallic pack mule, minus
 the rustic charm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund sat in the driver's seat and started the buggy's motor, checking
 power gauges and estimations, selecting Landing's position on the map and
 at the same time answering Jared:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jared remained silent, even though the look on his face implied he was itching
 to utter some sort of retort.
 With the help of Ernst he made his way to the buggy and sat quite uncomfortably
 among the heap of gear, his face contorting with pain.
 Ernst hadn't spoken a word but his eyes showed how relieved he felt to
 be sitting down again, no claws at his back trying to rip him apart.
 He closed his eyes and made a small gesture to the sun with one palm, a
 newly found custom with superstitious overtones that the science being
 taught to the boys had not been able to discourage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund took notice; such overtly religious phenomena seemed to be on the
 rise.
 He decided to further enquire Ernst about it, at a more appropriate time.
 For the moment, the pressing issue was getting back to Landing as dast
 as possible.

\begin_layout Standard
The eba took a last glancing look daywards into the direction of the storm
 and gracefully leapt in the buggy next to Sigmund, managing to curl up
 and fit nicely in a space designed for a human buttock.
 Sigmund hit the emergency power button on the screen, and the buggy lurched
 forward with a sudden acceleration far greater than normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dirt,gravel, and rock were being spewn back from the buggy's wheels which
 covered ground with astonishing speed.
 Sigmund glanced around to his back and saw the storm front finally appear
 within eyesight range.
 The closer they got to Landing the darker the sky and cooler the atmosphere
 became.
 The air was thick with sand and dust; the approaching overpressure of the
 daily sandstorm making itself felt on their skin.
 Sigmund connected with Landing's cavemaster:

The brief chatter was enough for everyone involved to realise that if they

 answered the eba.
 Sigmund's sarcasm was lost on the intelligent, but socially somewhat inept
 creature.
 The biological engineers hadn't been able to compensate for sarcasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The storm was now clearly visible hurling itself at the Wall with little
 more than three hundred miles per hour.
 Sigmund's info panels gave an estimation of a minute and a half before
 it hit Landing and they were a minute out.
 He could make out the C2 gate from that distance, wide open with the emergency
 lights flashing like pearly diamonds in a rugged stone setting.
 That meant every second counted.
 The eba somehow knew; it took it upon itself to help as best as it could,
 and leapt off suddenly.
 It started running a bit behind the buggy and shouting over the din of
 the metal wheels:

Jared and Ernst were drawn to the sight of the cat running like they had
 never seen before, every muscle and joint moving with a fluid certainty,
 a vivid show of harmony, brimming with energy and power.
 But it was not enough, the eba could not catch up with the electric motors
 of the buggy, which were already running beyond design capacity, threatening
 to burn up before they reached Landing.
 Alerts were flashing across the buggy's panel, providing Sigmund ample
 opportunities for cursing, along with the audible beeps and calm warnings
 in English, Chinese, Russian, and French.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And right behind them, no more than five miles behind, they could see the
 storm front, a bleak wall of sand hurtling at them with a mindless rage
 only a thing of nature could endow itself with.
 They were nightside now, at the dusky side where Landing sat, the gates
 only a few hundred meters before them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Above all the sound warnings and the grating sound of the wheels on sharp
 granite gravel, the voice of Dave was heard:

\begin_layout Standard
Seconds right after the buggy passed through the gates, they closed tightly
 shut.
 Huge hydraulic bars locked in place right behind the door, with a slow
 grinding noise.
 Sigmund stopped the buggy near one end of the large cave.
 Smoke with an acrid smell was coming out of the wheels, while Ernst helped
 Jared to a nearby workbench.
 Sigmund got out of the buggy with the whole ordeal seemingly having weighted
 him down.
 With slow motions he picked up his spear and his backpack.
 He shot a weary look at Jared and Ernst, who did not return it and rather
 went about unloading the buggy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that moment they felt the storm hit the Wall, reverberating through the
 rock, grazing the doors of the gate.
 Cave Two was filled with echoes of an otherworldly din, and a shallow sound
 like hissing dominated the largely empty space.
 A metal door with a revolving lock opened, and Dave appeared, pipe in hand,
 a cloud of smoke forming from his nostrils.
 He cracked a wizened smile and asked with a jokingly formal tone:

 He kept fiddling around with his extravagantly bulbous red suit, nervously

 Schneider noticed what Bob was doing and gripped him by the shoulders pads,
 forcing Bob to make eye contact, an uncommon practice which almost everyone
 avoided.

 His words carried strangely ominous undertones.
 He then smiled sharply, as if he had made a joke.
 The look on both their faces told them they knew it wasn't funny at all.
 Bob nodded his acknowledgement and stopped messing with the suit.
 Instead he sat motionless in The Chair, arms resting on its sides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slightly morose look on his face implied he might just as well have
 been shackled to that chair.
 The thought that he had actually done cartwheels when they'd told him he
 had been selected, brought a smile of irony to his face.
 But he still found it almost impossible to just sit tight and wait, so
 he repeated the same technique that had kept him calm throughout all the
 field testing: he started counting everything around him, once again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were forty-nine cooling lines, eighty-four power lines, one hundred
 and sixty-seven signal lines and twenty-three gaseous mixture lines.
 They were supported on two hundred and seventeen metal clips, poles, and
 columns.
 There was a metal grid with nine hundred and seventy-two panels, supporting
 the roof as well as the experiment's infrastructure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was himself, Schneider, fifty-seven technicians, thirteen PhD's, four
 Nobel-prize winners and two soon-to-be.
 All in all, seventy-eight people, or seventy-seven souls.
 Schneider insisted that he had sold his own to the devil.
 He always smiled every time he said that, a sight that always gave the
 impression he wasn't joking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bob gave up on counting the rest; it didn't seem to help this time around.
 This was the Big One, the real try, the make-or-break.
 He gave Schneider a wary look which went largely unnoticed.
 He then made a half-hearted attempt at bad humor, the sort which could
 only lead to nervous laughter at best:

Bob's eyes wandered uncertainly before settling on the observation pane,
 a hundred feet away, and only three feet wide.
 It was large enough for the observers to gape into the Labyrinth, the Intrinsic

\begin_layout Standard
He suddenly deeply wished he could see Lisa behind that pane; but all the
 faces he could glimpse belonged to top brass; emotionless, unwavering,
 rigid.
 People that had no idea what all this was about, having simply been convinced
 that it was more than worth the money that could've bought them a mass-driver
 on the moon, or alternatively, a near-infinite supply of paperclips.
 They just wanted to see if Schneider would deliver the goods; the significance
 of what would be accomplished was totally lost on them.

Bob glimpsed the reflection of him on a cooling bank's chrome surface.
 The crisp touch of ice on his reflected image made him feel warm and comfortabl
e inside the suit.
 His head though was still swimming in the haze from the drug soup he'd
 taken that morning.
 He called out to Schneider who was standing a dozen feet away, running
 last-minute diagnostics on yet another control panel himself:

Bob gave up, and started taking deep breaths with practiced self-discipline,
 forcing himself into a state of serene calmness.
 It was part of a well-rehearsed checklist, and quite contrary to his human,
 innate instinct of fear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He ventured a look at the low-hung ceiling; the mess of cables, pipelines
 and ducts offering a dizzying spectacle.
 He continued his slow, deep, breathing pattern, muttering under his breath.
 When Schneider finished the last of his hands-on checks, he turned his
 attention on the Chair with renewed vigor.
 He noticed Bob had his eyes closed, mumbling inaudibly.

Bob suddenly jerked himself upright, even with all the Suit's bulk.
 His eyes suddenly flared with the same gleam like five years before, when
 he had first entered the project, and laid eyes on the Chair.
 He didn't seem fond of Schneider's idea at all.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kurt shied away, took a few steps backwards.
 He simply nodded, without a smile or a quirky comment.
 He stepped down from the dais on which the Chair had been literally carved
 upon and ran his fingers over a small, insignificant-looking panel.
 Without bells and whistles, a five-minute counter had lit up on a large
 display hanging from the ceiling.
 People around the Labyrinth were slightly caught off-guard, but they quickly
 assumed their predefined posts in front of screens and key equipment.
 They heard Schneider's voice rise above the pervasive electrical humming:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Making history in five minutes, people.
 Hope someone's brought something expensive to drink.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nobody answered.
 As Schneider made his way down the controller's pit, he gazed at the tense
 faces, the rigid bodies.
 He looked up towards the observation window and saw nothing but blant eyes
 ceremoniously fixed on that counter display, approaching zero with a lack
 of effort that did this whole venture little justice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bob simply sat there, mumbling even louder than before, watching the minutes
 on the display flash by in red LEDs, like a hare frozen by headlights.
 He could hear himself now, and he bet Kurt could hear him too, smiling
 uncannily; 'I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven
 and earth, of all things visible and invisible..'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly but ruthlessly the whirring noise of motors and circulation valves
 began to echo in the Labyrinth.
 The lighting became subdued, an array of spot lights illuminating the Chair
 alone, Bob squinting at the harsh white light before his eyes adjusted.
 A flurry of activity could be seen and heard: monitoring equipment had
 been switched on, capacitor banks were filled and ready to discharge unheard
 of amounts of power.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bob had his senses focused entirely on the now, his lips moving as if of
 their own volition.
 His voice sounded like it belonged to someone else: '..begotten, not made,
 consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made..' The only
 thing rising above every other sound was Schneider's crisp voice over the
 PA system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One by one, the various heads of stations answered, some voices more readily
 than others, but none without the unmistakable hint of anxiety.
 No-one seemed certain, no-one believed as much as Schneider, who spoke
 once more with improbable ease:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bob did not answer, so intently focused inwards, disconnecting from the
 surrounding reality.
 His mouth kept wording the Creed: '..in accordance with the Scriptures.
 He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
 He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead..'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Schneider smiled, even if it was only to himself.
 He then announced with a measure of formality:

A few still moments of awkward noise empty of human voice ensued.
 Then a gruff, stentorian voice answered tersely, making the hair on the
 backs of everyone in the Labyrinth rise involuntarily.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some nervous, hesitant smiles could be seen on the faces in front of the
 monitors.
 But Bob wasn't smiling, he was praying, with more fervor than ever before:
 '..who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken
 through the prophets..'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Schneider's face had become a mask frozen in a mix of anticipation and glee.
 Even his eyes seemed out of focus, fixed on a distant point through and
 beyond the Chair.
 The finality of what was about to transpire echoed with overwhelming certainty
 in the crackling air of the Labyrinth.
 Schneider saw the psychosomatic properties of Bob flash white in the panel
 in front of him, everything in tune; Bob was reaching the required mind-state.
 Schneider's voice even though amplified by the PA could not be heard clearly
 above the full-blown sound of activity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A slighlty cumbersome 'thumbs up' was given from the head of the Data monitor,
 but Schneider did not bother to respond in kind.
 Everyone's attention was focused on the Chair, even as Bob peered upwards,
 towards the blinding lamps that bathed him with a light as immaculate as
 fresh snow.
 Schneider started counting:

\begin_layout Standard
Blinding white light seared everyone in the Labyrinth.
 Automatic shutters closed the observation pane, unable to keep the light
 from entering.
 It was as if a small sun had manifested itself in the Chair; no-one could
 stare at it, no-one could see where it emanated from.
 It was impossible to stare directly, hurtful; people cowering in their
 cubicles, averting their eyes from the light; an intense primal fear had
 overwhelmed everyone.
 Everyone except Kurt Schneider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was as if time had stopped right then and there, everyone feeling the
 blood in their veins freeze and their hearts stop.
 Not in awe, not in wonder and amazement, but in simple, primal fear, their
 instincts torn between running like hell and simply hiding away, melding
 with the floor, so as not to be found.
 Some had become one with the floor, others were kneeling low, poised to
 flee away from the light.
 Away from Schneider as well, who was smiling more brightly than ever before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He paced himself to the light, with the determination and surety of a man
 who had prepared for this, who knew what he was looking at and welcomed
 it, instead of fleeing from it; he was not a lesser man.
 He answered to a greater calling, and these lesser humans had helped him,
 driven by lust, greed, and curiousity.
 'How fitting,' he thought to himself, while the standing form of Bob in
 his resplendent red Suit writhing with white and blue-hot flames motioned
 him to stop.
 Schneider complied, and fell on one knee:

\begin_layout Chapter
Yar's Plume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was uncomfortably chilly on the night we saw each other last.
 I remember the methane snow flakes and the carbon ice, the first time around.
 The landscape around the Plume had unusually eerie feeling.
 Even a really long displacement such as the one I was going through now
 could not approximate the feeling.
 The memory somehow made the hair on my back rise.
 A distant, logical and pedantic part of my troubled, aching mind sought
 to inform the other part â the instinctive, impulse-driven part â that
 technically, I had no hair.
 No back for that matter either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I really had to be true and faithful to that stream of thought, I should
 have insisted on telling myself that I had no brain either, no corporeal
 existence of any kind.
 In a sense, it wasnât even me waiting to re-integrate across the other
 end of the Plume.
 It was just a taste of me, or rather an idea of me, a gestatum of awareness:
 a complete mental state, a simulacra of my mind in even the tiniest brane-induc
ed wormholes and superstring matrices that made me who I effectively was.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes I thought it funny that I could be described as a really long
 list of probability equations.
 Some of the math actually had to be invented just to describe me.
 New disciplines were born just because I existed and half-crazed almost
 absurde and fringe scientists became Nobel Prize winners.
 I never understood how it worked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yar had said on our first meeting that I shouldnât worry and fret about
 the process much: I had no soul to displace, so even if he was the devil
 he could do me no harm.
 Iâm still not sure whether or not it was only a joke.
 Canât really tell; the Olon seems wonderfully impervious to serious talk.
 It feels like being able to talk to God, a God with a sense of humor and
 an immodest amount of dislocation from the universe.
 For one thing, the talking makes the process endearing.
 Itâs almost fun.
 But the waiting..
 I sometimes feel it will drive me mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, the terrible waiting.
 The long, sleepless waiting â the nanoseconds that stretch into infinity
 and twist and bend and bog me down every single time.
 Inescapable, terminal boredom when every thought can be counted and analysed,
 repeated, rinsed of logic and sentiment, leaving nothing but a dull echo
 in my mind.
 Was that what everyone felt like across the plume?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I asked Yar about that in numerous occasions; he simply said that it depends
 on the person.
 It seems that even if I am the only one in thirty-two billion human souls
 that can confer with Yar across the Plume, Iâm not especially suited to
 the task.
 Sometimes I wish I wasnât at all, other times I wish I could just turn
 the switch and displace as if it was as normal as breathing.
 Sometimes I wish I could just steer away from the Plume, get lost somewhere
 where I could not be found, somewhere beyond the infinite I have so casually
 embraced.
 I wish I could roam free, beyond the Plume's imaginary walls; take a sabbatical.
 Go on vacation.
 Lose myself in the greater neighborhood of the cosmos.
 But I couldn't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yar had cautiously advised against that.
 It was probably because he believed I couldnât do that, and as with pretty
 much anything, he was right.
 I couldn't, the smart boys and girls in the lab coats couldn't, the massive
 computational grids couldn't.
 The technical term the collective of Nobel prize winners, multiple patent
 holders and ground-breaking scientific prodigies had come up with was âdouble
 glazingâ.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can look, but you cannot touch.
 That space in between, that space beyond the abnormal space of the Plume
 that I could feel or 'see', wasn't even space they said.
 It was a medium, a conveyor, but not like the Plume.
 It was a kind of appropriately demure punishment for amounting to little
 more than a flee in the larger scale of cosmic evolution, to ride on the
 same subway across the stars, everyday, to the same place, talk to the
 same person.
 What a job though.
 More than that: what a ride, to ride the plume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was long, and arduous, and for the better part boring.
 In essence, a real job.
 I played out a lot of fantasies involving myself.
 It was an advice Yar had given me and had paid off handsomely, saved some
 of my sanity.
 It was an inherent property of the plume: the lab monkeys had gone apeshit
 with all the data they were getting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I simply had to imagine it, merely think about something solid and irrefutably
 real, and it would make sense and appear.
 I could grow limbs, swim in oceans of lava, fly like a unicorn across the
 rainbow.
 There were no bars or limits: in the realm of transluminar wave-particle
 inference entity projection, I was more than king; I was God.
 It was my domain.
 And without all the moments I had wished I was dead, I could not have cherished
 the moments when I felt myself oscillate in tune with the universe, or
 at least what little of it I could feel and see through the Plume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outside, in the real world, I was the envied treasure of the human species,
 the sole human being capable of communicating with a higher intellect across
 the vast distances of the stars, bringing back science, lore, truth, and
 answers.
 They only cared about the answers, though.
 They rarely paused to stop questions.
 At least not once they had room temperature fusion, teleportation, cellular
 rejuvenation and a whole new bag of tricks.
 There was a singularity effect; the world would never have been ready for
 such big news.
 Small wars were fought between ancient mindsets and cutting-edge weapons.
 I saw none of that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They told me we had won, and effectively ended any serious threats to our
 so-called great and luminous Union.
 The lab monkeys got drunk that day, which was a first in oh, so many years.
 It looked like the people on Earth were getting used to all the fancy technolog
ies and science leaps everyday.
 It was only so much they could absorb, so little time to care.
 It didnât really matter to me what the people thought: they told me stories
 about people thinking I was a demon, that I was the devil incarnate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That I had made up everything Yar had freely taught me.
 That I was some sort of cunning alien, that I was a cyborg or a machine.
 People do that all the time I guess, trying to put into words and familiar
 circumstances that which is completely new and unexplainable, that which
 language fails to capture wholly.
 No-one could understand the Plume.
 Not me, and I rode the damn thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hotshots believed me though.
 At first, they thought I was just another mental patient with some weird
 brain issues.
 An idiot savant yet to be included in the literature.
 Then someone dug a little deeper, and found out I couldn't simply know
 the things I scrawled everywhere when I went into catalepsis.
 And then they called in the real money pushers, and they brought their
 government friends along.
 And they set up a labyrinth of machines and experimental arrays.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have hazy memory nowdays, more hazy than I'd like to, but I some things
 come to as clear as sunstreaks through a clowd.
 A general had asked me, while I still retained the capability, `Do you
 know we've put more resources into you than in all of recorded history?'.
 I think I grinned and said something eloquent like `Who's the crazy person
 now, motherfucker?'.
 Perhaps I still thought there was someway out of there, that I could go
 back to the asylum once they were through with me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They knew I was for real.
 So when they fired up the test, they couldnât understand the details, and
 couldn't exactly comprehend or describe the mechanism, but they knew that
 in those few seconds, my mind had been displaced for an unknown distance,
 and when it had arrived, it was a completely different kind of monster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new breed of devil, thatâs what I had become.
 Too valuable to throw away, too dangerous to let be.
 The wealth of data coming in through my cortex was the answer to all of
 their prayers, and reason I started to believe in God.
 To believe in me.
 No-one shutdown the test ever since.
 No-one dared lose the connection to the most precious source of knowledge
 in humankind's existence.
 They brought more technicians, more engineers, more scientists.
 I think I tried to kill myself once.
 That was something they didn't want.
 They made some more permanent arrangements, and they always let the lights
 on.
 I didn't know then I would never again see the sun with my own eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they cared for me.
 Their needles, pumps and monitors cared.
 Perfectly aligned vital signs.
 All sorts of antibiotics and cell treatments to keep me healthy.
 Keep the vessel intact, keep me going.
 But no-one dared touch my mind.
 No-one dared to let me out of my cage.
 And so I screamed, and cried, and went insane.
 But when I had no other life in me, I slept.
 When I slept, I displaced: I spent the time leading all the sorts of lives
 I wish I had the opportunity to live.
 And then I talked with Yar.
 The rough bits, the ones I couldnât really understand, he just put them
 along inside my mind in what he called âlunch boxesâ.
 The nice bits, those we would talk about over and over and reminisce afterwards
 and recall with sharp lucidity and infectuous desire, those were why I
 still did what I did, why I displaced.
 And that was why they kept me alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasnât what I brought back with me for the doctors to divulge to the
 world what made me displace; I couldnât care less for mankind's single-minded
 approach to progress.
 My real world, my true life, the one I did not imagine but the one I saw
 and touched, even through a copy of mine, even spread across a thousand
 different selves, was still mine; and I would cherish it and hold it fast
 against the echoes of my splintered soul even after I had found a way to
 blow my brains back in the lab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I laughed, but no-one laughed along with me.
 It was like those embarassing moments when you think everybody likes you,
 and then you say something stupid or crude and they're staring blank-eyed,
 scoffing, unapproving eyes all over you.
 Displeased.
 Disappointed.
 Some said that perhaps they were going too far, others said there was noplace
 far enough after me.
 Maybe that's true too.
 What's real, what's real in the Plume, and what's real in my head cannot
 be unmade anymore.
 It's now taken on a substance of its own.
 Sometimes I think they know I'm not human now.
 Well, perhaps I still am, but only when I'm around Yar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last time I displaced, I had the faintest idea of a chill running down
 my spine.
 I think I saw snow falling lazily against a frozen lake, and Yarâs shadowy
 outline doing figures on the ice like a kid on New Yearâs day.
 I heard him then, and could see his smile even if he didnât have a face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
âWhat took you so long? Grab a pair of skates.
 This is gonna be real fun!â
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I put on a pair of skates, and jumped on the ice.
 As I started to pick up speed slowly, I could see Yar's lithe sleek form
 coming towards me with the grace of a ballerina and the joy shining upon
 his face like pure sunshine:

Yar then grinned and stopped the skates.
 The backdrop of the icy lake in the night flipped a page, literally, and
 turned into a large park in autumn.
 Dogs barking in the distance, people jogging, having strolls and picknicks.
 Children's voices could be heard.
 It was an entirely human picture, something swept out of my own mind with
 painstaking detail and vivid feeling.
 It felt, and was, as right and real.
 Yar sounded weird, a bit worried:

Well, that's what I've been trying to talk to you about.
 Maybe, at some point, we should have built up more of a rapprochement.
 Maybe, I should have been more candid, know what I mean?

And then I turned to look at the ducks flying towards the south, and as
 my head swirled this way and that, I could not tell what my name was.

It's Ray.
 Ray Barry.
 There's no point going on about this forever, so I'll just be frank with
 you, now that there's little else to do.
 You were institutionalized in 2019.
 In 2027 your family gave consent for an experimental treatment based on
 chemically induced coma and virtual synaptic environments.
 I'm Dr.
 Vishnaputna Ariamsendrakhar, and I'm deeply sorry to inform you that the
 program's funding has been cut.
 You are going to wake up to the real world soon, Ray.
 And frankly, I don't know what you'll make of it, or all this that you
 have been dreaming.
 Part of which I have tried to influence.
 Frankly though Ray, we weren't making much of a progress.

I tried to speak, but no words came out of my mouth.
 I then turned the scenery into the frozen lake I had seen before, and I
 put on my skates.
 Yar, or the doctor, had spoken the truth.
 I knew that, Yar always told the truth.
 As I paced myself around the lake, I kept talking, and he kept answering:

Well to put it plainly, yes.
 We've had some VR sessions while in the coma: That was members of my team
 taking interviews and generally trying to work things out in your head,
 with your help.
 It was supposed to revolutionalise psychiatric analysis and treatment of
 mental patients.
 Sadly it fell a bit short.

Yes, Ray.
 We actually found out the hard way it was pretty impossible to not let
 you imagine things.
 All in all, the project was a failure but we gained some remarkable insights
 into the human psyche.
 Things we could only, literally, dream of.
