{\footnotesize Foreword from the author}
\par\end{center}{\footnotesize \par}

\begin{flushleft}
{\footnotesize I couldn't really find a working subtitle for this
first book in what's to become a series. Arguably, it's not a book
per se (meaning not a full length novel), but a book it is still.}
\par\end{flushleft}{\footnotesize \par}

\begin{flushleft}
{\footnotesize ``Party of Five'' starts off with this book here,
and I envision it as a series of novellas that I want to keep writing,
evolving the characters and the world as I go. I could do that it
in a full length novel, but it's much easier for me to write smaller,
self-contained adventures that are linked together through the same
characters, being fresh and different each time.}
\par\end{flushleft}{\footnotesize \par}

\begin{flushleft}
{\footnotesize Plus, I think a series of novellas can reach an audience
faster and it easier and more practical (hopefully more fun) to read
for most people. It is also my opinion that the novella as a genre,
needs some more love from authors and readers alike.}
\par\end{flushleft}{\footnotesize \par}

\begin{flushleft}
{\footnotesize I dearly hope you'll come to like the characters enough
to wait for the next novella in the series.}

\begin{quotation}
``I've never really understood all those planet-bound folk that look
at the night sky all starry-eyed and gaze at it with a superbly idiotic
grin and lose their grip on reality, making up all sorts of ideas
about what space is like. I'll say this just once, hopefully some
of you cadets are dead drunk not to notice the mistake you just made;
space is boring, unforgiving, empty and a lot bigger than it looks
like. A real lot.''

-- Rear Admiral Stephen Zondmeier VII, Human League fleet academy
welcoming speech
\end{quotation}
Ned was leaning against the upper deck railing, gazing at the milky
blue sheen of a swarm of stars that showered the ship with a fuzzy,
moon-like glow. For the last few days, ever since they'd sailed into
the stars, a strange smile seemed to occupy his face for most of his
waking time, while in his sleep all he could see was the glitter of
stars, and the image of his father waving at him encouragingly to
move on into a beautiful unknown.

The ship moved in dead silence; one could only surmise it was really
moving at all because of the twinkle of the stars as their light bounced
off the metal ramrod in its prow. Winceham was snoring heavily nearby,
occupying a simple hay bed he'd brought from below deck, while Parcifal
kept a mindful, worried eye at Lernea's handling of the ship, who
looked utterly and totally bored to death. Theo and Bo were shooting
fireworks far off astern and seemed unequivocally happy.

``It's wonderful, isn't it?'' said Ned to no-one in particular,
and for a rather awkward amount of time, noone bothered to reply.
At length, Parcifal turned her head and looked at him morosely, her
hands folded behind her head as if surrendering to the uneventful,
humdrum quagmire that she felt their journey was.

``What, exactly, do you find wonderful?'' she said with a monotone
voice. Ned pointed to the vastness of space surrounding them and replied
in earnest:

``All this.''

``This,'' she said and nodded to a random patch of blackness, ``is
a void. A nothingness. I'm nearly spent by boredom.''

``Oh, you're just lacking that flint to spark the imagination within
you. I've written down a song about it. Dozens actually.''

``Please, not another one,'' said Parcifal with a worried, sickly
frown and a thrust-out open palm. Ned was truly puzzled, and it showed
both in his voice and the sudden jerk of his neck.

``Why not?''

``I'm not in the mood. Gracious Skrala, not now, not ever,'' said
Parcifal and failing to find the north in a place where it meant absolutely
nothing, she sighed and made the warding gesture of Skrala.

``Mood is a thing for cattle, and love-making,'' a grumby, muffled
voice said without warning.

It was Winceham, half-asleep yet instantly aware of what was being
said, his rogueish instincts always at the ready. Lernea's hard, solemn
face changed abruptly to that of a radiant, noble lady such as her
lineage would demand of her.

She said, or rather announced with a beaming voice:

``Mr. Winceham, I think that now, as they saying goes, she's all
yours.''

``I wouldn't want to intrude on your persons miladies. I think she's
rather tall, too young and inexperienced for me taste, not to mention
somewhat lank on the waist,'' replied Winceham, with his face still
buried in the soft cloth mattress filled with hay. Parcifal looked
at the short halfuin with a perplexed frown, before she came to realise
he was referring to her; her boot shortly thereafter connected with
the halfuin's behinds, shoving him off the cot and onto the hard deck.

``My waist is fine by all accounts, thank you,'' said Parcifal looking
mildly annoyed. Winceham picked himself up sporting a grin of mischief
and no ill feelings, while Ned added, from an entirely different train
of thought:

``Are you saying, my singing is bad? Because, if I recall correctly,
it worked like magic with the pirates and the ape-men.''

``Which is to say,'' interjected Lernea, strolling around the deck
stretching her back, ``it's fit for animals and scum.''

There was no-one at the helm, a matter which was soon made entirely
apparent to everyone as the ship began to slowly list to port. Just
as Parcifal walked over to grab the helm, a look of annoyance on her
face, she saw Bo flying accross the air as if falling slowly sideways,
his fluffy ears shooting in strange directions, firm and upright as
if frozen by an amazing sense of danger. Theo followed close behind,
smiling as broadly as a child left to its devices alongside a cookie
jar. Parcifal stood baffled, while Theo grabbed the helm as he flew
past it, turned the ship back on its proper course and twisted his
body to settle his feet on the ground with the grace of a dancer.

``And, it seems now I can fly!'' he said proudly, while Bo could
be seen a few feet away, happily munching on an oversized leek with
awe-inspiring veracity.

Ned exclaimed on cue:

``It's space! It's so grandiose, so alluring. Anything is possible,
see?'' he said and pointed at a levitating Theo with a gleaming smile.
Winceham and the Teletha sisters did not seem to share in the enthusiasm.

``That's what you've been saying for the past two weeks,'' said
Lernea and let herself slump to the cot with a weary sigh. Parcifal
added with some real concern:

``Not to mention that all we're navigating blind, based on that scum's
word alone.''

``He'd be a fool to try and fool us. We need to reach some kind of
port, at some point. That's for sure. Food and water is aplenty though,
no worries there,'' said Winceham scratching his head.

``Well, what if we're walking into a trap?'' asked Parcifal, shaking
her head, looking agitated.

``That would be sailing into a trap,'' corrected Lernea from her
cot, without bothering to take her arm off her shut eyes. Theo said
with confidence, even as he kept the ship on course with little effort:

``I think everything's as it should be. Bo isn't the least bit nervous,''
he said and toyed with the bunny's ears, Bo wriggling with pleasure
on Theo's shoulder.

``Bo is a bunny, Theo,'' said Parcifal with a voice that teetered
on the brink of a shrill. Theo wasn't taken aback and insisted:

``Well, I trust his instincts. You'll see.''

``Believe me, I'm dying to,'' said Parcifal, brandishing her lack
of humor for everyone to see, as if it were Encelados, her trusted
blade.

``Harsh words in haste can oft be bad in taste,'' said Winceham
in a sing-along voice as he produced his smoking pipe and pouch from
a vest pocket.

``I thought Ned was the poet,'' said Lernea with a puzzled voice
and a childish frown. Ned was sincere in what he thought was an apology:

``I hate to disappoint, but I do not do free verse.''

``Well, Svarna be my guide, there's hope for our ears yet,'' replied
Parcifal in an utterly disenchanted manner. Ned was beginning to realise
his talents were being judged too harshly, all too unfairly.

``You keep making these remarks about my singing.''

``I thought you'd never notice. Frankly, I'd prefer you kept these
performances to yourself,'' said Parcifal and sat down on the deck,
legs crossed.

``That's what I do, Parcifal. I perform,'' said Ned. It was obvious
he was moreso hurt than offended. Parcifal drove home what sonuded
like an insult:

``Well, it would be more beneficial if you tried your hand at something
else. A man without a sword is like a cup riddled with holes: useless.''

Winceham lit his pipe, drew heavily and added as smoke left his nose
and mouth freely:

``And dry as hell to boot. Cut the lad some slack, milady; he's more
than proved his usefulness when that monster had us at his maw.''

``You're being unfair, sister. You stood there frozen, incapacitated,
just like the rest of us. Except Ned,'' said Lernea and pointed a
blind finger at Theo, missing Ned wildly. Parcifal unsheathed Encelados
and dutifully began to check the blade in detail, from all angles.
It looked sharp as ever in the starlight.

``I would still think that was a freak occurrence. It has never happened
to me before,'' she said, seemingly without giving the incident much
thought.

``Well, there's a first time for everything, milady. Maybe you're
too young to know better.,'' said Winceham and looked away, drawing
on his pipe, trying to look innocent, yet a grin and a pout full of
mischief adorned his face. Parcifal was quick to answer:

``Is that another one of your sexual innuendos? Mother always said
men are immature. I had no idea she meant old people as well.''

``I'm not that old mind you. I don't usually brag about it, but I
could keep a lady up all night,'' said Winceham and secretly wished
he could remember the last time that had happened.

``It must be the snoring,'' Lernea said matter-of-factly, and Parcifal
grinned without a word, her sister aptly filling in for her.

``There!'' shouted Ned suddenly and pointed a finger, his excitement
threatening to tear his face apart. Everyone turned thier heads as
if silently obeying an order. A moment or so passed before Parcifal
asked with a somewhat surreptitious, wary look, her hand drawn to
Encelados' hilt on its own:

``Where, exactly?''

``Don't you see it?'' cried Ned as he rushed to the ship's bow like
a five-year old waiting for ice cream to appear out of thin air. Winceham
furrowed his brow and toyed with his beard for a moment before adding:

``What are we looking for, lad?''

``That star! See how its light trembles? How it fades in and out?
That's it! That must be Tallyflop!'' shouted Ned without taking his
eyes off the trembling, pointy source of light. Bo's eyes lit up like
a blowing furnace all of a sudden and he made sure he had Theo's full
attention, jumping up and down around the ship's steering wheel. The
elf knew the bunny meant business so he brought the ship's bow to
bear dead on where Bo pointed with his whole body, much more like
a hunting dog than an innocent-looking herbivore would.

Lernea spared a moment or so to take a look as well, barely standing
straight up from the cot, as if peering over an invisible perch.

``All I see is a twinkling star,'' she said drowsily and fell on
the cot again like she half-expected to be roused for school too soon
for comfort.

``It could be a beacon,'' said Winceham stroking his beard thoughtfully.

``Exactly!'' shouted Ned, while Theo exclaimed:

``Bo sure looks excited!''

Parcifal looked at the star, growing subtly larger with every passing
moment. Then she stared at the elf and the bunny for a moment or so,
her look full of apprehension. She said to Theo:

``Whenever those eyes flame up...Nothing good ever happens.''

Theo would have none of that. He shook a hand dismissively and firmly
said, his eyes fixed on the twinkling star up ahead:

``Preposterous. Utterly unfounded. Pessimistic superstitious misconceptions.
Bo's eyes flaming up and our predicaments have absolutely no correlation,
on a scientific or thaumaturgic basis whatsoever.''

Wnceham turned and looked at Theo rather confounded, yet approving
of his answer. He nodded and said:

``Well said, lad.''

Winceham smiled at Theo, who in turn bowed lightly towards the halfuin.
The brief moment of well-earned flattery made Parcifall roll her eyes
and sigh. Winceham, always prowling about to boost his ego in many
small ways that to him added up to enormous amounts, was about to
make a sly, wry comment on the virtuous of proper language and etiquette,
the grin on his face a sure sign he was going to enjoy it no matter
what Parcifal's reaction was.

To his surprise though, the only words that came out of his mouth
when his gaze ventured upwards before it came down again, had nothing
to do with proper language and much less, etiquette:

``Blasted gracious all-mighty hairy cactus of your mother's tit!''

Parcifal spent a moment in a deep frown, trying to fit the words into
categories. Her finger was already raised in a warning when she looked
at Winceham with a seething glare and shouted:

``Recant, sirrah! I know an insult even if I don't understand it!''

``Look!'' cried Ned as he ran towards the bridgehead, his head stuck
upwards as if he was training for a sword-eating contest.

Parcifal only looked upwards when she saw both Theo and Bo look up
as well, their faces and fur respectively strangely illuminated, standing
still like under a spell. Her hand insticitvely went for Encelados'
once more but half-way it froze as well: the sight in front of her
eyes had captivated her very soul, and everyone else as well, it seemed.

They were sailing under a majestic field of starlight, rivulets of
stardust and beams of light wafting down from above, where the giant
gnarly branches of an old, wizened tree dominated the starscape. Where
before there had been nothing, now they were suddenly sailing on like
a butterfly around an oak, gracefully passing by clusters of huge
green leaves, easily the size of a small village, emanating a faint
greenish glow, while in the distance around them, more and more leaves
and branches appeared, like someone was clearing up a fog-stained
window with the back of his hand.

Swaths of light and soft shadows crept over them at an easy pace as
the ship continued on its course, as if they were sailing under a
soft, thin, silken coloured bedding the likes of which every child
would only ever hope to dream about. It was as if a tunnel of light
and shadow was put on top of a playful, shining net that tossed and
writhed about in a beautiful dance of its own making.

``What is this place?'' wondered Ned, a feeling of awe coming over
him like a wet breeze would, every inch of his body feeling it little
by little.

``It certainly looks like a tree,'' said Winceham, unable to peel
his eyes away from a sight that now enveloped the whole of the ship.

``By Svarna, it's the most beautiful thing I've seen outside the
Holy Mountain,'' said Parcifal with a stupefied grin on her face,
all her worries and fears instantly gone, her armor shining like a
child's smile.

``See? I told you Bo had a good reason for being excited. Isn't that
right Bo?'' said Theo gleefully as he kept the ship steadily trained
between a pair of branches that seemed to lead them on like the walls
of corridor.

Then again, out of nowhere, a ship the shape of a bumblebee and easily
twice the size of the ``Mary Watchamacallit'' appeared at her prow;
ridden with holes and clumsy patches of copper plating and shoddy,
badly trimmed sails, it looked like a flying collection of scrap.
A pair of large harpoons were trained on them already though, seemingly
manned by pairs of short, ugly, mischievous-looking green little things
wearing ridiculously oversized goggles.

``It's an ambush!'' cried Parcifal and unsheathed Encelados, warily
checking all around her, as if she half-expected more invisible threats
to materialise.

``It certainly looks like an ambush,'' said Winceham not knowing
whether he should ready his stiletto or try how well swimming applies
to space. Theo remained silent, exchanging some oddly thoughtful looks
with Bo, even if that meant mainly staring at the rabbit's twitching
nose. The flaming eyes had died down.

``It's fairly normal, I think,'' said Theo, while Ned commented
with a worrisome, yet controlled voice:

``Which is, the gargantuan tree floating in space or being ambushed?''

Theo gave Ned a simple shrug, failing to see an answer was not expected
of him. A deafening, snarling sound made everyone's face twitch and
contort unpleasantly as it was amplified needlessly through some sort
of speaker device:

``Oy! This is Mr. Snog, Cappn' of the 'Mary Celestial'. We'll be
towing you into the harbor. Do not, I repeat, do not attempt to scuttle
the ship or break away; we've got hooks and arrows and all sorts o'
thingamajigs to take care o' runaways. I guarantee I'll personally
feed ya to the gimps.''

A cough, a loud buzz and a shrieking noise were heard before the voice
died down. The little green creatures wearing the goggles seemed to
be enjoying this immensely, judging from the way they giggled and
toyed with the oversized harpoon launchers, crude-looking contraptions
but menacing nonetheless.

``What did he say? Towing us in?'' Ned asked Winceham who nodded
with a frown. Parcifal still held Encelados at a defensive stance.

``What for?'' she asked, while Theo again offered another shrug
of almost complete indifference, seemingly too preoccupied with steering
the ship.

``I'm up! I'm up! No need to yell!'' said Lernea who had jumped
out of bed, her hair in a ruffle, rubbing her eyes and judging from
her wild-eyed look, trying to understand why there was a large oak
tree yelling at her in space.
