\begin_layout Chapter*
Chapter One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few weary-looking men were gathered around a standard-issue hololith table,
 badly scratched and flickering wildly, its blue-hued column of light shooting
 up almost to the ceiling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the men wore grim expressions on their faces the signs of battle
 fatigue and intermittent sleep etched in the hollow looks they exchanged
 silently.
 Metallic echoes reverberated all around them, as if the walls were about
 to burst open and fill the small recreation hall with the cold, harsh void
 outside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, nobody seemed to be bothered; however fragile they looked at first
 glance, their rock-solid attention was aimed at two pairs of hands dancing
 through the holographic projection, picking up tiny icons, shuffling through
 virtual inventories and linking up unit pieces.
 It was a peculiar sort of dance; sometimes rough and sometimes graceful.
 But it was in a constant flow; the two players of quadrachi never paused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One pair of hands looked unmistakably feminine, while the other pair of
 hands looked scaled, leathery, and claw-like.
 One claw-like hand made a gesture and the holographic projection froze
 in place.
 A few counters showed up and a timer appeared and started counting backwards.
 The woman smiled thinly, peered through the projection straight into the
 eyes of her opponent:

Han's quite large nostrils flared up and he made a snorting sound.
 He did not smile back and started to scratch at the hololith table, right
 at the spot were most of the surface had already been mostly eaten away
 - almost down to the optronics inside.
 The timer silently kept edging closer to zero, while the Han's labored
 breathing became more pronounced.
 Metallic creaks and reverberations could still be heard, but now more than
 ever noone seemed to even notice them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Han had been focusing on a particular quadrant of the projection when he
 said with a slight grin, revealing a quite lethal set of serrated teeth:

Aren't you enjoying this Major Ciarandor? I thought this was a pleasurable
 experience for humans,

Only when playing against a Keplerian, Han.
 The blood-bet makes it so much more interesting,

 Major Ciarandor replied with an almost gleeful look and an imperceptibly
 wily smile.

There's no meaning in loss without pain, Major.

It's what makes us learn from our mistakes, Han.
 Will you forfeit while the timer's ticking? Or shall we play?

 said Han suddenly laughing wildly with bulging eyes, fully revealing both
 sets of teeth in a jaw designed for killing.
