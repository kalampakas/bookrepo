\chapter*{Introduction}

Since the dawn of humanity's tool-wielding days, man has arguably
made a lot of progress: we now have things that daily shape our lives
in totally unpredictable and curious ways. Like the internet, cheap
airplane tickets, nuclear plants, celebrities, and a whole multidimensional
array of advances that create a sense of awesome power and an assured
future for the whole of planet Earth.

I hate to break it to you, but if you still haven't heard, the world
as we know it will end on December 21, 2012. The experts confirm it,
the evidence is overwhelming, and very important personalities from
around the world (including - but not limited to - Mel Gibson and
Dan Aykroyd for example) are already admitting what the rest of humanity
turns a deaf ear to: the 2011 Christmas, will be everyone's Last Christmas
on Earth.

Surely, it's kind of difficult to imagine a world without Christmas:
even the Chinese have grudgingly admitted that it's fun (and good
for business). But the truth of the matter is that even if the world
doesn't go up in flames in 2012, and there's still life to be found
on the planet, the world-shattering events that are bound to happen,
will change everything forever. Including Christmas.

You may refer to the appropriate sections in this guide to see the
insurmountable evidence that has accrued over these last few years
by scientists, academics, journalists, actors and all sorts of experts
and activists. It's real; it will happen. But do not despair, because
at least you have the opportunity to make the most out of what little
time is left for everyone.

And what better way to do it, than making these last Christmas on
Earth, the best Christmas of your life? What better way to throw your
fist up in the air and defy the universe and fate itself by boldly
stating that you don't care if the world is turned into a molten ball
of lava. That it doesn't really matter if it's turned into a pock-marked
shadow of its former self. That even if the oceans boil away or cover
the entire surface of the planet, even if Earth is split in half like
an egg, if aliens invade and lay waste to everything, even Alaska,
you would have remained eternally young, like the stuff the stars
made of, making this Christmas reason enough for the cosmos to shed
a tiny tear for our coming annihilation.

This guide, is not a survival guide per se: the chances of survival
from the coming annihilation are rather slim, if not just a dream.
And though our bodies will be broken, our spirits will remain true,
defiant: We should celebrate like never before, as these will be our
last Christmas. And this guide will help you spread the truth and
glory of the last, best Christmas on Earth, releasing you in the process
from all the trouble of living in an uncertain world.

Once you firmly subscribe to the ideas and notions presented in this
guide, it is guaranteed you'll have the time of your lives and these
holidays will be a thing to remember for the rest of your lives.

Throughout the various sections, there will be points assigned to
the various activities and actions you should perform to make these
Christmas truly unique (apart from being your last, of course). You
should check up with the scoreboard at the end of the book once the
holiday season is over to find out whether or not your Christmas experience
was truly monumental.

Remember:

These will be your last Christmas on Earth. Make them count.


\chapter{It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine}

One might get the feeling that the annihilation of the world is a
bad thing. Some might say that `bad' is an understatement. But I ask
you this: how many worlds, in how many galaxies have been annihilated,
only to be reborn, the few lucky survivors spurred on to achieve greatness,
and ensure the survival of their species, their civilization: According
to Drake's revised equation, probably millions. Complete world annihilation
is a fact, but it's only as natural as a ants: You can easily burn
an anthill to the ground, but some of the ants will getaway, with
seed on their backs. They'll build again.

This is the most appropriate mindset when dealing with the knowledge
of the world's demise: it's not that big of a deal. It's something
that happens every day. Actually, it happens every minute: a recent
NASA report concluded that every minute, approximately 92.1 million
planets are consumed by supernovas, 123.2 million are obliterated
by asteroid impacts, 78.4 million torn apart by gravitic forces, 23.1
million self-destruct, and roughly 10 million planets just vanish
out of orbit.

In contrast, 312.3 million planets are born every minute, hence the
well-documented expanding nature of the universe (there may be small
discrepancies in the numbers but these are just statistical figures,
not the complete data set, so do not be alarmed if the math doesn't
check out - believe me, the universe is growing despite all the planets
being destroyed).

The main idea behind all this is that you should live the rest of
your lives in fear. You should come to grips with the idea that you
were going to die anyway in a few decades. This development only makes
it happen sooner. Once you accept that fact, a whole new world of
possibilities to make the most out of this Christmas opens up.

To do that, you need to understand how and why the end of the world
is going to happen on December 21, 2012. You also need to understand
why there's no public acknowledgement of the fact from government
and scientific circles. You need to understand that there's no going
around it, it will happen one way or another, it can't be avoided,
stopped, or delayed, and that even if you do survive (the chances
are slightly better if you're living in China but not by much) these
will be indeed your last Christmas.

Read on, and remember:

It's going to happen. It can't be avoided. These are your last Christmas.
You can only make them count.


\section{What the fuss is all about}

The Maya were a highly advanced mesoamerican civilization. They had
very advanced knowledge of astronomy, mathematics and medicine, and
they are the only known civilization to have a fully developed written
language.

As recent archaelogical evidence and historical research suggests,
the Maya were most probably descendants of the Anunnaki, the ancient
God-like beings who have time and again seeded humanity with apocryphal
knowledge, some of which remains hidden to this day. Though the exact
links between Atlantis, the Annunaki, the Sumerians, and the Mayans
is not easy to trace, there is ample enough evidence to support the
idea that in fact Mayans were the caretakers of the alien Anunnaki's
most unfathomable secrets. Mainly, the exact date of the destruction
of the Earth.

Tha Maya have clearly noted down that date in their calendar, which
literally ends with December 21, 2012. Of course they hadn't noted
down that particular date with a big red circle. But through intense
analysis, cross-references and some pretty heavy math, archaeologists
have transcribed the Mayan calendar into Gregorian dates.

Using state-of-the-art computers from the NSA, who had flagged the
excavations back in the early 1980s as of utmost importance to national
security (some even presume the upheaval in Latin American countries,
like Nicaragua, or the war on drugs in Colombia and Mexico were most
probably cover operations for other, larger NSA schemes to secure
artifacts and working Mayan computers), scientists at various well-respected
academic institutions who prefer to remain anonymous for obvious reasons,
are very definite that the date is set in stone, both literally and
figuratively speaking.

Certain reactionists, people who place more value in belief rather
than concrete evidence, shout their opposition to the idea that an
ancient civilization like the Maya could actually have predicted the
end of the world, while even today with all the computing power available,
a weather forecast is indeed a matter mostly left to chance. These
people who are quick to discard the truth about the Mayan revelation
are either afraid to even consider the horrifying prospect of utter
annihilation, or have further agendas that should be taken into consideration
(see section 1.2).

Others try to subtly alter the meaning behind this fascinating though
ominous discovery: some malinformed skeptics point out that the last
date in the Mayan calendar, is nothing but the last day in a cycle,
an age or a period.

That is a pretty thought, but again hard evidence quickly dissolves
any illusions that this assumption might hold true: Why would a Mayan
who knows when to plant his crops, and when to wait for the changing
of the weather, knowing that these things happen time and time again,
mark any of it down? Were the inscriptions a chance artifact? Why
if it was common knowledge at the time bury such evidence under heaps
of dirt, stone, and walls, deep into the most difficult to reach parts
of the Mexican jungle? This kind of wishful thinking only detracts
from the really valid and useful questions:

How did the Maya come across that very sensible information? Why did
they note it down in fragile clay platters instead of carving it on
the Earth, like the Incas did in their Nazca fields? Why wasn't there
a whole monument dedicated to the End of Days, like the Pyramids? 

We may never know. Some of it, we will never have the time to find
out. But certainly the Mayas weren't speaking for themselves: it all
came from a higher form of intelligence, a space-faring civilization
with powers yet impossible to grasp: The Annunaki.

Why put trust in these aliens whom we've never seen before? Why should
we listen to these sirens of danger? Because they've warned us time
and again (the flaming bush? Noah's ark? there's ample evidence even
in the Bible itself, not to mention the Dead Sea Scrolls).

Through means unimaginable to us even at this advantaged day and age,
the Anunnaki have calculated a catastrophic event is to occur on December
21, 2012. There are various scenarios that might bring this end about,
ranging from a rogue planet reorbiting the Sun after hundreds of thousands
of years to supervolcanoes. There's nothing really apocryphal, magical,
or supernatural about all that. It's perfectly good, solid, though
far-advanced computer technology that simply permits civilizations
like the Annunaki to make accurate predictions on a galactic scale.

See section 1.3 for a more detailed explanation and the undeniable
proof concerning the Mayan calendar and the date the Mayas have preserved
from their ancient past: the date the world end.

Remember:

These are your last Christmas. Now you know why the world is going
to end. It's not too late to make this Christmas the best you'll ever
have.


\section{Why we're not being told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth}

At a first glance, there is no large cover-up; no disinformation campaign,
no large media war to subdue the masses into believing the world is
perfectly safe. And that's the trick.

We, as a human species, have inherited the survival instinct of our
predatory ancestors. It is therefore only a natural instinct to disregard
the signs, the omens, the proof. Therefore, even if the people that
already know what's going down (the NSA, the Echelon people, the Dead
Sea Scrolls Society, the shadow government located at the Pitcairn
Islands), don't need to do anything. Anything at all.

Just by ignoring the facts and simply laughing off what's by now a
known matter among certain expert academic circles and grass-roots
non-government organizations, they've achieved their goal: to simply
enhance the people's knee-jerk reaction, which is to completely deny
even the merest possibility that the world is going to end, on December
21, 2012.

But ask yourselves, why deny the inevitable? What do they hope to
gain, since it will be plain for all to see that our time on Earth,
as we know it, is running hopelessly out?

Some would be quick to point out, that as in the case of the faked
moon landings, the creation of the Soviet Union and the withholding
of teleportation and nuclear fusion technology, their purpose is control
of the masses. That they believe a wide-spread panic would ensue when
official news of the end of the world was announced.

Ask yourself? Would that be the case? Would people start running around
in mindless frenzy, digging caves, going up mountains and building
nuclear fallout shelters? Are we just primals, still in fear of fire,
the thunder and the snow? Do we still believe we are nothing but a
blimp in history, a tiny cosmological error to be wiped at a mere
fancy of the cosmos?

Ask yourself, are we not men (and women)?

It's only a matter of logistics. If people knew the world was about
to end, they'd largely reorganize their priorities: Work would become
unimportant: people would have walks, dinner with friends, play and
enjoy their last rays of sun.

And that would inevitably be bad for the economy, an overly mismanaged,
debt-ridden economy that creates inordinate amounts of immaterial
wealth: money on paper. Do you seriously believe all that money is
anything other than a means to repress people, make them fearful of
the future and subdue them into looking the other way, even while
the space elevator to Mars is in its last stages of construction.

That's what they're doing right behind everyone's back: trying to
avoid the inevitable. And they don't want anyone to know because then,
everybody would like a seat on that space elevator.

You don't really have to worry about all that though: their plan is
pretty much doomed to failure. It's not just the interpretation of
the mayans, as well as the most recent proof on Nubiru, the asteroid
shower, the alien invasion fleet and the magmatropic disturbances
that will climax around the last week of November 2012.

It's the real proof you can read on about in the next section. For
details on how their plan is doomed to failure, refer to section 1.4.

And always remember:

It's everyone's last Christmas. Have no fear; just have fun.
