Foreword from the author

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
I couldn't really find a working subtitle for this first book in what's
 to become a series.
 Arguably, it's not a book per se (meaning not a full length novel), but
 a book it is still.

Party of Five
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 starts off with this book here, and I envision it as a series of novellas
 that I want to keep writing, evolving the characters and the world as I
 go.
 I could do that it in a full length novel, but it's much easier for me
 to write smaller, self-contained adventures that are linked together through
 the same characters, being fresh and different each time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
Plus, I think a series of novellas can reach an audience faster and it easier
 and more practical (hopefully more fun) to read for most people.
 It is also my opinion that the novella as a genre, needs some more love
 from authors and readers alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
I dearly hope you'll come to like the characters enough to wait for the
 next novella in the series.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The universe, children, is a vast, gloriously beautiful thing that is mostly
 uncaring.
 It's up to us, me, and you, and the common folk as well, to breath a sense
 of justice into it; a balance between right and wrong.
 Careful not to overdo it though, cause it could tip over your heads when
 you least expect it to.
 Like an oxcart full of manure.

\begin_layout Chapter*
Part One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was standing on the docks, watching the good ship Autania as it
 gracefully waded through the peaceful waters of Hobb's Bay; the wind was
 at her stern, her sails full.
 She was making good speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hope the damn thing sinks and they all drown,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a deep scowl on her proud face.
 Behind her, the small harbor was settling into its nightly rhythm.
 Rowdy sailors were looking for the next tavern in line to get drunk and
 have a brawl, the traders were finishing up their business with shady-looking
 characters and the fishermen were readying their nets for the break of
 dawn and their next catch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was sitting right beside her on the stony pier, her naked feet dangling
 in the water.
 She asked Parcifal with a look of tempered sadness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does that mean we can't go back?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, we can't go back Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a sigh and a shook her head.
 Her piercing hazel eyes were stuck gazing somewhere beyond the rosy-red
 horizon, fiddling with her cropped red hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with understanding and raised an eyebrow.
 She noticed Parcifal had an angry, bothersome look about her and knew her
 timing was off.
 But she had to ask her anyway:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not ever?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head slowly around and stabbed Lernea with a fierce
 look before answering coldly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not as long as the Jangdrivals are in power and the Unseen Council remains
 in place, not while the Eleven Pillars stand and the Noble Eagles fly above
 the Skarlas, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Her tone was harsh, unerringly final.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea put a finger on her lip and spent a few moments playing with a lock
 of her long, brown hair.
 She then frowned from frustration and asked her sister once more: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that never ever, or really just a long time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You vex me, sister.
 Never means never,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal dryly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, didn't master Sisyphus always say, `never say never'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with a hesitant smile creeping up on her lip.
 Parcifal's visage turned suddenly sorrowful, like a noble, sleek and gray
 statue in the palace grounds they would never see again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Master Sisyphus is dead, Lernea.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That doesn't mean he was wrong, though.
 Never is such a final word, you know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 retorted Lernea and stood upright on her toes, with hands on her waist.
 She faced her sister with a bright smile full of optimism which Parcifal
 clearly did not share.
 Her sister's attitude made Parcifal's sadness turn into barely suppressed
 anger at Lernea's persistence to face their new reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get it right in that little thick skull of yours, Lernea.
 We are, never, going, back, to, Nomos.
 Never!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, a lone finger rapping at Lernea's breastplate with a clanging
 sound after every word.
 Lernea's eyes wandered to her chest for a moment, before her face reddened
 and her breathing became more pronounced.
 Her nostrils flared up and she turned her gaze at her sister.
 She pouted her lips and said icily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't do that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I think I'll just do what I please from now on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal; her face had the look of a poised hawk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate it when you do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea in the same vein, shaking her head slowly with mounting irritation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know, that's why I do it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're such a child,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea with disdain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Says the one who can't accept defeat!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal's loud tone made a few heads turn and look.
 Lernea did not even notice they were attracting the attention of the locals,
 and added her own shouts to the rising din of their heated debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This isn't about winning or losing, by Skrala! You can't be that daft!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're the one that got us into this mess in the first place, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with arms crossed on her chest.
 Lernea flailed her arms wildly around her while moving about nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, really now that's just so typical, trying to put the blame on me like
 we're still meddling with the master's spellbook!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I'm not the one who married Therion Jangdrival on a whim and got us
 exiled!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 remarked Parcifal with wide open arms and a mocking smile.
 Lernea's reply was filled with overtones of shock and disgust, her face
 screwed up, her revulsion evident in every word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was him or Gheighran! Have you even seen Gheighran? He's a walking swamp-thin
g, not a man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal shook her head and berated her slightly older sister, her face
 suddenly grim and her voice low-keyed and even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that how you make decisions about your kingdom, my Queen? Based on looks
 and appearances? Only if mother were alive..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let her voice trail off and ventured a look towards the ocean.
 The Autania's sail was barely visible, the light of day growing dimmer
 with every passing minute.
 Lernea was looking at her feet, feeling scolded and reprimanded like a
 child.
 Yet, when she talked next she had the voice of a proud woman:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mother made mistakes as well in her reign.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, she did,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal nodding and went on to shout, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She gave birth to you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're only a minute apart, you stupid-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stopped in mid-sentence even as her mouth began to form the word
 `cow'.
 She had instinctively flung her arm and was grabbing at what seemed to
 be a child's arm attached to a hand holding her coinpurse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and turned to look nearly right behind her.
 There was a short person standing there, all dressed up in dark leather
 and an impossibly bland, expressionless face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal grabbed a silver, teardrop-shaped knife from her waistband and
 took a step towards her sister's side where the short person stood frozen,
 said person pretending he was nothing more than a misplaced piece of furniture.
 He seemed to be holding his breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A thieving scum, and a bad one at that, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the short person with a whiz.
 Out of breath, he looked sideways at the bristling knife-point and suddenly
 sucked on air through his nostrils loudly.
 His body relaxed and he let the bulging coinpurse drop to the wooden pier
 with a heavy jingle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea made a grimace and turned her head away from the short man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see why you held that breath of yours.
 Could even kill a man; one of your stature, at least.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed less inclined to comment on the aspiring thief's lack of
 mouth hygiene.
 She looked at him with mixed feelings of curiosity and frustration, brandishing
 her knife accusingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Barely stepped foot on this land, and here's our greeting.
 Couldn't resist our riches, little man?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal, her shiny breastplate protruding from the rest of her body
 armor straight at the thief's face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Be fair, my fair lady! Wasn't ogling your, ehm, lady parts or anything,
 your gracefulness.
 Not that they're not worth to, well, ogle,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with an awkward smile and looked up to Parcifal like a man seeking
 redemption in prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea punched him in the gut without warning; the short little man doubled
 over, his face flustered.
 He looked momentously surprised and awestruck, rather than simply hurt;
 he seemed to have some trouble breathing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She was talking about our money, our armor, our valuables! Really, to address
 any woman in such a fashion.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned and looked at her sister with a bewildered expression, squinting
 her eyes slightly, her knife still aimed at the thief's general direction
 who was trying to stand up again to his full four feet of height.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's all about being a queen proper, isn't it? He was addressing me, not
 you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea grinned and straightened her hair before she mused mostly to herself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You really can't get over the fact I am the firstborn, rightful heir to
 the throne and all that, can you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fact is, you're a spoiled brat if I've ever se-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal left her sentence incomplete as she noticed the coinpurse, as well
 as the thief, had simply vanished out of sight.
 She looked at the milling crowd behind them reflexively.
 In the scarce light of the setting sun she spotted the rather short leather-cla
d thief, idly walking about with his hands in his pockets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She ran after him while Lernea hurriedly put on her boots and followed close
 behind.
 With little effort she nudged her way past a couple of bystanders who were
 idly having a smoke and grabbed the man by his cloak.
 She lifted him up like a runaway child and handed him over to Lernea, who
 grabbed him with both hands from his vest's collar.
 The sisters sported positively miffed, if not thunderous, looks.
 The short little man exploded with furious indignation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do say! What manner of outrage is this now? Bellicose women running rampant
 in the streets? Is there no law, no order in this cauldron of misery and
 debauchery? Guards! Guards!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters looked at the man intently for a moment, examining him like
 some sort of exotic bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's him,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and Lernea nodded affirmatively and added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no mistaking that breath.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man looked at each of them with a deeply hurt, vastly presumptuous look
 and raised a hand before speaking.
 His eyes remained closed haughtily for the better part of his little speech:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can dispense with the insult to my dwarven heritage concerning my breath
 since as a gentleman, I am aware that great allowances should be made for
 differences of custom and training.
 I can understand from your appearance you are foreigners, probably fresh
 off the boat, clearly confused and utterly misguided as to the identity
 of my person.
 Although you are clearly lacking in proper lady-like training and manners,
 such is my gentleness and strength of character, that I am willing to forgo
 any and all legal accusations and forthcoming tribulations against your
 persons, should you deposit me safely and unharmed on the ground so I may
 go about my business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head and looked at Lernea with a raised eyebrow.
 Lernea shot back her sister a familiar look and nodded, before upending
 the short man who claimed to be a dwarf.
 She then proceeded to hold him by his legs and shake him vigorously.
 Other than a couple of bored, curious looks, no-one seemed particularly
 inclined to question what has happening.
 In Hobb's Bay, anything less than a stabbing wasn't a matter of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments later a rush of metallic clangs was heard as various items
 fell on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aha!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea gleefully, while her sister shook her head with an uncertain
 look on her face.
 The short little man who claimed to be a dwarf and a gentleman no less
 was looking at the two ladies sternly, his short grey ponytail swinging
 as he lay hanging upside down, his hands crossed on his chest like some
 sort of human-like bat having a difficult time sleeping.
 His cloak brushed against the items that had fallen from his person; a
 small metallic disc with a chain, a gold, flat square tin like a cigar
 holder, and a small, thin stiletto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal pouted her lips and made a rolling motion with her hands to Lernea,
 which went largely unnoticed.
 Lernea said with a wide grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What say you now, thief?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She made sure to intone the word 
\shape italic
thief
\shape default
 as it meant someone oozing gritty, unhealthy amounts of slime from every
 available orifice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal bulged her eyes and made frantic motions to Lernea to put the man
 down, pointing to the unfamiliar items that had fallen on the ground instead
 of the expected loot, their property.
 Lernea finally took a look on her own and hesitantly put the short man
 back on his own two feet.
 He looked at them with a most severe look that implied he could not find
 the words to begin to describe his feelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I cannot find the words to even begin to describe my feelings,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a face torn from disgust and disdain.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should be ashamed.
 I fear, I cannot in right conscience call you ladies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, dusted off his cloak, straightened his vest and pants and walked
 away briskly without another word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at him in mute disbelief, while Lernea picked up the man's
 items from the ground, spending a mere moment to examine them.
 His small figure had almost disappeared into the mass of people crowding
 the busy street when she shouted at him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir! Terribly sorry, but you forgot your articles, sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at the various stuff the man had left behind and had a moment
 of clarity; she sprang into action, and started running through the street
 shouting to her sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's because those aren't his either!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood motionless for moment, idly holding the stolen goods with both
 hands in her lap.
 Her lips formed a soundless circle while her eyes shone with dazzling ferocity.
 Realizing they had been duped, she dropped everything and ran after her
 sister and the dwarf - or perhaps a simply very short man - who kept surprising
 them with his sly ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man shot a glance behind his back and saw the sisters were right on
 his tail, shoving and brushing people aside as they ran after him.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fire! Fire! I say, fire!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted amidst the crowd in an effort to cause a little bit of hysterical
 panic to make his escape all that easier.
 That didn't work though; the people around him went about their business,
 a few casually wondering to themselves whether or not they had heard some
 kind of voice; those who did hear wondered where it came from.
 He had to make himself scarce the hard way, and bolted into the nearest
 building.

 doorway.
 Sounds of drunken merriment and folk music blasted away from the relatively
 large inn.

Inside the Sniggering Pig, there was ample candle light from chandeliers
 on the high ceiling, as well as candles and lamps on each and every table
 where people had still not passed out.
 A powerful mix of heavy scents dominated the air; rye, ale and roasted
 meat.
 The tables were mostly occupied by rowdy gangs of shady-looking sailors;
 everyone seemed to be having fun judging by the spillage on the floor,
 when the music suddenly stopped.
 The hubbub of laughter and loud conversation filled the emptiness until
 a rather tall and lanky fellow appeared at the far end of tavern, on what
 seemed to be the stage where the band of musicians sat.
 Parcifal's eyes had the chance to search the room for a moment.
 There was no sign of the thief.

Dwarf.

\begin_layout Standard
As if on cue, the tall lank man who had appeared on stage cleared his throat
 loudly and bowed, only to receive a handful of drunken irrelevant yells,
 most prominently, `Show us yer tittays!'.
 Nevertheless, he smiled courteously and said to the crowd:

Well, this place is lively, ain't it? Feels like a band of roaming Dwarves

 Hell, it's not like they're set in stone or anything,

 he said, grinning widely and posing to the crowd which hardly noticed anyone
 was talking on stage.
 The performer was facing a tough crowd.
 He turned to the band of musicians and said in voice right above a whisper:

 The sound was not unlike a couple of coconuts banging together.

 something else.
 She told Lernea:

Lernea let out a little laugh, more aptly a snigger, and put a hand to her

 Parcifal eyed her in puzzlement, her brow furrowed.
 Lernea replied with a giggly voice:

Parcifal closed her eyes, said nothing and sighed.
 Then she slowly started wading through the tables, filled with passed-out

 The comedian was having a go at another joke, while the crowd had mysteriously
 quietened down.
 Lots of sets of eyes were now following Parcifal's slender form as she
 moved about the tavern.

The drum roll came on cue, but the laughter he was expecting was delayed

Barkeep! Ha ha ha! I gets it! Bar-keep!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spontaneously, half the tavern erupted in fits of laughter, while the other
 half lay motionless except for their eyes, magnetized by Parcifal's presence.
 Even if staring at her meant her staring back at them with a look that
 could shrivel their scrotum and turn their eyes into tiny glass beads.
 The comedian went on:

Lovely crowd here tonight, lovely crowd.

\begin_layout Standard
There was no drum roll.
 The man on stage eyed the band and waved his hands.
 Then came a drum roll and the signature cowbell.
 The crowd though wasn't paying attention; they kept drinking and singing
 rowdy songs, mostly containing obscene lyrics about unicorns and the priest's
 daughter.
 There was a voice of dissent though that rose sharply above the cacophony:

\begin_layout Standard
It was the thief, all flustered, standing up on his toes to make himself
 heard.
 Parcifal turned her head around and saw him, pointing an accusing finger
 at the man on stage.
 She drew her sword and shouted above the din of the crowd, cradling the
 heavy blade threateningly towards the thief:

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly the crowd stopped everything they had been doing; the singing ceased
 to be.
 The band on the other hand, much to the comedian's dismay, started to play
 a suspenseful tune.
 The sound of whistling pipes was dominant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Every other night, no-one reads the sign,

 He did try to get everyone's attention though:

Excuse me now, I'm sure there's been some kind of misunderstanding.

Balls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 they said in one voice and everyone was suddenly holding something that
 could kill, maim, or hurt like hell, most prominently forks, knives and
 the odd cutlass and pistol.
 Parcifal stood in the midst of them all, perhaps fifty or sixty men the
 lot of them, half of them still conscious.
 She gave Lernea a look of determined despair and grasped her sword with
 both hands, ready for what seemed to be a sudden, uneven fight to the death.
 Lernea nodded to her sister without a word and loaded her bow with an arrow.
 In one fluid motion, she was already aiming at the thief's head from a
 very comfortable distance; she couldn't miss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thief looked at her, grinned, bowed slightly and yelled:

Jambalaya everyone! I'm buying!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd erupted in sudden cheers and howls, while someone yelled `Balls!'
 right before slumping down on the floor.
 The comedian got off the stage disheartened and headed for the bar.
 The band picked up a serene ballad that no-one really cared for.
 The barkeep smiled congenially to the comedian and told him: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal and Lernea were standing amidst the merry crowd with their weapons
 at the ready, but it was evident in the way their faces were screwed up
 that they felt relieved, confused and mildly insulted at the same time.
 Parcifal would not leave the thief from her sight; he approached her with
 both hands in the air, making sure his palms were open.
 He was smiling thinly, looking at Encelados with a keen, respectful eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea lowered her bow and strung it behind her back.
 She walked over to her sister, being very careful not to tread on someone
 or someone's heaved insides, spilled beer and other assorted spots of trouble
 that could be found on the Sniggering Pig's floor in abundance.

\begin_layout Standard

Well, I'm not the stubborn, hot-headed, beautiful though foreign lady.

 Lernea stood by her sister's side and pondered for a moment before she
 said with a calm voice:

I think there's a reason for all this, sister.

 said the small man with a slight bow and a smile, before showing the sisters

 Parcifal looked at the man as he had insulted everything holy by Skrala

 She told her:

Now sister, this calls for some diplomacy.

Parcifal couldn't believe her ears, but followed along as if in some kind

 Winceham led the way and drew their chairs charmingly.
 As they sat down he made a motion with a hand to the bar, always smiling.
 Parcifal said as if still in a dream:

You knew that, didn't you? You saw us get off the boat, saw we smelled money

Then suddenly, the door to the Sniggering Pig Inn swung with an eerie creaking
 noise, unusually louder than the din of the laughing, merry sailors.
 A large bulky man dressed in a scaly leather vest, matching boots and cornered

 The music stopped abruptly.

 he yelled and spat a vile green lump of slime on the floor.
 Beside him stood a tall, ape-like creature dressed mostly in rugs and cloth,
 all muscle and hair.
 It carried a blunderbuss as tall as a man and grinned widely, its mouth
 filled with golden teeth.
 Like a silent church bell had rung, everyone, even the band, promptly picked
 up their hats and passed-out companions and left in a hurry, though the
 last man was mindful to enough to close the door behind him.
 Winceham reached out and touched the sisters' hands awkwardly; he had a
 desperate look on his face.

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged troubled looks.
 They shot glances at the man who had practically ordered everyone to leave

 There was fearful anxiety written there; the sisters shared their opinion

 Ned appeared from behind the bar, holding the sisters' coinpurse, still

Winceham rolled his eyes wildly trying to signal the sisters.
 His efforts went largely unnoticed since they had both turned to face what

 Parcifal had drawn her sword and was pointing it at Culliper's back.
 He slowly turned around and saw Lernea had also nocked an arrow, ready
 to draw at the blink of an eye.

 said Lernea who let an arrow fly right between Mr.
 Brumbles eyes before he had a chance to even swerve the gun their way.
 A gunshot rang clear though; Culliper was holding a pistol with smoldering
 smoke trailing off its barrel.
 Ned's father was down on the floor with a dull thud barely a moment later.
 Parcifal sprang at Culliper with all the might of her sword, but he parried
 expertly with his cutlass as he turned to leave.
 Lernea was reloading her bow even as Ned cried in outrage,

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper jumped up on a nearby table and rushed towards a window.
 Lernea's arrow caught him on the shoulder.
 He cried in agony even as Ned was rushing right behind him.
 Parcifal saw the barrel of a pistol aiming blindly towards Ned, even as
 Culliper made ready to jump through the window; she did not hesitate and
 grabbed Ned by his waist as he run.
 She brought him down right when a bullet flew over his head and turned
 part of the wooden bar into a bunch of smoldering splinters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper crashed through the window and onto the street.
 He landed on one side, rolled, and quickly got back on his feet.
 He glanced at them and then ran away cursing even as one of Lernea's arrows
 grazed his back.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Quickly!

Why are you just standing there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked, even though no-one was technically standing.
 Parcifal was on her knees, nurturing a hurt jaw.
 She had a bloody lip and she was staring at Ned like a wounded tiger.
 Ned was lying with his back against the bar, a stream of tears trailing
 his cheeks, his face flustered.
 Winceham was sitting on the same chair as before, his face planted smugly
 in the palms of his hands in complete silence.

\begin_layout Standard

He punched me in the face,

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was wholly ignoring her, his face a mask of stone cold grief.
 His tears had just began to dry out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea suddenly looked deeply disappointed, almost heartbroken, as she held
 an arrow in one hand and her bow in the other, her shoulders sagged.
 She shook her head, put the arrow in her quiver and the bow across her
 back before she pointed a finger at Parcifal and said with a numb voice
 to no-one in particular:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters both turned to look at him with an even gaze.
 They met his blood-ridden eyes and with a glance saw his father's lifeless
 body on the floor to his right.
 They stooped their heads low and crossed their arms on their chests before
 they told him humbly in unison:

Ned looked at them with menace, a sudden viciousness in the young man's
 otherwise gentle, homely face.
 His voice was calm, but it somehow managed to sound brazen, harsh and vibrant:
\end_layout

My father has no need for keen wails and haughty words.
 He's dead and dead men have no need of anything other than a grave.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters remained silent, neither one venturing to speak her mind.
 Winceham broke the silence when he rubbed his face with both hands along
 with a loud snorting noise, as if he had forced himself to awaken from
 a deep slumber.
 He caused everyone, even Ned, to turn their heads his way.

\begin_layout Standard

Now you've done it, you really have.

 the inn.

\begin_layout Standard

Halfuin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Winceham and went on after he tried to sip from an empty cup.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You could've just bought the act.
 And then, again, you could have just let Culliper take the damn money.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Our money,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It still is just money,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham with a sneer, before he went on.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would have kept Vern alive and this place going for some time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and waved a hand around.
 He picked up a small satchel from the floor and told them: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We've tarried too long.
 By midnight, Hobb's men will be scouring the Bay.
 I suggest you make yourselves scarce as well and keep a low profile.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded at the two sisters and said with a dry voice: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dump the gear as well, you two,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before he turned to Ned and said with a weary look and a bleak voice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry, Ned.
 There is no perfect plan.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Ned replied with a deep, rumbling hatred in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll kill his men.
 And then I'll kill him, with my bare hands.
 I want to see him beg for his life before I squeeze his last breath out

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had a feral look about him; a keen, proud gaze.
 It was as if he had been Ned's long lost twin, a battle-hardened warrior
 who sought revenge.
 In truth, he was still little more than the meek, aspiring bard son of
 Vern Larkin, doubling as the inn's cook.
 And Winceham told him so, trying not to sound unkind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Lad, you've a fiery heart, I'll give you that.
 But it's in the wrong place.

Parcifal interjected with a nod of approval:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

At least he is a man, red blood coursing through his veins.
 Willing to spill other men's blood, no less,

and quite a punch.
 Better than his jokes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Winceham's face frowned and turned to look at Parcifal with an impossible

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I beg your pardon, milady, but surely, you're sorely mistaken.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea approached the rest and came to stand by her sister's side with a
 regal smile painted on her face, her hands on her hips.
 She pointed a finger at Winceham as if he was some kind of lowly subject
 of hers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You, halfuin, you are the one who is sorely mistaken.

Winceham sighed and stared at the empty cup for a while.
 He then told Lernea:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You figured all that out by yourself? And I thought, Nomos was full of stupid

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea went wide-eyed in shocked surprise.
 Before she had time to retort, Parcifal had her sword drawn, poised in
 front of Winceham's chest, ready to pierce his heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Forswear that insult! Unsay it or Encelados be your last woe!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Parcifal with a blistering voice.
 Winceham, seeing the steely tip of Encelados flash brightly in the candlelight,
 spoke faster than perhaps ever, in one breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You do have a penchant for the dramatic, don't you? I was only making an
 effort to be sarcastic.
 Since it seems to be an idea foreign to you, I'm particularly sorry I ever
 said such a thing so as to raise your deadly ire.
 I therefore renounce my comment, recant the implication of an insult, renege
 my former statement and repudiate my previous statement regarding your
 noble persons.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Parcifal sheathed her sword and calmness returned to her face, while Lernea
 found the clarity of mind to reply properly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No need to mock us with fancy words, sir,

 she said, and forced a thin smile on her mouth.
 She went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We know enough about sarcasm to not use it in serious matters.
 We've been trained in languages and the arts, as well as the ways of the
 sword, bow and armor.
 Such is the way of Nomos; we are not simpletons, mind you.
 We are warrior-maidens of the Mountain Garden, not simple women who would
 rather spent their days serving a lowly, unworthy husband as their master.
 We demand respect and earn it our way; we obey the laws but listen to our

 We serve Skrala, until Svarna guides us to the Eternal Light.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea managed to awe everyone into stilled silence, including her sister.
 Winceham managed to nod, yet enchanted by Lernea's presence.
 The silence was broken by Ned, who took Lernea by the arm suddenly and
 spoke from heart, the words rushing freely out his mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You've spoken true milady; even a fool would feel that.
 I know this then; that you and your sister are noble women, with brave,

 Help me avenge my father's death, miladies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked at Ned with a surprised half-smile; it seemed he was being
 utterly serious and fully aware of what such an oath entailed.
 Parcifal saw her sister's face brighten up.
 She placed her hand gently on Ned's shoulder and told him heartily:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's no need for that Ned.
 We are free women and our people, are free people; we do not offer them

 We are honored that you ask this of us; we shall avenge your father's demise,

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's face was overcome by a hard, edgy smile that crept up on his lips.
 He nodded solemnly and offered his arm to Parcifal which she grasped firmly.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a set of proud eyes and said with a
 hint of admiration:

Winceham on the other hand was half-way towards the doorway of the Sniggering

Do you even hear yourselves? I can understand Ned is upset and has little

 He went on promptly as soon as Lernea nodded matter-of-factly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He does as he pleases and that is due to two things; money and power.
 Money keeps his henchmen, guards and foot soldiers happy to work and even
 die occasionally for him, as do the crews on his ships roaming the seas
 for loot and plunder.
 That same money, the money he keeps making by bleeding everyone just short
 of dry, just like he did to Vern and the Sniggering Pig.
 That money bought him an Imperial Consulate and soon if word has it right,
 a place as Princeps of the Court.

 Winceham smiled with irony and said:

 Lernea told them, and Winceham retorted:

No, you'll have a retired thief and a bard who can't sing and tells bad

 Lernea asked Ned, cocking her head sideways.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why do you think you caught me red-handed both times? My joints have been

 Lernea's words had a hint of arrogance about them:

I see.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham eying Ned with a look of disappointment before returning
 his gaze to Lernea and adding: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And then when you learn I'm retired, I'm suddenly worthless.
 Great management skills for a queen,

 said Winceham, looking irreparably emotionally hurt.

She didn't see the Jangdrivals coming either.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned intervened:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Stop this, please.
 Stop this badmouthing.
 It leads nowhere.
 If we are going to do this, we need to stick together; we need to support

 Or else, no matter who stands against us, it will be an easy fight for
 them if we fight amongst ourselves.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone took a moment in silence.
 Parcifal and Lernea looked at each other briefly, reassuringly.
 Winceham nodded to himself and pouted his lips before speaking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need a plan.
 A damn good plan preferably of the genius kind with implausibly good luck
 to boot.
 But first, we need to leave this place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and picked up his satchel, looking sideways through the window
 for any sign of Hobb's men.
 Parcifal and Lernea nodded and checked their gear smartly, while Ned shook
 his head and curtly said:

Ned, lad.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stared at Winceham unyieldingly for a few moments, until they all looked
 at each other and simply walked over to the body of Ned's father and helped
 him carry the body of Vern Larkin out back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was on the lookout, while Ned, Parcifal and even Lernea, much to
 her sister's surprise, began to dig in a hurry.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal who had taken point alongside Ned, Encelados firmly clasped
 on her back along with her shield, Erymanthos.
 Tiny slithers of starlight bounced off her glistening armor; the Holy Mountain
 engraved on Erymanthos shone fiery red.
 This far south in the world, the light of the starry sky was good enough
 for walking without hitting a tree.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Father and I used to hunt boar around these parts.
 We'd find traces of the Woodkin here and there; tripped animal traps and

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Ned with certainty, his eyes wading through the darkness of the
 night warily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned struck the others as a fairly common young man; not too short, not taller
 than Parcifal.
 He carried an old hunting crossbow strung along the belt at his waist.
 With his pitch black hair and light cloth garments, he gave the impression
 of some sort of romantic fool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That image was enhanced by the small leather drum he carried around on his

How can you be sure it was elves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham slightly out of breath as he tried to keep pace with the
 rest, his satchel bobbing wildly.
 Ned's reply was taciturn at best:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A somewhat uneasy silence followed.
 Lernea gracefully trod through the thick, lush brush as if this southern,
 exotic forest was her natural habitat.
 At length she too felt the need to ask Ned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

These elves you speak of, what makes you so certain they'll want to help?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned paused in his stride, turned around and looked at Lernea with a grin
 that shone unnervingly even though the light of the stars was barely enough
 to see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said loudly, his voice echoing faintly as it bounced off the surrounding
 hills.
 He resumed walking alongside Parcifal, his eyes glancing at everyone with
 obvious aggravation; apparently, he wasn't in the mood for questions.
 The others exchanged doubtful looks, but knew that for the time being,
 questions would serve no purpose other than driving Ned slightly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had been slowly climbing Silkcrest Hill, no more than an hour's reach
 from Hobb's Bay to the west.
 The minute after they had finished burying Ned's father, they had heard
 a rather rowdy crowd on the street, asking for them to come out and be
 hanged for the murders they had committed.
 Hobb seemed fairly adept at putting the blame on people and rousing the
 masses into an angry mob; Ned, Winceham and the Teletha sisters were wanted
 for murder, jaywalking and unlawful pillaging to boot.
 Without the need to talk it over, they fled Hobb's bay through obscure
 alleys and deserted back streets onto the nearby woods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned had come up with what was now effectively their grand plan, which wasn't
 much as everyone had commented, but it was their best shot.
 Not to mention, as Winceham had put it, their only and perhaps their last
 one as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They'd seek out the secretive Woodkin elves that some said dwelt deep in
 the jungle where death lurked in many forms: quicksand, and poisoned plants
 made the jungle perilous to cross, while snakes, rockatoos, crocodiles
 and venom spiders tried to literally lived on reckless travelers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham made a gesture with his hands, stopped and bent over his knees;
 his face was a grimace, his lungs burning from the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can't stop now, not until we've found them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a sense of urgency.
 He sounded annoyed, but there was tiredness in his tone as well.
 The sisters nodded and Parcifal unsheathed Encelados; she promptly buried
 it into the ground with ease.
 Lernea sat down on the ground and unclasped a bright, silver canteen from
 her belt.
 She brought it to her lips and drank, before offering it to Winceham who
 gladly downed a mouthful himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Ned in utter disbelief, even though it was plainly obvious they were
 taking a break.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can't march all through the night without some rest, Ned.
 Not us, not you, and certainly not half-man there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal and pointed to Winceham with a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin.
 Do I need to spell it out to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Winceham retorted huffing and puffing copiously.
 He shot Parcifal a weary look and sat down himself with a growl of exertion.
 He shook his head and said somewhat bitterly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You wouldn't have gone that far now, would you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, her words not unkind but rather playful judging by the thin
 smile on her face.
 Her look became suddenly worried though when she noticed Ned had already
 wandered off westwards, without so much as a word, like a stubborn child
 would.
 Lernea gave Parcifal a stern look which her sister waved away.
 Parcifal shrugged, resting with her hands around Encelados hilt, the blade's
 tip firmly dug in the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 she said as she looked at Ned's figure growing smaller in the growing distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he's bound to get lost or do something stupid.
 Or both.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Lernea and swiftly set after Ned on her own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham stretched.
 Some faint popping and crackling sounds were heard; he let out a sigh and
 fiddled with his satchel.
 After a while he was holding a small leather pouch and a small, delicate
 pipe in his hands.
 Those items seemed to instantly attract Parcifal's attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she asked bluntly, cocking her head sideways as if trying to peek.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does it look like to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham without affording her even a glance, too busy filling his
 pipe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Some sort of pipe, perhaps?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Parcifal with carefully measured uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm surprised someone imparted with such a high level of intelligence would
 be so levelheaded as to ask men of lesser caliber like my person such paltry
 questions for the mere sake of conversation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and lit his pipe, drawing in the smoke deeply.
 A smile of pure joy formed on his face and he laid himself flat on the
 ground, little wisps of smoke twirling intensely wherever starlight poured
 through as they wafted upwards around his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal turned her head around to venture a look towards her sister and
 Ned.
 Her eyes searched for them intently but she could barely make their shadows
 further up the hill, shrouded by the tall grass.
 They seemed to have stopped and they were probably talking by the way she
 saw her sister flailing her hands about her.
 She then asked Winceham with a rather peculiar voice, as if she was concerned
 someone might overhear them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could I .
 .
 .
 Could I have a whiff of that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham sat upright slowly and opened his eyes languidly; they were red-shot,
 covered in a slightly glazed sheen.
 He looked all-too serene and calm, his face adorned with a lopsided smile
 that verged on drooling.
 He simply passed Parcifal the pipe and nodded as if his head weighed a
 ton, his eyes half-open as if about to yawn and fall asleep to never wake
 up again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal leaned toward Winceham and took the proffered pipe in one hand.
 She took a drag and held it before closing her eyes, her lip curling in
 a slight grin.
 She then blew out the smoke in the shape of small circles, before handing
 back the pipe.
 She straightened her back and stood watchful as ever Encelados always clasped
 in her hands, her gaze and indeed her whole face standing out in the night,
 prouder and brighter than before.
 It was a stark contrast to the way Winceham looked, which resembled someone
 who had just woken up from a really rough night that involved all sorts
 of debauchery and a lynch mob.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey..
 What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham as he looked back and forth between Parcifal and the pipe
 with an expression of amazed wonder as if something miraculously extraordinary
 had happened right in front of his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he thought he saw a pair of trembling flames behind a nearby bush.
 He blinked and saw the flames flicker wildly, before vanishing swiftly
 with a harrowing speed.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What in all blazes? I must be having a bad trip,

 said Winceham mostly to himself and put out his pipe.
 Parcifal overheard him and commented:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not that rough of a trail.
 When my sister and I had to go through the trails of Jordenfall though..
 That was rough, I'll tell you that.
 Sheer cliffs, hundreds of feet high, slippery ice every step of the way

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Her face was cringing but her voice carried a bitter sweetness.
 It was the voice of someone who reminisced better times.
 Winceham eyed her with a worried look, his brow furrowed.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure you're okay? Not feeling lightheaded, sleepy, giggly, silly,

 She took a moment to think, shook her head and replied earnestly:

\end_inset

No..
 Couldn't be better.
 Top notch.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was looking at her puzzled beyond understanding when his eyes bulged
 up with sudden terror.
 He saw the trembling flames from before, trailing orange light in their
 wake.
 They were attached to the head of furry white bunny where its eye sockets
 should be; the hopped about, not further than a few feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham's jaw dropped and he looked at his pipe before staring at the bunny
 mesmerized.
 The bunny paused as if it knew, stared back at Winceham and smiled unnervingly
 before hopping out of view and into a burrowing hole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Did you see that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he exclaimed as he got up on his feet and poked Parcifal in the arm repeatedly.
 She was instantly energized; she drew Encelados out of the ground and swung
 it around her wrist expertly, poised to strike unerringly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Winceham with an unsteady voice and pulled out a stiletto from his
 belt.
 The blade was dull, thin and long like a spike.
 It had been quite some time since it had been last used.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Great, that's great.
 I'm not having a bad trip, it's just that something actually weird is going
 on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and sighed.
 He collected his thoughts for a moment before trying to convince Parcifal
 that a strange rabbit with flaming eyes was in the vicinity.
 He felt that stressing the flaming eyes bit was essential since normal
 rabbits when mixed with fire can't hop, at least not when roasting on a
 spit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal, look.
 It might seem strange but there's a bunny with its eyes on fire hopping
 around us.
 I think it saw us.
 We must be very careful, stay still and keep our voices down.
 I can't stress enough that it's eyes are on fire and it's not dead yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham as he scanned the area around them inch by inch, expecting
 to catch a glimpse of the strange rabbit.
 Parcifal eyed the man with a sudden sorrow and shook her head, feeling
 sorry for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Poor Mr.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then as if out of nowhere a robed, hooded and masked man sprang from a nearby
 bush behind Parcifal and leaned respectfully towards her ear.
 The man waved his hands and fingers in an elaborate gesture and whispered
 to her in a thin, gentle voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is no bunny.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was stunned into silence.
 He was thinking that perhaps he should point out that there was a strange
 man right behind Parcifal whispering to her ear, but decided to wait until
 she acknowledged that herself, just to make sure he wasn't imagining things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal as she turned around to face the stranger with Encelados
 readied in her hand.
 She appeared calm, yet mindful of the stranger who seemed to be unarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No answer came.
 Instead the man simply stood there, frozen like a statue, his hands clasped
 together as if in prayer.
 His eyes remained closed and he hardly seemed to breathe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Will you not answer me, stranger?

 Parcifal demanded of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe he's right, maybe there is no bunny,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 muttered Winceham when he suddenly saw the same white bunny as before break
 through the ground from behind Parcifal.
 It stood there with it's eyes locked directly onto Winceham's gaze.
 Its nose twitched and Winceham saw the flames flash wildly for a moment,
 right before an intense feeling of chillness crept up his spine and made
 the hairs on his head stand.
 Then he saw the rabbit grin at him mischievously, dig back in and disappear
 from sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was pointing to the ground in stunned silence, with eyes wide open
 and his arm trembling when Parcifal said to the silent stranger:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am Parcifal Teletha, scion of Phedra Teletha and Helios of the Teletha

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her tone was noble yet carried determined menace.
 It was easy for someone to see she meant every word by her thunderous stare.
 The man opened his right eye, peeked at her momentarily, and then closed
 it and simply stood there just like before, as if choosing to ignore her.

\begin_layout Standard

 She added with exasperation:

I don't care about your delusions! What manner of person is this man who

 Winceham had no other option but try to sound convincing yelling at the

Winceham and Parcifal turned and looked at Lernea with red, flustered faces

 She threw them a scolding stare but what caught her eye was the strange

 She was confused for a moment.
 When she stared back at him with all the nobility she could muster under

 he said to Lernea, stressing the last word as if the absurdness contained

Lernea and Parcifal exchanged a quick look.
 Parcifal nodded affirmatively while Lernea replied with an indifferent
 shrug.
 Winceham said then visibly irritated:

I beg your pardon! Bo is not a monster!

 said the robed man insulted, instantly letting go off his prohibitions
 concerning the fact he was completely visible to everyone involved.
 He took off his mask and hood as well, revealing long fair and silver dreadlock
s of hair, and a pair of pointy ears that stood effortlessly upright.
 He protested:

Bo is very kind and completely harmless.
 Not a monster at all.

Yes, who are you? And how come your hair is that fair and weird-looking

Ned's right.

Bo? He's always around, I wouldn't worry about him.

You're Woodkin, aren't you?

 The stranger gasped; he was once more shocked into silence for a moment

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How...

 he said with a tremor in his voice.

Winceham cut in abruptly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The pointy ears, the fair, weird hair.
 The silly hood and mask.
 That's just like you people.

The stranger shot an off-beat glance at Winceham and managed to sound actually

We even know the bunny by name, but not yours.

 said Parcifal and raised Encelados threateningly.
 Ned lowered her arm and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down now.
 What is your name, woodkin?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The woodkin looked at the sword's blade respectfully and then addressed
 Ned with a slight bow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

My name is Hanultheofodor Trypthwifidyr.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned seemed to cringe at the thought of uttering the name fully, so he simply
 offered his hand and smile thinly but reassuringly.
 The woodkin obliged him somewhat awkwardly after noticing that everyone
 had their eyes fixed on him.
 As he shook hands with Ned, Lernea told him:

Take us to your leader!

They passed a series of crests and low hills shrouded in ever-thickening
 bush and tall, wide-trunked trees.
 The savanna forest had indeed turned into a jungle proper, full of mangroves
 and palm trees, thick grub and lush flower plants blocking their way.
 `Theo', which was how everyone called Hanultheofodor for practical purposes,
 knew the terrain well enough to avoid the thicker parts, but occasionally
 he had to use his machete to cut a path through.
 The air smelled of sweet but deadly flowers and acrid sweat as the wetness
 of the place became bothersome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their progress was just as slow as before; Parcifal had dubbed it half-man
 pace and Winceham had insisted on at least calling it a halfuin pace for
 the sake of proper interspecies etiquette.
 He had quietened down soon afterward though when he became acutely aware
 that being so short and therefore close to the jungle floor bed was disadvantag
eous at best; the realisation came after he had stepped on a snake thicker
 than his arm and longer than imagination allowed for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snake had been easily dealt with a chop from Parcifal's blade.
 She made Winceham owe her one and even placed a bet that he'd owe her more
 further down the road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the woodkin village still out of view, Parcifal and Theo were leading
 the way.
 Encelados was drawn in her hand should anything try and surprise them;
 she had more than balked at the idea of using her blade as a grass-cutter.
 Even Lernea admonished she had only once seen her sister so frightfully
 indignant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked silently, taking care not to step on something that could bite
 back, each one lost in their own thoughts, for their own reasons.
 At length, Theo asked Parcifal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So none of them followed you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

None that we could see, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which reminds me, I have to ask: How is it that your sister could see me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal found the question nonsensical at best, but her blinking stare
 failed to convey that feeling to Theo.
 He waited for an answer, smiling affably, while the only thing Parcifal
 could conjure in words was:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that a question? You want to know how it is that my sister could see
 you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course! Counter-spelling an illusionist's Ethereal Trance is a remarkable
 feat for someone not versed in the art of Choujou,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and Parcifal raised an eyebrow.
 She suspected Theo, their informal but helpful impromptu guide, had thought
 he could turn invisible for some weird reason that might or might not include
 an unreasonable amount of dreamhops or fuddlegrass, just like the kind
 Winceham had shared with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You are the illusionist you are referring to, I'd wager?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Indeed.
 Are you familiar with the Choujou school of magic?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not really, no,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal with a weary voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ah, its tradition goes back thousands of years.
 The ever-grazing mist of time has long ago obscured its deepest secrets,
 but my people have preserved its legacy and the source of its real power,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he cut a thick, rich cluster of foliage with a few chops of
 his machete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was suddenly intrigued at the mention of the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

power
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

my people
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 The thought came to her that perhaps Ned had been right to convince them
 to seek the Woodkin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was, if of course the rest of Theo's kin had a firm grasp of this witchcraf
t he talked about.
 Because it was her informed opinion that the young woodkin elf was a bit
 lightheaded, to put it mildly.
 She had no idea what to make of his peculiar animal companion though, other
 than stew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo hopped in and out of the ground, the flames in his eyes lighting up the
 path ahead with a warm orange light.
 The bunny would at times pause, raise itself on its hind legs and shoot
 the party a glance before burrowing in the ground, only to appear a couple
 of minutes later down the path as suddenly as it had disappeared.
 But it never strayed away from Theo for too long; that did not escape Winceham'
s attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See it? There; and there it is again.
 It just keeps doing that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham to Ned with a raspy, aggravated voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's just a bunny, Winceham.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned shook his head and looked at Winceham sideways while he said: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's just your imagination, Winceham.
 It's been a long, difficult night and it's only a couple of hours until

\begin_layout Standard

 asked Winceham with a worried expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Like he said, it's some condition or other.
 I've heard of stranger things; of wild beasts that will turn you into stone,

 A rabbit with flaming eyes doesn't sound all that dangerous.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Those were the drunken tales of rabid sailors, Ned! While this..

 said Winceham with a half-crazed look on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I recall yourself as well sharing such morbid tales of fascinating creatures

 Could this be just another fantasy of yours?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned with a gentle smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham made a gesture of acceptance with both hands and replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, I may have from time to time exaggerated concerning some of my former
 adventures, especially when women and riches were mentioned, but it was
 merely in order to put some polish in the boring details.
 This though.
 .

 This rabbit.
 It has its eye on me, I tell you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stopped and took Winceham by the shoulder.
 His face became grim, his voice unusually stern and cold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've invoked Nadragatea on you, Winceham.
 This is one tale you'll have to follow to the end, you know that.
 Don't just pretend; your life depends on that as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham looked instantly and genuinely hurt; his eyes searched Ned's face
 for signs of the young lad who had grown into as much as a friend as his
 father.
 He saw little of the boy he remembered; instead, he was looking at a strong-wil
led man, indeed more than the boy's father had ever been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're right laddie, I'm full of it.
 Well, sometimes.
 I'm just saying, I don't like that bunny one bit, that's all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, sounding apologetic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded with an understanding look.
 He motioned them to move on again even as Lernea caught up from behind,
 where she had been scouting from the last hilltop they had climbed down
 from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing, for as far as I could see.
 No-one is on our trail.
 If someone's out this far to get us, they're probably lost someplace or
 coming at us from a totally different direction.
 No torches or lamps, or light of any kind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, a little short on breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't know what to expect from Hobb.
 It does make sense though; they sent a mob after us, but we weren't there.
 As long as we're out of the picture, Hobb will have the Sniggering Pig
 to himself anyway.
 As far as he's concerned, we've turned tail and ran, never to show our
 faces again,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned told Lernea, who in turn asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What about the ape-man? Won't that man, Culliper, seek revenge for his comrade?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Culliper?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cut in Winceham with a snorting laughter full of disbelief and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sea-maggot is a slave-driver, pure and simple.
 The only thing he cares about is his hide and his loot.
 For the right coin, Culliper could be working for anyone.
 Though I hear those ape-men are hard to come by, I wouldn't worry about
 Culliper.
 Not until we meet him on our own terms.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded in agreement.
 He had a bitter, austere look carved across his face when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You leave Culliper to me when the time comes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

When the time comes, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Winceham with rare somberness.
 Lernea was about to ask something when she saw her sister only a few dozen
 yards up ahead signal a message with her hands.
 Parcifal had stooped low, her gaze wandering, searching for something in
 the night.
 Lernea nocked an arrow when she saw Encelados' suddenly glow faintly; the
 glow became stronger with every passing moment.
 She signaled back at Parcifal who acknowledged with a simple nod.
 She had to reign in Theo's mouth with her free hand.
 It seemed to her that the woodkin had a very vague idea of danger, as something
 that could only affect other people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A faint hope of Winceham being mistaken in his assumption that something
 was amiss sprung up inside him.
 He felt he had to ask in a low voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The sword's glowing? Is that normal?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

She simply shook her head and without turning her head replied:

Something evil lurks nearby.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ned fed a bolt in his crossbow and readied it in his hand, even as Winceham
 drew his stiletto and headed off amidst the thick brush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned with urgency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I'll scout around.
 Need to make myself sparse if I am to strike from the shadows, lad.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a moonless night, there's shadows everywhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned sounding confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Exactly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and nodded to Lernea who afforded him a thin grin.
 Within a few moment, he had melted away into the shadows that abounded,
 as if he'd never really been there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How did he do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Lernea to Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's a thief,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned as they warily made their way closer to Parcifal and Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Retired,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she hissed and Ned simply shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Makes for a weak alibi in some lands,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he replied and Lernea shook her head.
 As they approached Parcifal, they saw her hand-signaling furiously; her
 face was almost obscured in the shadow of a nearby tree but they could
 see her face was taut with bone-breaking intensity.
 The hand signals were confused, hasty; Lernea couldn't make out what her
 sister was trying to tell her in silence.
 She shook her head and waved her to repeat, while Ned was right beside
 her, aiming his crossbow at a thick patch of utter blackness that seemed
 most inviting for something that could be lurking out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then noticed the bunny; it was looking straight at him, the flames from
 his eyes having died down to a pair of crackling embers.
 The bunny curled its tiny lips into an impossible grin just for Ned alone
 to see and hurriedly burrowed inside the ground in an instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal seemed to sigh even as Encelados began to glow fiercely, casting
 harrowing shadows of Parcifal and Theo around the thick brush.
 Parcifal repeated her message but to no avail; Lernea shook her head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is she trying to say?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's either large flying beast lurking on the treetops or mythical magical
 beast wandering up ahead, I can't tell.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned swallowed hard at that piece of information; he couldn't understand
 what the difference really was, so he simply asked, his voice trembling
 slightly, hinting of mounting tension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How is one, better news than the other?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's really important to know which one's which.
 I claim flying kills first, while Parcifal claims the land-dwellers,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said matter-of-factly as she signaled her sister they were about to
 sprint within whispering distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, isn't that wonderful? What happens if it's a sea creature, or something
 that lives underground?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked ironically, surprised at the nonchalance of Lernea, as well as
 his own reaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Coin toss,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as the irony was lost on her.
 She nearly dragged Ned alongside her as they ran, stooping low, to cover
 the distance between Parcifal and them.
 Their feet shuffled over the thick boggy ground with a squishy noise.
 When they were within earshot, Parcifal turned around and whispered to
 her sister:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I said, it's a bleeding flying lizard!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which Theo managed to answered promptly when he finally pushed Parcifal's
 hand aside.
 Completely heedless of the need to remain as silent as possible, he made
 sure to stand up in order to deliver his point more acutely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's utterly absurd! It's not a lizard, that's a dragonkin pure and simple.
 It is a fairly easy mistake to make though, since-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo was cut mid-sentence as a loud screeching noise like a sad, horrific
 growl was quickly followed by the figure of a muscular, nine-foot tall
 lizard-like creature swooping down from the treetops towards them.
 A set of unnervingly sharp-looking claws the size of short curvy blades
 extended from its feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get down you muttering fool!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and thrust herself on Theo, bringing him down even as Ned shot
 his crossbow reflexively.
 Ned's shot missed wildly, unlike Parcifal.
 Timing her thrust, Encelados met with the creature's belly as it tried
 to leap upwards again, to hide in the lush canopy or have another go at
 them at its leisure.
 That was no longer possible, as Parcifal's blade brought it down after
 a couple of yards thrashing, wailing its high-pitched death throes in anguish,
 blood gushing freely from a lengthy wound, the creature's ghastly innards
 freely exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal quickly walked over to the dying creature and stood above it as
 it lay there, dying meekly.
 Theo exclaimed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Jah be with us! That dragonkin-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea could not resist the urge; she slapped him hard across the face and
 told him as he stood in frozen disbelief:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's for being an idiot.
 You can thank me for saving your life later.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo tried to force his mouth to make audible sounds form into a semblance
 of speech, while Parcifal held Encelados shoulder high and said ceremoniously:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unto the abyssal chasm I comment thee, beast.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She swung Encelados down sharply and the creature's head came off its neck
 clean, like a slice of fruit.
 The pool of blood around its lifeless body was already beginning to clog,
 while the cut below the head was almost clean dry.
 Parcifal looked at her sister with a mischievous look, underlined by a
 gleeful grin:

Theo swallowed hard and managed to regain a measure of composure.
 He laid himself down near the creature, muttering mostly to himself:

The sisters exchanged terms and conditions loudly, fighting over first kill

 to no-one in particular:

If that thing was evil, and that sword of yours detects evil in all its

\begin_layout Standard
Theo chimed in morosely:

Because that dragonkin was Vulsek, my flying steed.
 He wasn't evil, just scared.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters heard that and paused to wonder even as Parsifal shot a look
 at Encelados.
 It was indeed glowing with dazzling ferocity.
 They exchanged knowing worried looks when suddenly Winceham burst forth
 from a patch of tall grass running with all the speed his stature and years
 allowed.
 He shouted something indelible to the others without turning around to
 look, and lost himself through another thick bush behind the crest of a
 ravine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What did he say? Something about a rat and a tip?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned as he fumbled with his crossbow, trying to reload it in a hurry,
 shooting worried glances at the wild grass in the meantime.

The bunny then popped up in front of him from underground, and started running
 around in circles, the flames from its eyes whirling in a blinding fashion.

Bo looks excited about something.
 Maybe Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and then suddenly a trio of bipedal mushrooms holding iron spears
 and using their tops as shields came out of the thick grass running awkwardly,
 exchanging long-winded moaning sounds and pointing at Theo and the rest
 aggressively, if one were to judge by the way the spears faced towards
 the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure Winceham has a thing for mushrooms,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Lernea and let the string of her bow sing sharply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd say he's more into greens, I assure you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a shake of her head and rushed the warrior-mushrooms
 head on, whirling Encelados with wild abandon.
 Ned was looking at the scene in front of him as if it were only a dream;
 he had a sudden epiphany then and told Theo who was waving his hands about
 him in a ridiculously complicated manner in what seemed to be preparation
 for a spell:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Did you hear the joke about the fungus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

No, what joke?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could tell you now, but it might need time to grow on you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and grinned while Theo stood pondering as his hands filled with
 a shiny, blue ball of crackling energy.
 Ned let a bolt fly straight through the mouth of a raging mushroom-warrior
 which plucked half its head off and brought it down with a flop.
 Lernea was reloading her bow after her first arrow got stuck on a mushroom
 cap, and Parcifal poised Encelados for yet another slash at the wild mushroom-m
an directly in front of her, expertly avoiding its thrusts and hacking it
 to death; it was a matter of few strokes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo suddenly shook with hearty laughter as the joke struck home, and at
 the same time hurtled a ball of lightning at a mushroom charging Lernea,
 its spurious gait almost laughable.
 The mushroom promptly exploded into a cloud of charred dust with fleshy
 bits of what used to form its torso flying around.
 The smell of burning fungi permeated the air.
 Parcifal made sure Encelados wasn't glowing any more before saying triumphantly
:
\end_layout

Such is the way Encelados pierces through the shadow of evil!

Lernea sounded demoralized, distraught even:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not fair! Even Ned killed one!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned ignored the comment on his abilities as a marksman and walked over the
 body of his kill, looking for his bolt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo sounded deliriously giggly, barely able to make sense when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

See, I get that! Fungi grow, and so will the joke, which is to say, already

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled thinly but pretty soon the smile vanished when Bo the Bunny reemerged
 in front of him and afforded him an uncannily wide smile.
 Ned had another flash of mind and asked everyone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is Winceham?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the bunny knew that Winceham was still running through brush and wood,
 over bog and marsh, muttering incoherently:

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal had apologized to Theo, but he still looked downcast and moody;
 he kept Bo the Bunny by his side always.
 Curiously enough, the usually rampant bunny obliged him.
 It was as if the animal could sense Theo's loss and sympathized; which
 wasn't the weirdest thing considering it was a bunny with flames writhing
 out of its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea and Ned had found Winceham inside a pool of slimy bog water, drenched
 in muck.
 They had a hard time convincing him that the mushroom warriors were real
 enough to end up dead.
 Winceham had told them he'd definitely quit when all this debacle was over;
 he felt had to clarify that he didn't mean that he'd quit the group.
 After exchanging a few puzzled looks, they were back on the trail that
 led to Theo's village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crack of dawn was upon them; they were tired and hungry, but they pressed
 on when Theo told them they were almost there.
 Through a clearing up ahead, they could suddenly see thick plumes of smoke
 rise up into the sky behind the last crest they had to pass in order to
 reach the village.
 Theo smiled brightly for the first time since his steed had been slain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh! They must be preparing a feast! That's never happened before!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The others exchanged knowing looks; that smoke was of an entirely different
 scale.
 Clouds of smoke that size usually meant that in the very unlikely event
 of a feast, something had gone terribly wrong.
 They hadn't the heart to tell Theo; he'd soon find out.
 Ned almost growled, his anger starting to boil his blood once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hobb.
 Hobb must've done this.
 Damn his name and soul.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham, who had mostly dried up by then, sighed and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This changes things for the worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while the sisters looked at the smoke with heavy, sombre frowns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If this really is Hobb's doing, it's no longer a matter of debt, pride,

 This is the work of evil; it must be cleansed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal and Lernea agreed with a nod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skrala, we swear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and carried onwards, beside Theo, his reality distorted by his
 naive, though well-mannered demeanor.
 Lernea looked at him with pity; his eyes met hers and his smile made her
 avert her gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo asked her and stopped as they had began to slowly climb the last hill.
 The others passed them by in silence on their way to the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was reminded of my home, suddenly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and found a reassuring core of truth to her words.
 An icy feeling of loneliness crept up on her; the terrible image of Nomos
 burning in her mind made her shudder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you cold, or maybe sick?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo disarmingly.
 He looked genuinely worried.
 Lernea held a tear with some effort and told him while she gently pushed
 him up the slope:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 That's all, Theo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She shook her head and smiled thinly, as they walked the last few feet to
 the top in silence.
 The others were already there, casting long, nimble shadows on the foliage.
 The sun had barely lifted itself above the lush green carpet of treetops,
 yet a warm light embraced their faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About Vulsek? It was an accident,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said without conviction.
 He was still trying to come to grips with that.
 When they reached the top, what was left of the village below was painfully
 in plain sight, fires still consuming small tree-houses, sheds and trees
 alike.
 Theo's jaw dropped in an instant, with Bo always by his side, the flames
 in his eyes dying down suddenly.
 Lernea touched Theo's hand gently and told him in an almost broken voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry about your village.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words failed him.
 He sank to his knees and fell on the ground, as if the last iota of strength
 had left him.
 Winceham awkwardly put a hand around his shoulder and said nothing.
 Ned looked with mounting anger at the burning village, his eyes wandering
 aimlessly as if trying to comprehend something illogical; the crackle of
 fire reached them with ominous clarity.
 Trees had burned down to a crispy cinder, leaving nothing but ashes and
 smoldering stumps behind them.
 Wooden tree-bridges laid in ruins, half-eaten by the flames, the houses
 at the top of the trees burning away like huge candles, burning flakes
 wafting in the air like a fiery snowfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun came up, its first rays lost in the glow of the fires.
 It was an unruly sight, but no-one looked away; each one of them was lost
 in their own thoughts.
 Theo finally broke down in tears, and a tender sob took over him.
 Bo turned his head to Theo and wrinkled his nose; his whiskers twitched
 and his eyes lit up with a subdued flame before he ran down the hill, stopped
 and turned to look straight at Ned.
 He hopped a couple of times before running down the hillside, towards the
 village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He wants us to follow him.
 Could he have smelled something?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and set out after the bunny.
 Parcifal shrugged a little and followed close by, while Winceham told Theo
 with a gentle voice down to a whisper:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll get him laddie.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo managed to stem the tears and said flatly, his eyes lost somewhere
 beyond the burning trees:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No evil deed goes unpunished, Theo,

 Winceham shot her a troubled look and said:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

To which she replied sternly:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo staggered at first, then wiped his eyes with his robe, stifling another
 sob as they slowly walked downhill.
 The fire was still slowly consuming everything it touched, but it had mostly
 died down where it had met the rather soggy, dense forest around the grove
 where the village had once stood.
 What was left of it, was burning slowly like candle wax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny was standing on a well at the village's entrance.
 It was hopping and bouncing around like driven suddenly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bo's found someone!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Theo and ran to the well.
 Parcifal was looking at the edge of the village warily; she could not escape
 a feeling of danger.
 Winceham hunched low and put his senses to good use, while Lernea asked
 Ned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Could Hobb have done this? Burned down a whole village? Why would he do
 that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

I'm not sure.

 said Ned with a puzzled, worried frown.
 Lernea looked around and said knowingly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are no bodies.
 There's no smell of charred flesh either.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham turned around and told them, rubbing his fingers full of dirt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's because they took everyone.
 At least two dozen strong, deep tracks all over the place.
 Heavy armor probably.
 There are no traces of a fight; there's a strange, faint smell of iron
 though.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not everyone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo as he helped an elder-looking woodkin climb out of the well.
 His plain robes were smudged and stained with soot, his face was dark.
 Grizzly long dreadlocks adorned his head, where a wooden circlet sat.
 The Elder smiled copiously as he sat down on the ground, obviously exhausted.

Parcifal shot the woodkin a suspicious look, her eyes going back and forth
 between the elder and Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked, clutching Encelados' hilt nervously.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo with a furrowed brow as he helped Fingammon to his flask of
 water.
 The Elder waved the flask away and looked at Parcifal in the eyes.
 His voice had a strange, gravely quality.
 It was hoarse and he talked in a drawn out, strangely exotic way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She looked at the dark-skinned elder woodkin as if measuring him for a moment.
 She then seemed content, and relaxed a bit.
 Still, she kept a wary look for anything out of the ordinary, whatever
 her definition of ordinary was for a burning village.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where is everyone? What happened?

 asked Theo with an urgent, choked voice.
 Lernea also looked at the elder with a curious gaze.
 She asked him:

How come you're not dead or missing like the others?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Winceham was still searching for tracks, when Ned placed a hand on Lernea
 and asked the elder kindly:

Fingammon the elder looked at Ned and nodded slowly.
 He spoke then, the strain on his voice bearing witness to his ordeal:

 he said and looked at Theo with a longing to be believed.
 The others didn't speak but Parcifal scoffed, and Ned folded his arms on
 his chest apprehensively.
 Lernea was now staring at the woodkin with a frown.
\end_layout

'Tis true, I know it be crazy, but 'tis true like dem fires.

 The woodkin spoke then:

 he said with an awed, humble voice and a hand that wove shapes in the air,
 trying to paint them a life-like picture.
 Parcifal shook her head and sheathed Encelados.
 She put her hands on her waist:

Winceham looked at her from where he was sitting crouched a few feet away.
 He didn't share her opinion:

There are strange things in this world.

 Parcifal took that comment as an insult and replied accordingly:

My sister and I are scions bred to rule, halfuin.

 Instead, her sister motioned with her hand for Parcifal to calm down.

 Winceham added:

The lad speaks the truth.
 Devious things, but their masters are the ones that control them, the ones

If they're made of iron, that would explain the strong scent I picked up.

 The crystal shone with iridescent colours and the girder was covered in
 a form of writing none had ever witnessed before, beautifully flowing and
 masterfully thin.
 Theo couldn't help staring at it with a sudden rush of curiosity; he looked
 inexplicably drawn to it, somehow.

 Winceham stretched his legs and worked his joints.

Alright then.

 Ned and Theo, you're last,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Theo did not seem to question her one bit.
 As the woodkin stood upright, he told Lernea with a fatherly voice:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those words brought a grin on Ned's face, while Winceham rolled his eyes

 They all set out towards the Lake, leaving the village's ruins to smolder
 under an overcast sky.

You don't really believe that story, do you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 her sister asked in a hushed voice as Theo led the way, Fingammon wearily
 trudging along by his side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Bo popped up from beneath the ground, right in front of her feet.
 He looked at her with eyes glowing hot as embers, before grinning widely
 directly at her and burrowing itself down again.
 A moment later it popped up right behind Theo, and followed him close by,
 happily hopping around him playfully, the flames around his eyes twirling
 like a torch at night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal answered her own question before Lernea could answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Never mind that.
 I guess a flying ship's not that weird,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and fell in line, Ned and Winceham close behind them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clouds were gathering.
 It was a hazy morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Part Three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was on watch, sitting at a ledge at the mouth of the cave.
 He hadn't really slept all that well; the physical exertion made his muscles
 ache but his troubled mind couldn't rest, and so he fidgeted nervously,
 never really getting a proper rest.
 Dark thoughts wrestled in his mind, and the need for revenge made his stomach
 churn and his heart thump mightily in his chest.
 He looked at the cloudy sky from the lip of the cave, his fingers gently
 caressing his drum, his sole possession in the world now and the last thing
 he loved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo couldn't sleep either; the realisation that almost his whole life he
 had been lied to, even if it seemed to be in everyone's best interest,
 was impossible to fathom.
 A lot of things were impossible for Theo to fathom actually, but this one
 in particular stung him like bees from hell.
 To top it off, there was no-one of his people to talk to about other than
 the elder, who having fully explained to him how he came to find him one
 day in the wounds, he fell asleep, the years on his back and the exhaustion
 from the ordeal with Hobb's raid having exerted their toll on the aged
 woodkin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo kept to himself, never uttering a word.
 He sat with his legs crossed, his eyes unable to part with the vista of
 his village burned to the ground.
 Little clouds of smoke still gathered above it, but the fires had been
 extinguished by that time, after having eating almost everything, leaving
 little for the eye to see that at one time, people had lived there.
 All that remained, was old Fingammon, sleeping in the cave deeply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned watched Theo absentmindedly, himself lost in thought.
 He had a sudden realisation then: if it wasn't for the ears and the bunny,
 it felt to him that he was watching himself.
 They had both lost their homes, and Theo had never met his parents; in
 a way, that was worse than what Ned was going through.
 At least he had some memories.
 But Theo, thought Ned, all he had to cry for was a bunny with a condition
 and an amulet that had only caused him disaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not easy, is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, speaking from the heart.
 Theo did not look at him, but simply remained silent, gazing outwards into
 the sky.
 Ned walked over him, and sat himself down on the bedrock beside Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My father was murdered last night,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said.
 The words spurred something in Theo.
 He looked thoughtful when he said softly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry for your loss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned nodded and spent a moment or so watching Theo in silence.
 The bunny was with him always it seemed.
 Just holding Bo seemed to be more than important to Theo.
 The flames on Bo's eyes were a mere prickle of light at that time; he looked
 content, nibbling a thick wide leaf.
 It kept looking at Theo as if he knew things were hard for him.
 Ned thought it wasn't impossible for a flame-eyed rabbit to know such things.
 It didn't take an expert in magical beasts to realise it when Bo looked
 at them funny.
 This was one such time.
 Theo noticed the look Bo shot Ned, ears pointed eagerly upright, the prickles
 of light in its eyes brightening up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down Bo.
 He's not bad.
 The bad men are out there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo with a grittiness that his youthful, woodkin appearance belied.
 Ned spoke to him earnestly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know what you're feeling right now.
 That would be a lie.
 But you haven't slept, and I couldn't do that either.
 I don't know if it's normal.
 But I'm not feeling tired.
 Sure, the legs hurt a bit, and my stomach's growling, but that's not the
 real pain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned let his words trail off awkwardly, remembering what had happened just
 the night before.
 He suppressed a tear and feeling somewhat embarrassed, looked the other
 way.
 They sat in relative silence for a few moments, interrupted by the far-away
 chirping of birds and Winceham's occasional saw-like snore.
 Theo broke the silence then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What was your father like?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's face contorted with a pained frown while he tried to find the words.
 He tried to put on a slightly sly smile and said:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's brow furrowed but not unkindly; it was simply the fact that Theo couldn't
 fail to surprise him every turn of the way.
 Being around him made everything normal acquire an interesting flair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right.
 Well, it wasn't that I was that bright, mind you; it's just that we burned
 her body.
 The plague, they said.
 I couldn't speak to her before she passed, for fear I'd catch what she
 had,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and looked at his feet for a while before adding, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think her last words I remember were `Go on, Ned.
 Be a good boy and help you father'
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo had an understanding look in his bright, green eyes.
 He pouted his lips slightly and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That sounds..
 Well, awful.
 At least, I never knew my real parents.
 I knew there was something funny about the skin color of everyone else,

 I never thought I was...
 Found,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he swallowed hard and let his voice trail off, his head lowered
 moodily.
 A smile crept up on Ned's face.
 Theo's naivety was bordering on stupidity as Parcifal would have it, but
 in his mind, Ned saw a child in a man's body, and that somehow reminded
 him of himself once more.
 Strangely, he felt that didn't bother him at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, we'll get your people back.

 He looked at Theo with a gleaming eye and went on:

 The bunny smiled back uncannily for only Theo to see.
 Ned replied truthfully:

No, not really.
 But this is what I have to do.

Theo spoke, his words carrying a touch of bitter sweetness:

 Theo looked at him with a wide, gentle smile, accented by the way its edges
 led to his long, pointy ears:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I may not have learned much, but I learned that fate is just what binds

Ned raised an eyebrow and seemed to give the notion some thought; he somehow
 felt lighter alongside the woodkin, as if he could lift his spirits.

If you put it like that, I have no regrets of a fate alongside you, Theo.

 simply being modest.

 He felt a bit proud, and a bit taller suddenly.

Now that you mention that, it brought to mind that joke of yours.

 Ned looked excited, and that carried on to the volume of his voice when
 he almost shouted:

 Theo nodded in silent affirmation and Bo raised his head alarmingly.
 Ned went on:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I know it's a little hard to play most omens, prophecies and tales with
 just a beating drum, but I believe it has great potential.
 Maybe if more bards got together and everyone played a different instrument,
 I could be, you know, supporting their music with beating the drum.
 And then we could tour, get the crowd rolling.
 It could be amazing,

 said Ned with childish excitement overrunning his voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't want to put you off, but that sounds all wrong.
 I mean, who would want to see the same bards over and over again? And everyone
 singing at the same time? Think of the cacophony.
 Come to think of it, how do you play notes on that thing? I don't see any
 keys, strings or pipes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo without thinking about it at all.
 His disarmingly blunt honesty fired Ned up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't have notes! It does have tone values though! And it needs tuning

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Ned with a sudden pang of mild anger.
 The bunny's eyes produced a burst of flames as Bo turned and looked at
 him with a twitchy nose.
 Theo simply spoke his mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm just saying, it would be better to stick to the jokes for now.

Ned thought about that for a while.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A team of bards? It's not a race, or a game.
 It's art; it will be a band of bards.

Theo shook his head with a frown.

I don't think that would work.

Oh, well.

And then they heard a loud sound like a squawk echo from the inside of the

 Bo's eyes flared up when the sound turned into a growl.
 They exchanged worried looks and were almost ready to do something stupid

Mr.

More advice, Wince? It doesn't always work, I'm afraid,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and didn't bother to look at the halfuin.
 Winceham realised Ned was probably still blaming mostly him for what happened
 at the Sniggering Pig.
 He'd try and talk it out of him, if he didn't know Ned all too well.
 He simply changed the subject:

Any sign of them yet? Where's the bleedin' sun when you need it? What time
 is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked and his eyes froze when he saw the bunny turn his head around
 at an impossible angle, grin at him and hold up a flaming hourglass with
 his hind legs, writhing with molten fire.
 It showed the day was well into the afternoon.

\begin_layout Standard

 said Theo, looking at the clouds as if he could make out the sun behind

 No-one but Winceham had noticed Bo's antics, or if they had, they didn't
 look surprised.
 Winceham thought as much and asked flatly:

 Theo stared for a moment and nodded fervently:

Parcifal was fidgeting uncomfortably inside their make-shift, make-believe

 Parcifal simply spoke them aloud instead of holding them within:

Ned was busy searching for the men who had disembarked from the flying ship.
 He had seen a couple of them, along with an ape-man, and what must've been
 the Hound Fingammon had heard mention of.
 Still, as they waded through the bush, approaching Hobb's search party
 with care, he once more explained to the noble princess why she and her
 sister, the Queen by right, were wearing a large bear-skin covering up
 their gear, pretending to be a two-headed freak:
\end_layout

It's the gear.

 Lernea talked with an impossibly sticky voice reminiscent of what dying

No other place to stick him, sorry.

I get better ideas when nature calls,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal as she tried to walk in step with the others occupying the
 same skin, meeting with stumbling success.
 Winceham's voice came muffled from under the bearskin, and in direct opposition
 to the sisters on either side of him, sounded positively delighted with
 Ned's idea about diversionary tactics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't see a bloody thing in front of me, but I know where to put me hands

 Lernea protested:
\end_layout

That was a sexual innuendo if I've ever heard one! Shameful, Mr.

 Parcifal exchanged a look with her sister and put her boot down hard on
 Winceham's right foot, while Lernea caught his left arm and dragged him
 along while he hopped on one foot.

Hanultheofodor, though Hanul or Theo will do just fine,

I'm sorry, but by monsters in that context, I was referring to the water

The Hound,

 he said with a feeling of awe and mounting anger as his eyes could not
 peel away from the three-headed canine, abnormally large, its skin sleek-black
 like the darkest of nights.
 A hundred feet or so behind the pirate search party, the silhouette of
 the ship bobbed lazily in the air, nearly the same height as the treetops.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alright,

 said Ned with conviction.

\begin_layout Standard

 the taught bearskin that covered all three of them like an over-sized coat.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Try to clap along the sound of my beat.
 When I stop the drumming and singing, have a go at them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned and started off with a drum roll, his red drum strapped in place
 in front of him, his tinglewood sticks a gift from his father.
 His voice echoed merrily as he sung at the top of his lungs, alongside
 the perky beat of his drum:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
And it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's men heard them before they could see them.
 One of the Hound's head's sniffed the air vigorously, while another turned
 and looked sideways at Ned and the others as they tried to dance about
 to the tune, the sisters and Winceham having a real problem standing upright
 while their dance looked more like a drunken balancing act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ape-men grinned broadly at the spectacle, while the buccaneers had the
 uneasy expression of someone meeting an odd, crazy-looking person on his
 doorstep asking to use the facilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned kept at the song as they got closer at a walking pace, and Theo performed
 a sort of light show, sprinkling shiny dust in the air.
 Even Bo added his flaming eyes to the performance, hopping eagerly.

Ned exchanged looks sideways with Theo.
 The ape-men where clapping their hands and jiggling their heads in tune
 with the beat of Ned's drum, while the buccaneer men pointed a couple of
 fingers and shot some ugly stares at the two-headed freak.
 They were in fact arguing whether or not the six-legged weirdo was supposed
 to be the dancing lead, seeing that the drummer and the clown were busy
 with their own act.
 Perhaps not surprisingly, the Hound had its six eyes all set on Bo; the
 beast looked tense, its lean muscles taut on edge.
 They were now no more than ten yards away, and Ned was banging away a joyous
 beat, his voice like hearty laughter through the air:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
The two-headed freak, the sisters and Winceham in disguise really, tried
 to clap its hands together on tune but rarely managed to do so.
 It rather seemed to punch its belly vigorously, both heads smiling brightly
 as it did so.
 Winceham's muffled agony at the hands of the sisters was obfuscated by
 Ned's singing and drum act, while Theo's cantrips had even attracted the
 gaze of the wary buccaneers who were tapping their boots in tune as well.
 The ape-men had put down their blunderbusses and were dancing, arm-in-arm,
 in a rather hairy, unpleasing sight.
 The Hound though kept trained at Bo who was happily doing somersaults in
 the air; a flaming rainbow of orange light trailed his eyes.
 Ned and the rest entered into a circle around the group of Hobb's men,
 and into the final verse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I'm sick in the head and I haven't gone to bed

\begin_layout Standard
Ned' voice trailed off and he ventured a somewhat nervous look at Theo.
 The ape-men staggered as the banging of the drum stopped, and one of the
 buccaneers asked showing a set of teeth that looked like a puzzle badly
 missing most of its pieces:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 came Winceham's muffled cry from within the belly of the two-headed freak

The sisters shed the bearskin in one fluid motion, revealing their armor
 and weapons underneath with Winceham in the middle, holding a rather pointy
 dagger in one hand and sporting a wild-eyed grin.
 Theo side-stepped Ned and passed him the crossbow he kept tucked under
 his robes.
 Hobb's men were fiddling with the flintlocks on their guns, gnarled looks
 of surprise on their weather-torn faces; their dropped jaws denoted dental
 hygiene was probably a pirate's worst fear.
 One of the ape-men had time enough to ask their pirate handlers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is this part o' the troupe's act?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before the brighter of the two had the chance to explain, Ned's bolt had
 buried itself in his head.
 The other ape-man looked at Ned with a cocked eyebrow and complained even
 as his hand reached for the cutlass at his cloth belt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's not entertaining, at all.

How's this then!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Winceham and with a jolt and a rolling tumble right beside the
 pirates, reached under the large ape as he was about to have a go at Ned
 and Theo.
 Winceham gave the ape-man a quick stab in one leg; blood spurted and the
 large brute growled in pain as his animal self took over.
 The pirates were only a pace away from the sisters; free of the constraining
 bearskin, they truly seemed to dance to an inner beat.
 The pirates' blunderbusses let off their leaden shots from point-blank
 range with a thundering boom and a plume of smoke and sparks.

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters were nowhere to be seen.

Oy, these 'basses work bettah when loaded with sumetin', eh?

 said Mr.

 When he gave him a look though, he became morbidly aware that the man's
 head had been chopped off clean.
 A few feet away stood Parcifal wielding Encelados in her hand, grinning
 at the pirate broadly.
 A few feet behind him, Lernea showed off her skills with the bow.

 she cried and let loose a fistful of arrows headed for the ape-man from
 a distance a blind man would rarely miss.
 Sadly though, they zipped by harmlessly and the growling ape charged at
 Theo with his cutlass swinging down from way up high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do something Theo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Ned as he struggled to reload his crossbow, his drum getting in the
 way.
 It was all happening in fractions of a moment; Theo laid there helpless,
 his hands unable to produce anything other than a trembling motion.
 His senses had nothing good in stock for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was trying to nock another arrow, and Parcifal was exchanging blows
 with the remaining pirate.
 He could hear Winceham cursing as he rushed behind the ape once more, but
 he was far too slow.
 And Bo..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Where is Bo?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought flashed in Theo's mind as he lay there practically paralyzed.
 His vision then filled with the image of a white fluffy rabbit smiling
 at him in an uncanny human fashion; Bo leapt in the air, swung his head
 around, and shot a pair of small fireballs at the charging ape, who was
 instantly engulfed in flames.
 His body came down crashing, writhing in flames, while Theo saw the Hound
 hurtle past him, ignoring him completely as it was after Bo at a running
 pace that its size belied.
 Its three heads shot cones of fire, lightning and acid as it ran after
 Bo, charring the ground, making plant life in its path fizz away into goo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo shouted 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 with pained affection and worry and ran after the hound heedless of the
 danger.
 Winceham stuck his dagger into the charred remains of the ape-man with
 a wild cheer, while Encelados' clangs came to an end when Parcifal expertly
 nicked his cutlass away from him and brought her blade against his bare
 neck.

 said Lernea and her bow shuddered as an arrow flew away.
 It struck the Hound at one of its necks, and caused it to give pause to
 the chase.
 The head where the arrow had struck soon fell limp as it died - the other
 two ventured to pierce the very clouds with their howls and growls.
 The hound turned about and charged straight at Lernea.
 Running past a bewildered Theo, the Hound swerved around one of Ned's bolts
 and shot him a glancing shot of deadly acid breath.
 Fortunately his drum got in the way, and promptly began to melt away.

 cried Lernea to Parcifal as she nocked a second arrow in her bow.
 The Hound was closing in damnably fast; a shot of acid went wide of its
 mark, while a bolt of lightning knocked Winceham off his feet and threw
 him down with a thud that didn't match the halfuin's size.
 Ned was reloading his crossbow, while Theo was still running after Bo,
 nearly lost behind some trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the hound's heads growled ferociously and prepared to leap at Lernea,
 only a few yards separated them.
 It was Parcifal who slided on her knees suddenly in front of the hound,
 hunched behind the family shield, Erymanthos.
 The Hound clashed on the shield with all its might and a terrible raucous;
 Parcifal was knocked away wildly, while the Hound bucked and leapt on the
 air without any control, rolling haplessly.
 As it fell down on the earth only a few feet away from Lernea, it was still
 trying to stand on its feet when two arrows struck true right between its
 heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without so much as a squeak, it passed away.
 It's death cry was replaced by a cannon shot like thunderclap flaring hot
 as it flew right above everyone's heads; the red-hot cannonball cut down
 a swath of trees with a pompous thud and a loud mass of creaking noises.
 Winceham mumbled obscenities between deep moaning sounds while Ned caught
 a man reloading a cannon from the corner of his eye.
 He turned around and looked; it was Culliper.
 Ned overflowed with rage suddenly:

\begin_layout Standard

 Lernea nodded and picked up the shield as she went.

The cannon on the prow of the ship was manned by Culliper alone.
 With the element of surprise gone, he yelled menacingly:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then fired both his pistols, one aimed at Ned and the other at Lernea.
 Ned was running with the speed and grace of the wind; Culliper simply was
 too slow to aim and the bullet meant for Ned zipped past him, blowing chunks
 of wet-wood out of a nearby tree.
 But the other bullet struck Lernea true with an ominous metal clang, and
 felled her to the ground.

 run towards the ship once more, her hair ruffled up.

 yelled Culliper with a fist and started reloading his pistols mumbling
 curses under his breath with a jittery voice.
 The smell of something burning drew his attention and then noticed the
 intensity of the smell.
 Combined with a burning sensation, it made him realise his hat was on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He threw it on the deck panicked, and stomped on it repeatedly.
 He then realised a bunny with flaming eyes was grinning at him, perched
 on top of a barrel of highly flammable grog.

Now lookit here, a bunny with flaming eyes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper cocked the flintlock but before he could pull the trigger, a fist
 connected sharply with his face and sent his head spinning and him staggering
 like a pirate with coin to spend.
 Before he had time to recover, another punch sent him sprawling on the
 deck.
 It was Ned, trembling with hate as the man who killed his father laid helpless
 before him, his pistols lying about far corners of the deck.
 He looked at him with a viciousness that marred his benign face:

No, Ned, wait! Don't!

 said Lernea as she climbed onto the deck.
 She still held Erymanthos, its upper lip torn and a large sunken hole prominent
 near the Nomos crest of the Holy Mountain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper looked at them with surprise and stubbornness mixed in equal parts.
 For a passing moment, Culliper thought about upstaging everyone with a
 feat of nimbleness and pick up his pistols, shooting the meddling pests
 dead.
 But his pragmatism and his basic cowardice overcame him.
 Laying on his back he begged for his life:

No, please! Listen to her...
 Ned! If I heard her right, that is.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

Ned picked up a loaded pistol nonetheless and aimed it squarely at Culliper.
 He then told Lernea with pain in his voice, the pistol in his hand trembling
 with frail determination:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me a really good reason not to pull this trigger, Queen of Nomos.
 I'd expect you'd understand.
 Or would you have me adhere to the sanctity of life, even the life of a
 maggot, like this one? Will this scar me for life? I'm already scarred,
 Lernea.
 Nothing good will come of this, you might say.
 I care for naught.
 It's him, and Hobb.
 This one pulled the trigger; Hobb was the one who sucked my father's life
 out of him.
 So tell me, good Queen, one good reason not to.

Lernea looked long and hard at Ned; her stare had a calming effect.
 She sighed and said carefully:

 of the way the others, and especially Winceham, stared at her sister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her efforts to reprimand Parcifal were for naught; she still munched away
 blissfully even after everyone had filled their bellies thoroughly.
 She had gathered a small cornucopia in front of her, including a leg of
 smoked ham, a head of almost-gone-bad cheese and all sorts of sweetbreads
 and sour pancakes, along with a bulging fruit-basket and an amphora of
 sweet red wine.
 The ship's galley had been recently stocked to the brim, as if in preparation
 for a long journey.

 Winceham counterpointed, waving a finger as he spoke:

Ned sighed.
 He knew Winceham tended to be overprotective, mostly of himself:

Halfuin skin is very sensitive; it could be months before I'm fit for action

 said Ned nodding at Culliper at the helm, and walked away towards the ship's
 bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham nodded and his gaze returned to the horizon.
 There was still nothing in sight that resembled Hobb's Keep or Chuck's
 Point, the northern cape's ridge where the keep stood.
 Below the ship, which was an otherwise unassuming, common pirate sloop
 that could nonetheless literally fly, a hazy tapestry of green passed them
 by in tranquility.
 To port, one could barely make out Hobb's Bay in the distance, while to
 starboard a sea of rolling jungle hills seemed to go on forever.
 And behind them, somewhere beyond the haze and the fog stood the remains
 of the woodkin village, where Fingammon prayed to Jah, waiting for his
 peoples' safe return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo kept a wary eye on Culliper who remained unequivocally silent, nursing
 the aching back of his head from time, shooting murderous stares at everyone
 once in a while.
 Everyone except Bo who stood watch high upon the mast.
 The bunny, for some reason known only to the two of them, made Culliper
 cringe and look away with a morose, even shameful expression.

Parcifal made it common knowledge that she felt full with a loud burp, followed

 asked Theo, who had left Culliper in the care of Bo.
 That roughly meant that Bo slept soundly while Culliper stood on the helm,
 rigid like stone, yet fretful like a virgin on her wedding night.

Lernea felt the woodkin was perhaps intruding, his question a bit too straightfo

 Parcifal did not seem to share in that thought and said with a playful
 grin, her brow raised:

 It was evident in his voice that the thought of time stopping and perhaps

 Everyone turned their heads to have a look-see while the neck of the ridge
 kept growing taller.
 Even Mr.
 Jessums moved his dead-like stare a bit, still strapped down on the strange-loo
king contraption on the lower part of the deck that resembled a chair.
 Arguably, it was a most sinister chair that according to Culliper, sucked
 the life force of its occupant in order for the ship to fly.
 Winceham had called the premise `a hay bag full of excrement' but his own
 personal experience of sitting on it caused him to squirm away at the sight
 of it the moment they managed to pull him off.

 At the very tip of the cape, it was a huge oblong stone and brick construct,
 it's wide walls situated to cover with their cannon and balistae both Hobb's

 It rose formidably above the clouds.
 Ned waved everyone close and they huddled together in a rough circle:

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and flexed his fingers.
 Everyone else readied their weapons as well and hunched low to the sides
 of the ship.
 At the tower, an elevated wooden platform stood out, acting as a dock.
 It was supported on a wheeled scaffold which sported some kind of pulley
 arrangement.
 The whole dock seemed able to move, elevate and rotate with the help of
 some ropes and weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lookout had seen the ship approach; he was standing on the platform scratching
 his head.
 He rearranged his hat and squinted his eyes.
 A scruffy-looking dog was barking non-stop.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ahoy there! What took yer so long? Why's everyone shy? Jessums? Is Scubbs
 acting like the fool again? It ain't no ghost ship this time, I can tell!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled the pirate and fell into a death-defying giggle that involved clearing
 up one's lungs and nose cavities thoroughly.
 He spat a greenish globule, the color of grog and the consistency of glue.
 Even the dog cared enough to move, flee-bitten and ridden with lice as
 it was.
 No answer came and Ned simply let the ship slide effortlessly sideways,
 the platform grazing the hull slightly:

Och! Watch the paint, you dumb rum-sacked lolly-gagging halakazoo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A rope seemed to shoot off itself down to the tower and Ned appeared suddenly
 and stepped on the platform, his crossbow in hand, aimed squarely at the
 pirate.
 Lernea followed suit and nocked an arrow in her bow, while Parcifal simply
 unsheathed Encelados.
 The pirate was superbly equipped to deal with the situation at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oy, I yield,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said in a flat monotone and raised his arms, while the dog beside him

 had ever produced.

 replied Parcifal while Lernea eased her bow only slightly and followed
 her sister to an open staircase that led below.

Winceham felt it was high time he asked someone before everyone was caught
 up in doing something serious:

Seemingly out of nowhere, a burst of flame ignited the pipe in his hand

 Winceham turned around and saw Bo peeking out of Theo's robes, grinning

Winceham and Ned had been silently climbing down the many stories of the
 keep.
 Winceham could be perfectly silent when he needed to; he scouted ahead
 and made sure the way was clear before Ned followed in his steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was for the most part, an easy way in.
 There wasn't such a thing as patrols, but rather bands of merry pirates
 with a lot of time on their hands and little to do other than participate
 in pissing and drinking contests, though not necessarily in that exact
 order.
 A few rooms had pirates in the guise of guards posted outside who instead
 of actually guarding them, played craps, cards, and other gambling games,
 usually with very lopsided results that ended in sharp instruments being
 used to clarify things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, Winceham listened, watched and waited, before Ned followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They hadn't ran onto anything especially interesting or dangerous; there
 was a vague hope the woodkin would be held in the dungeons deep below,
 but other than that the complete lack of noisy conundrums above meant that
 the sisters were either brilliantly successful in their task, or in grave
 danger.
 Winceham expressed that belief with a whisper, and Ned replied with almost
 a hiss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Maybe they're waiting.

For what? Dinnertime?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Winceham, his face screwed up in anger.
 He was about to take another step forward and lead them another floor down
 when he heard a duo of pirates conversing casually as they came down a
 corridor to meet the staircase:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oy, how do we go about that then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said one, scratching his head under his hat, evidently befuddled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, I suppose we ditch them in the pit and let the crocs do the rest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied the other with a shrug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, you see I was wondering, how do we push them inside the pit.
 I mean, there's like more than just two of them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 insisted the somewhat not-so-bright-as-his colleague pirate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Boyo, you're right! How 'bout we kill'em first so they don't move about

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the other with mock surprise and excitement which did not carry over
 as intended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Dunno 'bout that, boss said feed them to crocs alive or it spoils their

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 came the wavering answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he won't know the difference know, will he?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the other with a mischievous grin that could've been sparkling had
 more teeth been available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham nodded to Ned and then casually appeared in front of them from
 behind the staircase wall:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it with you pirates and dental hygiene?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked with a cocky grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it one of them? What's it doin' down 'ere?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the pirate uneasily, while the other turned and replied with a frown
 of uncertainty:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, too short, not blue enough.
 Oy, boyo, stick'em!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the pirate and brandished a cutlass.
 To his surprise though, Winceham wasn't standing where he was supposed
 to be.
 Instead, the pirate now faced Ned's crossbow, and his rather dull partner
 had a stiletto sticking out of his gut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin, if you please?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and waved his bloodied stiletto menacingly.
 Ned kept the crossbow trained at the now glum-looking pirate, who had to
 ask:

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The pirate still didn't seem to cooperate.

That's going too far even for the likes of you, sirrah,

 said Winceham with a snarl and felt a sudden urge to stab the pirate vehemently.
 Ned stayed his arm and asked the pirate:

 asked Winceham urgently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Who?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked the pirate with an ever more frightened, bewildered voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Please, Ned.
 Let me,

 said Winceham, his voice trembling from aggravation, an ill-tempered gleam
 in his eye, the stiletto swinging in his hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The jungle folk.
 Where are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned as calmly as possible.

Oh, them you mean? Off-world with the last shipment!

Off-world?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Then they heard a cry echo down the walls.
 And then another.
 They were high-pitched and sounded familiar.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A woman's cries,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham under his breath and instinctively looked up, from where
 the sound came.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The sisters!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 yelled Ned and ran up the staircase as if the world was about to end.

Winceham told the pirate:
\end_layout

Duck.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked the pirate with a screwed up face, unable to understand.
 Winceham sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never mind, too tall anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and tripped the pirate, sending him careening down the stairs.
 Sounds of broken bones and muffled cries echoed, while Winceham ran up
 the staircase as fast as any halfuin could.

They ran up the stairs and down corridors meeting little resistance.
 A couple of unlucky pirates who wanted to see what the commotion of running
 feet was all about, met a deadly, painful fate in the form of a bolt between
 the eyes and a stiletto in the nether regions.
 Not so silent but rather deadly, Ned and Winceham searched for the sisters,
 like a wild swirling dervish would dance about a desert of stone.
 The keep was almost empty, it suddenly occurred to them.
 And the sisters were nowhere to be found, or seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until they heard a different voice, in a very different way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The top of the tower, if you please.

Did you hear that?

 asked Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm trying to quit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He then realised that Ned had heard it as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Top of the tower?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham to make sure they were hearing the same voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Speaking in our minds? What devilry is this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned in disbelief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm not sure, but it could be a trap,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham nodding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What choice is there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a shrug.
 Winceham added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

True, but I felt compelled to say that, just to make my point when things
 go horribly wrong.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned placed a hand on Winceham's good shoulder and told him with ardor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hurry, Wince.
 Be on your toes; try to hide yourself in the shadows up there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Believe me when I say that would have been my first choice as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them ran up the tower expecting some kind of surprise on the
 way, but nothing obstructed them.
 Soon, they emerged at the tower's top, the night sky glistening with starlight,
 the clouds below a soft, tempting, milky white mattress.
 They noticed alarmingly that the ship was missing, along with any signs
 of Theo and Bo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What really caught their eye though, was the way the sisters stood, not
 far away from the tower's edge right in front of the staircase.
 They were frozen like statues, the intensity of their plight drawn on their
 living faces.
 They looked as if a last, stilted breathe remained in them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood with Encelados blaring white hot above her head, both hands
 on the hilt, her face scrounged up in a mix of terror and hate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was right beside her, calm like the sea, determined and unyielding
 as she was about to let an arrow fly; yet the bow's string remained taut,
 and Lernea stood there as if petrified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right behind the sisters stood an extremely tall, lavishly robed man with
 a beard, ruffled hair and a sharp, too sharp too be real, icy blue gleam
 on his eyes.
 Winceham tried to meld into the shadows, taking small back-steps to the
 nearest ledge of the tower, his hood over his head.
 The bearded man spoke then with a rolling, deep voice that sounded like
 stony reeds alongside a foaming river:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Now, now, Mr.

Hobb,

 stated Ned coldly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, yes.
 Among others,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the man, the torch in his hand casting wild, creepy shadows of the
 two sisters as he silently and uncannily walked between them.
 Winceham noticed an unsettling thing about him: He wasn't actually walking;
 he was gliding a couple of inches above the stone floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hold you responsible for my father's death,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and glared at him, heedless of how peculiar the man's voice and
 looks were, apart from the fact he was levitating.
 Hobb came to a stop a few yards away and smiled thinly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Weird things, humans.
 You blame me for your father's death, while Culliper pulled that trigger.
 Still, you couldn't kill him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How do you know that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned with uneasy suspicion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I know many things.
 But what I crave right now is one: the amulet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's voice had a deadly finality to it.
 It took great composure and strength of character for a man to simply talk
 with that man around, yet Ned found in him the audacity to talk back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not a jeweler; you have the wrong person.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hobb's face suddenly got screwed up horribly and stretched impossibly.
 With another twist of its flesh and a growling, the human face was torn
 away, evaporating instantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its place, an elongated head was now visible.
 Grey-blue skin shone slick in the starlight and a flock of stubby, short
 tentacles like anemones writhed around a circular, sharp-teethed maw.
 The hands had turned into webbed claws, sharp like scythes.
 Hobb, it turned out, was literally some kind of monster out of a nightmare.
 The creature that had disguised itself as Hobb looked at Ned with an irritated
 curiosity and blared ominously, its voice now grating:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't play coy with me! I know about your little escapades, and I've seen

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's a really ugly way to ask for things,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned, while he noticed Winceham stood silent and immobile as a rock.
 Ned realised he was suddenly a little bit outmatched but carried on, trying
 to understand the foe in front of him and think of what to do next, really
 really fast.
 The creature approached him with unnerving silence and stood hovering in
 the air a few feet away.
 Its blue-on-blue eyes had the colour of the deepest sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 replied the monster with a rumbling voice.

\begin_layout Standard

Yes, I see mopping really is beneath you,

 said Ned grinning, gesturing at the tentacled maw.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was hoping I did not have to feed tonight; your minds sicken me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the creature said and hissed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I could say the same thing about your face but that would be a compliment
 in your case,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ned, and saw Lernea's hand spasm ever so slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll have what is mine, Ned Larkin, and you'll have what you deserve!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the monster as he lunged forward with a gaping maw, aiming squarely
 for Ned's head, its powerful long arms springing to catch Ned in a deathly
 embrace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was right at that time that Lernea's arrow struck him in the back,
 causing it to turn around reflexively and growl, its maw tentacles writhing
 like the feet of a millipede.
 Ned slid away and ran towards the wheeled platform where the ship had docked.
 From the corner of his eye, he saw Lernea was trying to move and Parcifal's
 hands were trembling.
 Winceham too, could move his head again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will find great delight in sucking your skull dry, Larkin!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the creature as it hurled himself against Ned, its robes fluttering
 in the night breeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With your sense of humor, that's a no-brainer!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yelled Ned gleefully and saw Lernea, Parcifal and Winceham suddenly unfreeze
 completely.
 Without a second look at their surroundings, their weapons were being trained
 against the creature.
 Their angered shouts and brave cries rose into the night air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By Skarla, we'll have vengeance!

 yelled the sisters, and Winceham asked before rushing towards the blue-skinned
 terror:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ya think you're tall, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a wave of its hand and a low-keyed hum from its maw, all three of them
 were pushed back in the air.
 They landed hard on their backs, their weapons flying off their hands.
 The monster turned its attention squarely at Ned, before it added gleefully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where is the humor now, human?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The last word had the subtle hints of sounding exactly like a writhing mass

 Ned smiled coolly and retorted:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You just keep asking yourself, don't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The creature let out a terrible sound between an infuriated growl and a
 cacophonous gurgling laughter before it reached for Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right when there was nothing funny to joke about, right about when Ned could
 see the others were still trying to get up, too far away to act, he saw
 Bo, the bunny with the flaming eyes jump right in front of him.
 Bo grinned at Ned widely and hopped back out of view in a split second,
 right before a hot molten cannonball hit the monster square across the
 face and embedded what was left of him and his smoldering robes in the
 tower's stony floor, a few feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then saw the ship wobbling uncertainly, sails rippling with small gusts
 of wind.
 Theo hurried to man the helm, while the bow cannon cooled with a red after-glow
 on its lip.
 A thin wisp of smoke wafted westward, where the wind blew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned smiled broadly and sighed with relief, while Winceham yelled as he looked
 around him, waiting for confirmation:

Did ya see it? Did ya see the bunny?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters got up on their feet, nursing aching muscles and perhaps a couple
 of displaced bones.
 Lernea was about to say something to Winceham, but she lost her words when
 she saw a bright flash and an uncanny oval slit appear right above the
 tower floor in mid-air, at the place where the creature should have met
 its demise.

The slit made things look as if peering through a strange, stained looking
 glass, all broken and uneven.
 It was like someone had pieced together parts of another night sky; as
 if another place lay beyond that oval slit.
 The monster was limping heavily; it glanced at Ned and said nothing.
 Its eyes flashed suddenly, before it crossed into the oval slit, which
 then disappeared as strangely and abruptly as it had appeared.

Ned stood there unable to really understand what had happened.
 So did the others, apart from Theo who, seemingly unfazed, settled the
 sloop near the platform a bit awkwardly.
 He jumped off the ship and quickly tied her down to the tower with a mooring
 line.
 He sounded awfully excited when he rushed over by Ned's side.

Well, that pirate was making weird noises like the ones people do when they
 die and Bo seemed really worried when the ship began to wobble real bad.
 He kind of insisted that I placed my amulet in this weird slot in that
 awful chair, and then all the wobbling stopped.
 But the pirate died,

Oh, I heard this weird voice in my head and it felt all wrong; I was in
 the ship, where you told me to stay.
 But for some reason, Bo was already gnawing on that rope we had tied and
 before I could convince him otherwise, the ship had drifted away.
 So I thought I'd give her a spin,

 He closed one eye and aimed at Culliper, just as he was about to start
 running back to the ship.
 Winceham threw the stone expertly and it connected with Culliper's head
 at a very accident-prone spot; the back of his head.
 Culliper staggered for a couple of steps, before collapsing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The violet light between Theo's hands died down softly; he and Ned walked
 over to where Culliper lay.
 He wasn't exactly unconscious, but he looked painfully disoriented.
 His face sported a furrowed grin, quite suitable for someone possibly brain
 damaged.
 Ned caught him by the nape of his jacket and told him more so, than asked
 him:

 For those of you who haven't read Book I, I hope you'll get a copy after
 reading this.
 Get one for your friends as well; like a gift or maybe part of a sinister

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the first part of this one, we start off in space, where the party is
 pretty much bored and nothing much of interested has happened, with the
 exception of Ned writing down lyrics and jokes, and Theo practicing magic
 with the bunny.
 When they arrive at the docks at Tallyflop, our heroes try to negotiate
 the berthing charge which is essentially a rip-off from the goblin dockmaster.
 They are not allowed to disembark, cannons and various other weapons trained
 on them.
 Dialogue ensues with the goblin until they see no wait out but to sell
 the good ship (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

) to cover the cost and be allowed to dock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Tallyflop is a majestic huge oak tree floating in space, the various branches
 acting as docks, and harbors for larger and smaller ships.
 Transportation is conducted via a complex system of pulleys, ran by the
 Central, which also covers as the administrative and technical center for
 Tallyflop, and it is run by goblins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once they sell the ship they decide to split: Ned and Winceham try to gather
 information about the elves and connect with shady characters in shady
 bars, getting hammered.
 Word gets around they've been asking questions and a doppelganger is sent
 after their trail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The sisters take it upon themselves to carry Culliper and the other pirate
 to some sort of justice.
 There is none other system than the Pit, where those that seek to be righted
 pit themselves against each other in a swashbuckling contest to the death,
 complete with taunts and the like (ala Monkey Island).
 The loser is forced to walk the plank into space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theo and the rabbit are left to care for finding a ship - with the coin
 they can afford they can find nothing except when they happen upon Reylando
 Lettifer's shipwright, a bear with a monocle, who considers him an artist
 first and an engineer, scientist and thaumaturgist second (thaumaturgy
 is what makes the engine stuff work).
 He is touched by the elves' plight and offers Theo the opportunity to take
 away a small ship that needs a bit of work, and while they work on it together,
 there is this zen side of Reylando that vibrates with theo and the Jah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Part Two, Parcifal is walking the plank after having lost from Culliper.
 The crowd is restless, and Lernea is nowhere to be seen.
 Just before Parcifal gets the literal mechanical boot that will shoot her
 into space to suffocate, Lernea rushes in overheard and picks her up.
 They evade but the crowd goes wild, trashes everything the sisters just
 keep running
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ned and Winceham are trying to recover from the hangover, when Winceham's
 paranoia turns out to be the doppleganger.
 They form a plan to lure him in with offering to sell Theo's crystal.
 While talking the neutralise him and force him to spill the beans about
 the elves and who is on their trail.
 They learn the name of the monster that had posed as Hobb, or at least
 the one with which it went by more freely at tallyflop: it's real name
 is Vrexxzloth.
 The doppelganger though wasn't the only one on their trail: A lone Arcane
 (blue tall bleak guy without humor) seeks them out and wants to sell them
 the info they need on Vrexxzloth.
 They accept ad enter a binding soul contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theo has an unexplained affinity about fixing the ship that amazes Reynaldo.
 Theo shows him the amulet and he talks about the legend of Umria and a
 planet were once the focus of the universe was balanced in.
 That crystal is part of that planet, now thought to be lost.
 Theo feels there some connection with his father.
 That's when Ned and Winceham show up and tell Theo what happened and that
 the sisters are in danger.
 With that in mind, Bo sets off hurriedly.
 When they follow him, they find out the sisters were actually lauded as
 great performers of the swashbuckling art.
 Still Culliper has wandered free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Part Three:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They need to enter Central which is right at the root of the giant oak.
 They enter through the bulk of the hollowed out tree, with reynaldo helping
 them out, his license as a shipwright and thaumaturgist on the line.
 They descend the levels to find out that the really integral part of the
 Central is restricted and is actually a small city of illithid's, creating
 magical weapons using Tallyflop as a staging and resource gathering point,
 and Central's energy, a small sun, as a manufacturing power plant.
 They stealth their way in until theo gives their position away again.
 Reynaldo fights some of the illithid guards.
 They then set a number of slaves free including the elves and then the
 others make their way to the portal controls, through traps and guards
 alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Using the arcane's instructions they reset the portal generator and the
 whole root of Tallyflop turns into a portal to the asteroid field where
 the illithid elder brain operates from.
 They board the ship and fly off into it, to book III.

I've never really understood all those planet-bound folk that look at the

 lose their grip on reality, making up all sorts of ideas about what space

Ned was leaning against the upper deck railing, gazing at the milky blue
 sheen of a swarm of stars that showered the ship with a fuzzy, moon-like
 glow.
 For the last few days, ever since they'd sailed into the stars, a strange
 smile seemed to occupy his face for most of his waking time.
 In his sleep, all he could see was the glitter of stars and the image of
 his father, waving at him encouragingly to move on into a beautiful unknown.
 Or perhaps take an order; Ned wasn't clear on that.
 But it did make him feel better.
\end_layout

The ship traversed the deadness of space in a suitably dead silence; one

 the stars as their light bounced off the metal ramrod at its prow.

Winceham, the self-proclaimed, semi-retired halfuin rogue of the party was

 For the most part, Wince had enjoyed their journey so far, even though

Parcifal, the feisty redhead princess regent in exile, kept a mindful, worried
 eye at how her twin sister, Lernea, queen of Nomos for a day, handled the
 ship.
 It was in fact the look of utter and total boredom that worried Parcifal;
 it seemed like it was catching.

Theo, naturally inclined in the ways of sorcery, had just finished re-knitting
 his blond, silvery dreadlocks..
 The traditional hairdo of the woodkin elf, the dreadlock, didn't suit him,
 tall and fair-skinned as he was.
 But it was his people's heritage, even though he wasn't really one of them.
 Him and Bo, his fiery-eyed bunny companion were shooting fireworks far

 They looked unequivocally happy.

 humdrum quagmire that she felt their journey really was.

 filled with hay.
 Parcifal looked at the short halfuin with a perplexed frown, before she

 with the halfuin's behinds, shoving him off the cot and onto the hard deck.

No-one was at the ship's helm, a matter which was soon made entirely apparent
 to everyone as the ship began to slowly list to port.
 Just as Parcifal walked over to grab the helm firmly with a look of annoyance
 on her face, she saw Bo flying accross the air as if falling slowly sideways,
 his fluffy ears shooting up in strange directions, firm and upright as
 if frozen by an amazing sense of danger.
 Theo followed close behind, smiling as broadly as a child left to its devices,
 all alone with a cookie jar.
 Parcifal stood baffled, while Theo grabbed the helm as he flew past it
 and turned the ship back on its proper course.
 He twisted his body to settle his feet on the ground with the grace of
 a dancer.

Culliper lay in shackles in the hold; he'd told them as much as he knew

 He had been told to raid the village and that he would collect his pay

 Parcifal unsheathed Encelados and dutifully began to check the blade in

 It looked sharp as ever in the starlight.

 Parcifal noticed, and was quick to answer.

There!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Ned suddenly and pointed a finger, his excitement threatening to
 tear his face apart.
 Everyone turned their heads as if silently obeying an order.
 A moment or so passed before Parcifal asked with a somewhat surreptitious,
 wary look, her hand drawn to Encelados' hilt as if on its own:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Don't you see it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Ned as he rushed to the ship's bow like a five-year old waiting for
 ice cream to manifest itself out of thin air.
 Winceham furrowed his brow and toyed with his beard for a moment before
 he couldn't help ask himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What are we looking for, lad?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

That star! See how its light trembles? How it flickers, fading in and out?
 That's it! That must be Tallyflop!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Ned without taking his eyes off the trembling, pointy source of
 light.
 Bo's eyes lit up like a blowing furnace all of a sudden and he made sure
 he had Theo's full attention, jumping up and down around the ship's steering
 wheel.
 The elf knew the bunny meant business so he brought the ship's bow to bear
 dead-on where Bo had been pointing to with his whole body, much more like
 a hunting dog than an innocent-looking herbivore would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea spared a moment or so to take a look as well, barely lifting herself
 up from the cot.
 It was as if she was trying to peer over an invisible perch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

All I see is a twinkling star,

Bo sure looks excited!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at the star, growing subtly larger with every passing moment.
 Then she stared at the elf and the bunny for a moment or so, her look full
 of apprehension.
 She said to Theo:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Whenever those eyes flame up..
 Nothing good ever happens.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo would have none of that.
 He waved a hand dismissively; with eyes fixed on the twinkling star up
 ahead, he said firmly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Preposterous.
 Utterly unfounded.
 Pessimistic superstitious misconceptions.
 Bo's eyes flaming up and our own predicaments have absolutely no correlation,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wnceham turned and looked at Theo rather confounded.
 Yet he seemed to approve of Theo's answer, at least in principle.
 He nodded and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well said, lad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham smiled at Theo, who in turn bowed lightly towards the halfuin.
 The brief moment of well-earned flattery made Parcifall roll her eyes and
 sigh.
 Winceham, always prowling about to boost his ego in many small ways that
 to him added up to enormous amounts, was about to make a sly, wry comment
 on the virtuous of proper language and etiquette.
 The grin on his face was a sure sign he was going to enjoy it no matter
 what Parcifal's reaction would be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To his surprise though, the only words that came out of his mouth when his
 gaze ventured upwards before it came down again, had nothing to do with
 proper language and much less, etiquette:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Blasted, gracious, all-mighty hairy cactuses and a turtle-mother's tit!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal spent a moment with her flustered face stuck in a deep frown, trying
 to fit the words she had just heard into some order that might make sense.
 Her finger was already raised as a warning when she looked at Winceham
 with a seething glare and shouted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Recant, sirrah! I know an insult when I hear one, even if I can't fathom

 cried Ned as he ran towards the bridgehead, his head stuck upwards as if
 he were training for a sword-eating contest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal only had to look upwards to see both Theo and Bo were looking up
 as well, their faces and fur respectively strangely illuminated, standing
 perfectly still like under some sort of enchanting spell.
 Her hand instictively went for Encelados' once more but half-way it froze
 as well: the sight in front of her eyes had captivated her very soul, and
 the souls of everyone else as well, it seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were sailing under a majestic field of starlight; rivulets of stardust
 and beams of light wafted down from above, where the giant gnarly branches
 of an old, wizened tree dominated the starscape.
 Where before there had been nothing but the faintest pin-prickles of light
 and a dark, solemn void, now the ship felt like it drifted onwards amidst
 a giant forest in spring, like a butterfly loitering around a blooming
 flower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their course took them gracefully soaring by clusters of huge green leaves,
 easily the size of a hamlet or small village.
 The huge leaves emanated a faint greenish glow, while in the distance all
 around them, more and more leaves and branches appeared little by little,
 like some omnipotent invisible hand was clearing up a fog-stained window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Swaths of light and soft shadows crept over them at an easy pace as the
 ship continued on its course, as if sailing under a soft, thin, silken-coloured
 bedding the likes of which every child would only ever hope to dream about.
 A tunnel of light and shadow had manifested itself on top of a playful,
 shining net that tossed and writhed about them in a beautiful dance that
 seemed to have a breath of its own.

By Svarna, it's the most beautiful thing I've seen.
 Other than the Holy Mountain,

 instantly gone, her smile beaming with a shine her armor could never match.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

See? I told you Bo had a good reason for being excited.
 Isn't that right Bo?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo gleefully as he kept the ship steadily trained between a pair
 of nearly parallel branches that seemed to lead them on like a pair of
 guiding rails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then suddenly, literally out of nowhere, a ship the shape of a bumblebee
 and easily twice the size of the 
\shape italic
Mary Watchamacallit
\shape default

 sporting shoddy, badly trimmed sails.
 It would have been more fair to describe it as flying collection of scrap,
 rather than a ship per se.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mere fact though that a ship like that could actually sail into space,
 suddenly made the whole endeavor of traveling through the stars acutely
 unremarkable.
 If it wasn't for a pair of large harpoons trained on the 
\shape italic
Mary Watchamacallit

 have drawn everyone's attention with a snap.
 The oversized sharp implements of hunting and warfare were manned by unruly
 pairs of short, ugly, mischievous-looking green little things wearing ridiculou
sly extravagant goggles, oversized leather helmets and sadly, rather than
 shockingly, nothing more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's an ambush!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Parcifal and clutched Encelados defiantly with both hands, warily
 checking all around her, as if she half-expected more invisible threats
 to materialise any minute.
 The blade though, remained a shiny grey steel color; it did not give off
 its blueish glow of warning against evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It certainly looks like an ambush,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham not knowing whether he should ready his stiletto or finally
 have a try at space swimming.
 In retrospect, swimming in space did not seem like a dangerous waste of
 time in view of the harpoons.
 Theo remained silent exchanging some oddly thoughtful looks with Bo, even
 if that meant mainly staring at the rabbit's frenzied twitching nose.
 Its eyes though did not flare up; a charred mayhem seemed an ever distant
 possibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's fairly normal, I think,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Theo gave Ned a flat shrug, failing to see that an answer was not really
 expected of him.
 A deafening, snarling sound made everyone's face twitch and contort unpleasantl

 device:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Oy! 'Tis Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cough, a loud buzz and a shrieking noise followed in amplified fashion
 before the voice died down.
 The little green creatures wearing the goggles seemed to be enjoying this
 immensely, judging from the way they giggled and toyed around with the
 oversized harpoon launchers.
 Crude-looking contraptions as these were, they were menacingly sharp and
 shiny nonetheless.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the crew jumped off the goblin ship and floated in space, holding

 Ned asked Winceham who nodded affirmatively with a frown.
 Parcifal still held Encelados at a defensive stance, somehow waiting for
 the small, naked green goblin to transform into a towering champion of
 the goblin race.
 Reality, once more, failed to indulge her whims.

\begin_layout Standard

 Lernea scratched her head and straightened her back before opening her
 eyes wide enough to let what has happening around her sink in.
 In a moment of sudden, angst-ridden clarity she exclaimed:

 As both ships moved closer to the immense trunk that still looked not very

 The air smelled like a mix of oil, walnuts and grog gone horribly bad.

The air inside the goblin dockmaster's office had an almost suffocating
 quality.
 The atmosphere felt thick as oil, smelling of ink and rough, cheap paper.
 Tallyflop's dockmaster's office was built inside a hollowed out section
 of the giant oak's skin.
 Its walls rose steeply into a dark, shadowy place with no ceiling in sight.
 Goblin helpers and staff could be seen running atop tiny overhead railings
 and metal grates; they passed through glass pipes, along rope bridges and
 wooden ladders.
 The almost always insidious-looking creatures appeared suddenly and disappeared
 just as quickly through small trapdoors built in the wooden walls.
 Sniggering like madmen at times, many of them carried large stacks of papers
 strapped on their back; they were all invariably naked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea's look darted around uncomfortably.
 It was as if she felt soiled by her mere presence inside that room.
 Parcifal wore a brooding expression; her hands were stuffed in her armpits.
 She was pouting like a child scorned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham looked intently at the stacks of papers and scrolls rising up into
 nothingness.
 He could make out the goblins above, criscrossing the room with all the
 fury of rats in a cage.
 Stroking his fine beard, the odd look on his leathery face meant he still
 couldn't make up his mind about the goblins genitalia.
 He looked committed; he just had to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo sat on Theo's shoulder idly.
 The bunny rabbit was practically asleep; the flames on his eyes were nowhere
 to be seen.
 Theo was silently trying to count the books and ledgers surrounding them;
 he had managed to start over and over again more than a few times.

Ned sported a troubled look and a screwed up face.
 He was trying to understand what it was exactly they were dealing with.

 The goblin sitting down behind an oversized desk in front of him, had earlier
 identified himself as Tallyflop's dockmaster who went by the name of Zed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goblin was wearing nothing more than a smudged, shattered monocle.
 It was very doubtful that the monocle was able to serve its original purpose,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 exclaimed Parcifal and red hot anger poured from her voice.
 The dockmaster raised his head and looked at her through the monocle, blinking
 eratically and trying - impossible though it seemed - to focus for a moment
 or two.
 He dived into the huge ledger in front of him again before answering; he
 waved a bony hand dismissively.

\begin_layout Standard
The goblin took a moment to himself; he then looked at all of the party
 crammed inside the little space that remained in front of his desk.
 With a raised brow he said flatly before returning his attention to his
 ledger, dipping a pen in some ink and adding a smudge that highly resembled
 goblin genitalia on the side of a page:

I can see that.
 Where does it say you have the authority to do that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned pointing to the goblin crew outside the tiny window on their back.
 The goblin wrecking crew were hoisting down the sails.
 Lernea looked behind her shoulder and saw a large metal barrel-like construct
 on wheels, pushed on a ramp.
 It had a number of saws and hatchets attached to it and left a trail of
 smoke as it vibrated violently on the 
\shape italic
Mary Whatchamacallit's
\shape default
 deck.
 The next moment, it exploded with a dumbed-down thud, senting perhaps a
 dozen goblins flying off into space.
 A rush of maniac laughter and snot-brained giggling followed suit before
 the wrecking crew went back to what appeared to be just another day's work
 for goblins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 replied the dockmaster and barely nodded to the shackled figure of Culliper,
 his mouth gagged with a very unhygienic-looking rag.
 Culliper was propped upright, tightly pressed between Lernea and Parcifal;
 he rolled his eyes but no-one was paying any attention to him, except perhaps
 for Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned shot the pirate a hard look.
 His jaw tightened and his face became ashen gray.
 Ned's mind went back a few days; it was a very misfortunate series of events
 that had led them all the way to space and Tallyflop.
 The matter of Culliper's fate remained still a matter to settle.
 Ned felt the pressure piling up; he looked like he was about to grab the
 dockmaster by the throat when Zed cleared his throat just in time to prevent
 that.

Ned took a deep breath and cringed his face with a hand.

\begin_layout Standard
A loud creaking sound was then heard, followed by a couple of thuds and
 reverberating knocks.
 The floor vibrated a little, grabbing almost everyone's attention, except
 for Ned and the dockmaster; their gazes were locked in a silent, mysterious
 struggle.
 Outside, at the pier, the goblin wrecking crew had just chopped off the
 main mast and were trying to peel off it what had previously been a somewhat
 less flat, more alive, goblin.
 There wasn't much laughter involved, at least not until the moment one
 of them brandished a literally bloody spatula, much to the merriment of
 his co-workers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal exploded with a shout, condemning the lack of logic behing the

Theo was now trying to count goblin parts and limbs flying off from the

 the dockmaster's saw-like teeth failing to follow the geometry of the mouth.

 trailing some other piece of text.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is there a problem with that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal sharply and tried to approach the goblin threateningly.

 Her sister shook her head disapprovingly and motioned her to just stay

 craftmanship or the safety of the wrecking crew.

 said Theo suddenly and everyone looked at him as if realising for the first
 time he might not be actually aware of his surroundings most of the time.
 On the other hand, Bo seemed quite alert and perky; yet his eyes weren't
 lit up.
 He simply wiggled his nose and scratched an ear with a hind leg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It doesn't make much sense to hack down the whole supporting structure on

 said Lernea nodding thoughtfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Still, it can't be all that valuable.
 I mean, how much firewood does a city this size need, really? It's not

 especially since he stood smack in the middle of them all, hardly able
 to breathe properly, crammed as they were.

\begin_layout Standard

 The goblin nodded affirmatively and tried to smile congenially; the end

By steam, you mean that thing that's like smoke, except it only appears

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Winceham, a very uncertain expression painted on his face.
 He absent-mindedly scratched his chin, breadcrumbs falling off his beard.
 None bothered to answer him; they were rather trying to absorb the implicit
 declaration that the smell about Winceham wasn't just a matter of unfortunate
 timing, but rather a way of life.
 The minimal space inside the dockmaster's office made it all but impossible
 to ignore.

Well, now that we've got everything sorted out, would you be bloody kind

 said the dockmaster and as luck would have it, a goblin passed overhead
 riding a small unicycle on a rope and tossed an impossibly thick book on
 a huge stack that came crushing down barely a moment later, adding a little
 bit of height in a small hill behind Zed made entirely out of paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The bunny seemed to concur, if one were an expert on reading whiskers.
 Theo's answer once again drew some weird looks but this time those were
 looks of surprise, coupled with the usual failure to really understand
 what he was talking about.

 said Ned with a face shaken by a sudden, acute realisation.
 He looked at Lernea and without uttering a word, he saw that same look
 mirrored in her face.
 She was at a loss for words for a moment.
 Zed was trying to look inconspicuous while eyeing a strangely illustrated
 centerfold page dangling from his ledger, containing fancy, dressed up
 goblins of indeterminate sex.

You're not selling the metal bits as well?

 Ned picked her train of thought, nodded and went a step farther:

Everyone, except Parcifal, even Bo, looked at Ned like he had just admitted

 Culliper did not even flinch; his stabbing stare was stuck on Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What chair?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked the goblin looking suddenly quite intrigued; he then started shuffling
 the pages in the ledger in front of him with furious speed, one eye searching
 the text on the pages and the other not daring to leave the naughty centerfold
 page out of sight.

Ned lad, that's bloody slavery,

 said Winceham with a hushed, almost fearful voice.
 Lernea looked troubled, while Parcifal was smiling, either lost in thought

 The former queen of Nomos for a day looked at Ned with a pang of worry

Yes.

 said Ned and shot a bland look at Culliper.
 The pirate's eyes looked like small, glistening beads.
 He made no effort to so much as croak a muffled pleading voice.
 Instead, it looked as if his mouth curled up in a wicked, sly smile.

 who rarely jumped in to actually help someone else understand, helpfully
 added with a smile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The grog dispenser was the strange barrel with the lever and the tap near

The goblin gave the matter a small amount of thought while drool with the

 He was looking at the centerfold page intently wild-eyed and frenzied when
 he suddenly cried

 After a moment of reflexive hesitation, Ned shook it firmly; he then couldn't
 help but look at Culliper for a long, tense moment before he turned to
 leave.
 He fell on Parcifal and realised she was blocking the narrow, short exit.
 She was still lost in her own, grin-inducing thoughts.

What have you done, Ned?

 Once past the exit he looked at Lernea with what must've been guilt and
 told her:

\begin_layout Standard

I needed to do something about it,

 said Ned and shrugged slightly.
 Lernea bit her lip and shot a look at Culliper who was already being whisked
 away using a harness and a pulley, ever higher and higher by goblins hidden
 from sight.
 His ice-cold gaze sparkled away into the darkness; Culliper and Ned locked
 eyes.
 A moment of gritty tension passed like glue becoming undone; Ned felt like
 he had already made a terrible, unavoidable mistake.

A moment later, Winceham asked Ned even as the others left the crowded office

 look, as if something new and wonderful had just happened.

His fingers went for the crystal around his neck.

 she said and Theo, who had been feeding Bo a thick stick of limegrass from
 one of his many pockets, inserted the crystal around his neck in the slot
 on the chair and by way of magic, it floated easily almost a foot above
 the air.

 Nifty little thing this crystal, isn't it? I wonder how it actually works,

 using just one finger.
 He shook his head approvingly and said:

My sister always tends to act before thinking.
 If she had just waited to exchange a few simple words, we wouldn't need

 of people below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's Parcifal alright,

 said Theo without realising the full implications of what he was seeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned and Lernea exchanged knowing, troubled looks and sprang to a running
 pace, while Bo jumped off Theo's lap, flames brilliantly wild in his eyes.
 The bunny easily outran them both in a few heartbeats.
 Theo then realised that something important was happening and decided he
 just might as well fly towards the glow instead of hopping along so inefficient
ly.
 He leapt off the promenade and into the vaccuum with the practiced ease
 of someone putting on his slippers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the time he realised something was slightly off, he was freefalling,
 trying to swim in the dead of space and doing a frightfully awful job of

 Lernea had her back, arrows flying from her bow with a trained, fast pace.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Phew! What a putrid smell!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, attracting aggravated looks from Ned even in the thick of
 battle.
 The halfuin was ready to make a wry comment when his senses alerted him
 to a new threat.
 He stepped on the ledge of the promenade and vaulted himself into the air
 with a backflip; the next moment he landed on the wooden floor, his tiny
 yet lethal blade stuck in the neck of an orc.
 Vile green blood gushed in spurts as the orc toppled and fell off the promenade
 and onto the void of space, without so much as a gurgling sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That came too close, Wince!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Ned and reloaded his crossbow with a new bolt.
 He took aim at two orcs who were rushing the sisters with a pair of raised
 bucklers.
 Ned took his time before he let fly a shot; it missed wildly at the last
 moment.
 The orcs drew their weapons, a murky blood-spat axe and a rough whaler's
 spear.
 Ned was already reloading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Incoming, lasses!

 cried Winceham and filled his sling with a hefty ball of lead, a memoir

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was locked in a swordfight with the orc that was, in all probability,
 the gang's leader.
 It was a tall, brutish orc with a lisp; he wore real mail and the nasty
 ability to dodge and parry like the devil's barbed tail.
 Lernea heard the halfuin's warning just in time; she quickly loaded her
 bow with two arrows and knelt cooly.
 The crowd applauded at the apparently rare exhibit of teamwork the party
 was providing; most of the boardwalk was filled with people wanting to
 take a peek at the unscheduled fight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yer worth the money, ya ferretth!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the tall orc, as he parried yet another blow from Parcifal aimed
 squarely at the small gap at his neck, between his helmet and his armor.
 Lernea held her breath and let the arrows fly even as the orcs were ready
 to leap onto her; the next instant, their weapons were flying harmlessly
 in the air, all the rush of their wielders diminished with a sudden flop.
 The two orcs were lying slumped against the floor, an arrow having pierced
 their skulls clean through.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blathted windth o' Morrogah! I thould've athked for double the coin!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted the tall brute of an orc.
 He then dodged a blow that would've cut his arm off in the nick of time
 and managed to tackle Parcifal with a sweep of his leg, dropping her on
 the ground.
 All of a sudden, there was a blinding flash of light; thick smoke covered
 everything as far as anyone from the party could see.
 A mistimed flurry of missiles was absorbed into the cloud harmlessly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Ned and coughed slightly as the thick smoke made it difficult to

Short bloke's team won! Pay up, ya sorry gippos!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said a delighted, rough voice coming from somewhere outside the smoke cloud
 that was slowly clearing up.
 The cheery tone of his voice was starkly contrasted by a lot of muttering
 and swearing for those that had placed the losing bet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood back on her feet, panting from the exertion.
 Encelados had never left her grasp; the blade was silver gray again, yet
 stained with dried orcish blood, the colour of weathered copper.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 she said in a whisper and wiped the sweat on her furrowed brow with her

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The promenade slowly returned to its more usual hubbub; the traders at the
 stalls picked up from they had left and started shouting their offers of
 smelly sea-urchins-on-a-stick, while groups of sailors were busy smashing
 cups of grog against each other's head again.
 A few of the intelligentsia even applauded the party as the smoke eventually
 cleared and cheered them on for an entertaining, well-performed fight.
 A couple even tossed some coin at Ned and Winceham's feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How do they dare mock us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Lernea as she was rounding up her arrows from all the orc bodies
 she had felled.
 Ned wasn't sure about the crowd's reaction; he looked up, around the trees'
 giant leaves and branches where other boardwalks snaked their way.
 Up there, all around, small gangs of crowds amassed as well, gazing from
 shady balconies and lit terraces alike.
 By the looks of it, deadly combat counted as entertainment for these people.
 It was a troubling idea that the halfuin was quick to analyze more fully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nah, they're just being appreciative.
 A good fight's always a good fight around places like these.
 The jokes helped as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham offering his own perspective as he gathered the coins, as
 well as any and all valuables the orcs carried on their persons, especially
 if those that showed any teeth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I didn't tell any jokes,

 mouth.

 Lernea looked at her sister sternly.

Lernea walked over to Ned's side.
 Parcifal asked with a feeling of uncertainty:

Are you referring to me?

\begin_layout Standard

Would you mind your step please, missus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said a tall, lank fellow with a bland, ghostly pale face who seemed to
 have appeared out of nowhere.
 An almost identical man beside him was pulling a rather large handcart.
 They were dressed in simple, loose-fitting violet-colored robes and matching
 sandals.
 The two men began to load one of the bodies onto the cart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Lernea as if someone had just spilled milk and cookies on her palace's

Just clearing up the promenade.
 If you don't mind,

 came an answer without any sort of color in the voice, except perhaps bland
 indifference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly, an arrow zipped through the air and got stuck on the pale-faced
 man's back.
 He slightly furrowed his brow, smiled hesitantly, and fell dead right on
 top of the body he was carrying.
 Lernea took a step back reflexively and saw there was a note attached to
 the arrow.
 The other man in the robe observed a moment's silence and nodded to himself
 pensively.

Mack always said he wanted to go out on the job.

 bodies without another word.
 Lernea overcame her shocked surprise and read the note.
 Her face became an oblique mask of harsh determination.

\begin_layout Standard

 Ned shrugged and paused for a moment.
 At length, he said:

Maybe he's lost.
 Maybe he was scared, I don't know.
 Maybe he's just fooling around, who can tell? It's Theo.

Affinity,

How do we go about that? We just got jumped in plain view.

I think I know the right man for the job.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The halfuin noticed, exhaled a puff of smoke and said with utmost sincerity
 and a misguided sense of manliness:
\end_layout

Theo opened his eyes and couldn't see a thing.
 He blinked a couple of times until his eyes adjusted to the nearly total
 lack of light.
 Still, he saw nothing more than a faint orange glow caressing a crude opening
 somewhere to his right.
 He surmised he was in a large room of some kind.
 The atmosphere was warm and pleasant, with an earthly feeling about it.
 Theo felt his hands itch; he then heard the sound of rustling leaves as
 he propped himself up, resting on his hands.
 He was lying on a bed of leaves.
 Oak leaves, judging by their fuzziness factor.
 Theo only knew this wasn't where he was supposed to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then remembered falling off the promenade, trying to swim in space after
 flying had somehow failed him.
 And then he remembered the piers off the huge branches, all kinds of ships
 in their berths; lights on the promenades and the ledges of the giant tree.
 Everything had seemed to go by at a steady, easy speed.
 Perhaps it was him falling downwards, he wondered briefly; he never was
 good with the technicalities of events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got up and blindly staggered forward, his hands splayed with open palms.
 He was hoping to find a wall or a lamp, anything that could illuminate
 his whereabouts in any helpful way, literally or not.
 His eyes tried to pierce the darkness, without much success.
 It wasn't the usual sort of darkness his elven eyes could at least help
 him navigate without tripping and landing on something unhealthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the first few steps, the sound of leaves under his feet became a mute,
 silent caress.
 Theo was stepping on fuzzy, soft grass.
 His outstretched hands then bumped onto something soft and furry.
 The unknown surface was warm and inviting to the touch; it felt strange
 to Theo, yet somehow familiar.
 He seeked its outline with both hands; the soft fuzziness stretched onto
 a wide arc before it dipped downwards and then upwards again, like some
 sort of peculiar mass of rolling hills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I gather you're awake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said a deep, rumbling voice with a hint of annoyance, followed by a low-keyed

 No answer came from Theo; he was hard at thought about how to answer.
 It wasn't a question per se, but it did make him think about whether or
 not he was genuinely awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure.
 How can I tell if this isn't a dream?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo in absolute seriousness, his hands groping the soft furriness
 in front of him reflexively.
 He then felt a slap across his face that left him speechless and his hands
 frozen stiff, now groping nothing but air.
 There was a loud clap-like sound like wood meeting stone and then light
 suddenly poured from numerous points that seemed set in a circle around
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As light filled the emptiness it quickly defined a large enclosed space,
 the natural walls nothing more than huge root outgrowths.
 Theo realised he was in an indoor grove of sorts; the dirt floor was covered
 in grass.
 There flowers, various small trees and little gardens; water and naked
 roots abounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most inescapable reality though was that the voice seemed to belong
 to a nine-foot tall bear wearing a bright, orange toga down to its waist,
 decorated with blood-red shapes and some sort of writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo glanced at his splayed hands and realised his shoulders were the same
 height as the bear's behinds.
 The bear, as if on cue, turned around and lowered its head.
 Theo hoped that perhaps by some sort of small mercy and an inordinate amount
 of luck the bear would be deaf, dumb and blind.
 It wasn't so; the beer stooped low and seeked eye contact with Theo.
 Its eyes were the colour of honey and its rotund, white-grey face nearly
 filled Theo's view in an imposing manner.
 The elf raised his eyes almost involuntarily; their gazes locked.
 There was a stern, crystal-clear shine about the bear's eyes, like a pair
 of tiny, spotless, golden mirror beads.
 The bear stood there for a moment before it made a statement with an elevated
 sense of importance.

 said Theo, his eyes darting all around the floor and then the walls, literally
 searching for some kind of path or trail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the bear and bowed with reverence, its great paws pointing to its
 huge chest, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

and without,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 it added stretching its hands.
 Theo looked nothing less than confused.
 He barely managed a word purely out of trying to appear polite, especially
 since he had - however inadvertently - grabbed the bear's behinds not a
 minute earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Ah.

The bear motioned with one paw for Theo to lay himself on the ground as
 it did so as well.
 Theo looked a bit undecided, but nevertheless sat down on a patch of grass
 right beside a short, delicate-looking tree.
 Water ran under it in a small stream not wider than a man's palm.
 The bear sat itself down near the old, mossy bark of the wooden walls.
 A few feet separated the two of them.
 When the bear spoke, its voice reverberated serenely across the picturesque
 grove.

Theo searched his robe's pockets and felt embarassed to find nothing but
 a piece of lint.
 He then realized the crystal was still lodged inside that strange chair.
 That also brought to mind Bo; the bunny was nowhere around.
 Theo suddenly felt a chill rise up his spine and a terrible feeling of
 loneliness overcame him.
 The bear saw Theo was looking nervous.

The bear nodded and flexed its torso around in an astounding show of agility.
 It reached for a couple of bear-sized wooden cups perched on a natural
 shelf along the walls.
 He offered one cup to Theo who held it in both hands much more like he
 would a jar or a vase.
 The bear put its own cup down on the ground and made a gesture with both
 its front legs that it used readily like arms.
 It matched both its paws, flexing the edges preternaturally, forming some
 kind of winged shape, and closed its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A loud hum then reverberated outwards from the bear's chest in a rhythmic
 pattern.
 The humming stopped abruptly a few moments later, just as it was beginning
 to become too loud for comfort.
 Theo was about to ask for a cup the size he could handle, when suddenly
 a swarm of lights filled the grove.
 They whirled around them with a benign, almost melodic buzz.
 The swarm looked like tiny sparkles of glittering raindrops fluttering
 in the air; it suddenly split in two, and each part dived away like a single
 mass in each cup, spinning wildly inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next moment, their shininess was no more; all that remained was little
 ember specks wafting in the air, vanishing as swiftly as they had appeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear raised its cup and bowed imperceptibly.
 It then opened its eyes and cocked its head in a manner which implied it
 was having a spiffy time indeed.
 That, or it was right about ready to rip the living flesh out of Theo in
 one bite.

 Theo looked at his own cup and saw a wonderful, golden-hued liquid sloshing
 easily about the cup, starry like a summertime's sea.
 Theo took a careful, measured sip.
 His mouth felt like an ocean tide ridden with flowers; his stomach was
 instantly placated and felt full.
 His heart felt warm and his mind was put at ease.
 It felt like drinking the stuff of dreams.

The loud, corny music stopped every time something or someone was flung

 with every round of drinks that was announced to be on the house.
 Apparently, no-one knew what the tavern was called or if it even had a

 As someone had scribbled on one wall, the grog must flow.

So you haven't heard an elven tribe from warmer climates? Or maybe about

 Have you? We are very interested in procuring them, for a more than modest

 said Lernea and stared at the ogre meaningfully, letting her words sink
 in with as much a feeling of innuendo as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She laid herself back on the rather uncomfortable chair and tried to smile
 wryly.
 The rather uncomfortable seat coupled with the unruly, ugly company at

 a mentally retarded grin.

Wha'at did she 'ay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked the ogre through its cave of a mouth, its teeth a purely decorative
 add-on, long ago lost and never found.
 The ogre was the fat, grey-green sort; a typical example of its kind.
 Its rotund belly was a good indicator that actually chewing one's food
 was not a prerequisite for most ogres.
 Especially those that were usually employed as muscle in the various nefarious
 trading agreements that took place all too commonly in Tallyflop.

She's asking, as far as I can recall, if you've ever seen a flying bunny

 Or a bunch of dark-skinned hoots wearing strips of leather instead of normal
 clothes.
 Something along those lines,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 explained Winceham and filled his mouth with what was left of his drink.
 After making a show of sloshing the house special, the last bottle of Mythriam'
s Loxsene Famous Grog around his mouth, he swallowed it succesfully; which
 was, without throwing up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham seemed to feel a bit queasy for a moment before he fell off his
 stool.
 Lernea scoffed at him and barely spared Wince a fleeting yet chastising
 gaze; she returned her full, undivided attention to the ogre.
 She smiled awkwardly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well? Have you at least heard about a gang called the Culprits?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked with her eyebrow furrowed in a way that implied a conniving,
 insidious sort of discussion was taking place, while in fact it was more
 of a conniving, insidious monologue.
 The ogre was busy scratching a layer of crust made out of some sort of
 fungi on its belly; it completely missed the delicately contrived facial
 expression on Lernea's face.

Well then, do you know of anyone who does?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Lernea sighed.
 She was a staunch believer in diplomacy, but it looked like they were wasting
 their time.
 She was about to grab Winceham from his accessory belt and drag him away

 smashed.

It then indeed proceeded to hit himself in the head with its powerful fists;
 the ogre's eyes went rolling for a while and its head swerved this way
 and that, the eyeballs trying to remain in their sockets.
 He raised a blotched hand in front of his face; he had two fingers raised.
 He then hit itself in the head once more.
 The ogre was nearly passed out but it stood its ground on its chair, which
 comprised of a big rock; imported furniture, the good stuff.
 At length, after it could focus its eyes once more, it spoke once more.
 There was a recognizable amount of hurt in its voice:

 The gesture went unnoticed, as the ogre was now eating some of the pinkish

\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's been less than pleasurable doing business with you,

Winceham bowed slightly and he showed Lernea the exit.
 As if in a trance, she slowly got up from her seat and straightened the
 bow strung on her back.
 They began jostling their way through the mostly drunken, massive crowd

 Lernea was right behind him, trying to make sense out of that when a heavily

 said Winceham and picked up someone else's drink from a messy, knife-ridden

 Lernea kept following Winceham blindly, trusting he really knew a way towards
 the exit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 tavern, anointed in a cloud of smoke, gunpowder and grog fumes.
 A single sign outside the otherwise unassuming establishment read `B-Warez'.

 Their teeth had been invariably lessened in number; their flimsy-looking

Listen, some people..

 Theo is missing and Bo has been abducted.

 said Ned in what was his most reprimanding tone.
 That meant he simply sounded a bit disappointed, but Parcifal seemed to
 take it badly even so.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned.

I'll just leave you first if I can't be of any help.
 Do not fret, I won't go missing!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted and simply shot off into the milling crowd, never to return
 a stare.
 In very few moments, Ned had lost her from sight.
 One thing he had head out on the streets of Tallyflop seemed certain to
 him now: people could just disappear or be made to just disappear in the
 blink of an eye.
 Ned somehow didn't really worry that Parcifal would really go missing;
 he knew she simply had a flair for the dramatic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever her issues, they would have to wait, Ned thought to himself.
 In his heart, Theo and Bo took precedence, even though it was Theo's woodking
 people that they were supposed to be trying to save.
 But there was no talk of them either.
 Perhaps Culliper had managed to fool them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned's mind raced: the throne from the ship and Theo's crystal were perhaps
 a lot more important than any of them had thought.
 The fact that these people who called themselves Culprits had snatched
 the chair first and foremost, strengthened that perception.
 Their note said they'd return Bo once they were done, and that did nothing
 but make things more complicated.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were with Wince,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and try as he might, he couldn't see the halfuin anywhere nearby.
 It was a busy, packed time on the promenade.
 There was a Trading Circus in town; the streets were filled with exotic
 pack animals, laden with riches from around the cosmos.
 The sight caught Ned's eye as a small caravan passed.
 A beautiful, elephant-like creature of a smaller size caught Ned's attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Will you look at those things? I've never seen anything like that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

They're just beasts from a far away place.
 Not unlike mules.
 There's hundreds of them in the streets.
 Who cares?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and did not bother to even glance their way.
 She had a strange grin; it looked as if she'd been drinking.
 Ned noticed and couldn't help asking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where's Winceham? You didn't have any drinks together, did you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Would that be wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea with a furtive look in her eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm just saying, he didn't convince you into going off into a wild drinking
 binge, did he? It's a tendency of his.
 A condition, he calls it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded thoughtfully for a moment.
 Then she smiled widely and put a finger to her temple, as if she had just
 remembered something.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does he now? Well, he did stop for a drink on the way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, trying to make it sound as if it was really just one drink, while
 in fact multiple drinks were being implied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's just great.
 Your sister ran off just a minute ago.
 I don't think she's gone missing like Theo though; she just needed her
 head cleaned up.
 For all I know, she just might drink her mind off it with Wince,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned gloomily and shrugged.
 He went on as the magnificent beasts of the Trading Circus rode past them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's probably just as well.
 We didn't get anything useful; just a few street thugs with broken arms,
 bruised bodies and rotten egos.
 What about you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, looking at Lernea with a hopeful smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing at all.
 Everyone is so tight-lipped.
 You didn't get anything? Anything about the Culprits? Anything about Theo?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded anxious all of a sudden.
 Her eyes searched Ned's face thoroughly, inquisitively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Zilch.
 Parcifal was rather efficient at making people run on sight.
 Still, what low-lifes we could get our hands on seemed like they really
 knew nothing about the Culprits.
 In fact, most of them didn't seem to even understand the word,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see.
 Well, in that case, I think I need a word alone with you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, her voice tuned down a notch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alone? We're pretty much alone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and waved at the indifferent crowds of people that surrounded
 them.

 said Ned and nodded with arms crossed over his chest, his eyes locked onto
 Lernea's worried face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's Parcifal.
 She's really not being herself lately.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, you certainly know her better than I do, but if I were to make an
 educated guess, I think she's just being jealous of you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea sounded surprised and oddly excited at the same time.
 She touched Ned's arm with a sense of purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, why should she be?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't know, I'm not sure.
 I must've said something about you that ticked her off.
 But I'm not sure what or why for that matter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and his gaze came to stand at Lernea's hand.
 She was practically leaning against him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, that's just like my sister now.
 Ever since she was a toddler.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned and felt her warm breath inching closer to his face.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're only a minute apart,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a baffled look.
 His eyes fell randomly at Lernea's chest, but it didn't appear to be so
 random.
 She saw that and twisted her gaze away from him suddenly in a dramatic
 fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still though, she's the little one.
 But enough about her.
 I think I might have a lead about the elves.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 said Ned feeling perplexed.
 Something bothered him, but he couldn't pin it down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But there is a lead! And we need to follow it!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with urgency, both her hands gripping Ned's arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright.
 We need to pick up Winceham first.
 It'll be easy to spot him; he might be small but he can make a lot of noise.
 Especially when he's had his version of a couple of drinks.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned made to turn and leave towards the direction Lernea came from.
 She grabbed him by one arm; there was a tone of instant anger in her objection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no time for that.
 After all, he'll need to get sobered up before he can be of any use.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well then let's find Parcifal.
 She's bound to be somewhere near,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and started off toward the main boardwalk where Parcifal had lost
 herself.
 Lernea would simply not have it; there was an edge to her voice that had
 never been there before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not listening; there's no time.
 Our lead is leaving on a ship!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A ship? What's the plan then? Jump him in the docks?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned incredulously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 Just follow me.
 I know a short cut.
 We can catch him on his way there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and went right into the same alley where Parcifal had dispensed
 her sort of justice to the poor thugs of Tallyflop's trade district.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? Just the two of us? Is he alone? What sort of lead? Can't we just
 talk about this first?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned while Lernea was already making her way to the shadowy cleft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Through that alley?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned once more, pointing a hesitant finger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea insisted with a broken voice, and an alien, ice cold gaze.
 Ned shrugged warily and followed her from a distance.
 He saw her bow strung across her back clearly and noticed something odd:
 she had her bow on the opposite way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Something wrong with your bow?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why do you ask that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a shallow voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm just saying.
 It looks like you have it on wrong.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, I'm just trying out if it works better this way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and kept walking towards the shadowy alley.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About last night..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned and let his voice trail off.
 Lernea came to a stop and turned around to face him slowly.
 There was a strange grin on her face.
 Her voice was little more than a whisper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about last night?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Don't you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned with a frown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Of course I do! But now is not the time to reminisce!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't it? I thought it was a special night.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a voice full of hurt.
 His hands went to his waist, near his crossbow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked at his blurry eyes intently.
 Her face warmed up, her eyes shone with sweetness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course I do! We can get together again later, but right now we must --
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he knew.
 Ned suspected it, he had felt it in his gut, but it was at that moment
 that he knew whoever that was, it wasn't Lernea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Even odds suck, don't they? Just who the hell are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impostor changed his body stance.
 She now stood defiant, a mad grin on her face.
 She cocked her head sideways and looked at Ned with a crazy, wide-eyed
 look.
 Her eyeballs turned pitch black in the blink of an eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm just a messenger.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really? What's the message?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, the crossbow now firmly in his hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hobb sends his greetings!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and backflipped into the shadows of the alley with blinding speed,
 in a cat-like fashion.
 Ned let fly the loaded bolt but he was more than just a heartbeat too slow.
 The bolt failed to hit; what was more alarming, it was as if the shadow
 had eaten the fake Lernea alive.
 Not an edge of her shape was to be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned put away the crossbow and took up his machete; a gift from Theo.
 Again, he was too slow; a tentacle reached out from the shadows and twisted
 itself around his arm.
 It reeled him in with such force that he flew in the air, his arm nearly
 pulled out of his socket.
 He saw the flash of cold steel and the glint of four evil, frosty blue
 eyes.
 He tried to flex his body out of harm's way but he knew that metal flash
 was meant for him; he knew those eyes.
 He'd seen those kind of eyes before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another flash of metal nearly blinded him; he felt something cold cover
 his face in spurts.
 His arm was free and he was laying on the ground, half-covered inside the
 shadow.
 He tried to stand up, the machete still firmly in his hand.
 He saw another tentacle shoot out from the darkness, but it wasn't meant
 for him.
 It was aiming for someone wearing dark, tight robes and wielding two short
 blades that seemed too thin to be real.
 A hood kept the stranger's face hidden from view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned saw the tentacle cleanly cut away, squirming and spurting a thick murky
 liquid, like milk of some kind; it was the same liquid that was dripping
 down his chin.
 The robed figure then let his blades fly blindly inside the supernatural
 shadow; instead of crashing against the alley's bark-skinned wall, two
 huge spurts of that same white liquid shot in the air.
 A hollow, otherworldly shriek was heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea's impostor then shot out from the shadow with unnatural alacrity,
 cartwheeling past the robed figure faster than before.
 She was trying to escape; Ned was on his feet and running after her.
 A few heartbeats later she slumped on the wooden plank floor of the promenade
 like someone invisible had tackled her.
 Three star-like pieces of metal were stuck on her spine.
 A shiny metallic sort of liquid oozed from her lethal wounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stood there for a moment, unsure of what had just happened.
 He gathered his wits about him and turned around with the machete in his
 good hand, as ready as he could be.
 The distinctly calm voice of a woman sought to allay his fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're safe, at least for now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the woman said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The robed figure drew its blades from the shadow and waved violently them
 in the air; white droplets of blood sprinkled the promenade's floorboards.
 The rest trickled down the flawless blades with ease.
 Ned realised his heart was beating fast; his hair was standing up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down.
 We need to find the rest of your party; they could be in danger as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Those things were a doppelganger and his assasin pet, a Sidian starfish.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned looked at the fake Lernea's dead body and shook his head in disbelief.
 There were so many things that begged explanation, but it felt like they
 had to wait.
 He looked at the woman in robes but was almost too afraid to ask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know you didn't want me killed, that's for sure.
 I probably owe you my life.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the robed woman and with a sudden burst of speed, she sprang right
 next to Ned and hugged him tight as a baby.
 Ned's response was to freeze in surprise.
 So close to him, he saw her cheeks under the limelight and knew she was
 grinning.
 Barely a breath later they were climbing up the giant oak's bark, pulled
 up in the air by a shiny silvery line, thinner than a strand of hair.
 Ned would have loved to sound more courteous, but the extraneous circumstances
 didn't allow for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Just who the hell are you lady?

 he shouted through the rush of the night air.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said huskily as they rose higher and higher.
 Below them, at the spot of the pretty uneven fight, a cart pulled over
 and a tall, lank man began loading the bodies.
 He had some trouble when he came upon the one with the tentacles.

 said Tej from across the small grove.
 Theo nodded mostly to himself, took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
 He began to concentrate.
 His face at first appeared to be calm, yet there were stern, sharp shadows
 lining it within a few moments.
 A vein on his head began to throb; then another down his neck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo started trembling visibly; his whole body shook with mounting tremors.
 His face became flush-red, his breathing had practically stopped; he gave
 the impression he was about to explode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can't!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Theo with a feeling of immense relief, panting thoroughly, yet breathing
 once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tej wasn't looking at him.
 He was checking up on some of his bee hives, built on corners and crevices
 all over the old hollowed-out root system that had been turned into a network
 of corridors, hallways and storage space for what Tejwel called his

\begin_layout Standard

 said the bear and licked a paw dripping with glowing honey.
 Small droplets flew in the air and fell away from Tej and Theo, flying
 not towards the ground but all along the length of a corridor that led
 to the void of space.
 Theo sighed, breathed deeply once more and concentrated again, this time
 with steely-eyed determination.
 Tej paused and shot a wary look around him; he had noticed the breeze was
 blowing in the wrong way.
 In truth, there was no wrong or right way down there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things worked in a very peculiar manner so very near the root of the giant
 oak, which Tej referred to as the Khidr.
 Water would sometimes freeze without it being cold.
 At other times, the heat would turn the small reclusive garden into a steamy
 jungle and at times everything would float in the air, especially the glowbees.
 They formed a cloud of light as they helplessly tried to find which way
 was up and which was down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 No matter how much he tried, the heavy barrel of clay filled with glowhoney
 hadn't budged an inch.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe I'm wrong,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tej and licked another honey-laden finger with delight, his enormous
 face squirming reflexively.
 Theo was sitting on the grassy floor, his legs crossed in what felt like
 a knot at first.
 Exactly in front of him sat a huge, immovable barrel made of clay, filled
 with last year's glowhoney.
 Theo looked morose at best.

\begin_layout Standard

But I think something is holding you back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the bear and stood in front of the beehive, breathing heavily.
 Theo opened his eyes and saw Tej was very preoccupied with tending to a
 very particular beehive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What could that be?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo without expecting for an answer that could be immediately understood.
 A few hours of meditation and friendly talk that made little or no sense
 had proved that Theo had some sort of natural aptitude in what Tej called
 Rho.
 At least, that's what Tej thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A barrier!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the giant bear with dramatic tension in his voice, only to finally
 give in and have a go at the bee hive with both paws, his massive teeth
 tearing it apart, consuming the glowhoney and the wax without a care.
 Swarms of bees escaped into neighboring hives, honey splattered the walls
 and whole hexagonal chunks of wax fell like debris towards space.
 Theo couldn't stop staring; it was as if something base had suddenly possessed
 the usually benevolent and kind ursine creature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pray you find another home, friends,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej and burped loudly.
 He then sent the small cloud of glowbees hovering about him away with a
 wave of his paw.
 He turned around and slowly walked towards Theo with his eyes closed; a
 perfect serenity covered his face.
 He sat down on the grassy floor next to Theo and sighed.
 A couple of minutes passed with nothing but the humming of the ever-present
 glowbees in the background to fill the silence.
 Tej simply sat there, breathing heavily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is something wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Theo.
 He allowed for a few moments; Tej usually took his time to provide what
 was supposed to be an answer, but Tej made no sound other than a thin,
 low, rumble.
 Theo leaned closer to the large mammal; the rumbling sound was coming from
 Tej's stomach.
 On closer inspection, better yet, it seemed like the great bear was snoring
 heavily, soundly asleep like a disropoptionately sized baby.
 Theo didn't know what to make of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sleeping?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he got up and asked right into Tej's ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was one hive! Just one!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried out the bear in anguish, shaking as if the nightmares stalked him
 in his wake still.
 Theo felt he should allay Tej's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's fine, Tejwel.
 I myself would've been tempted to eat a whole glowhoney-laden beehive if
 I were your size.
 It certainly would appeal to me since it seems to be so easy.
 And sweet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and nodded.
 Tejwel blinked fast only twice and realised he was awake once more.
 He felt his belly with both hands and looked at it as if something troubling
 was going to spew forth.
 At length he spoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is my weakness, my burden alone to carry.
 I sometimes lose control, I must confess.
 It is one of the reasons I still seek the end to my path.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think a little nap isn't that bad.
 It can be good for you, they say.
 I myself don't sleep much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo sounding like a confused, mentally challenged person.
 Tejwel smiled keenly and looked at the rushing stream of water while he
 talked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I meant the honey, dear Hanul.
 Once upon a time, I would've done anything for honey.
 Now, it is thankfully a rare thing.
 But still, when my spirit is troubled, I have this almost unquenchable
 thirst: a strange, powerful urge overpowers me.
 I lose myself in a sweet madness,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej, his huge paw covering half of Theo's backside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And the sleep? Is it fretful because of the guilt?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 That's because I overeat.
 We shall speak of this another time.
 I have an inkling about why my spirit is so troubled; it must be the same
 reason you do not seem able to ride the Rho,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej thoughtfully, his deep voice rumbling more than ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About that Rho, it couldn't by any chance be plain old magic? I'm supposed
 to be pretty good at magic, if not awesome by some accounts,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo with a thin grin.
 Tejwel's breath felt warm on Theo's face; it was followed by an austere,
 disapproving voice that hinted at violence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pride is death!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Tej and demanded Theo's undivided attention before he went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pride is a sin sweet as many but deadlier than most.
 Heed my words Hanul, for I have walked the prideful path and it is barbed
 and full of honey.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Everyone loves honey though,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Theo fearing the discussion would soon dissolve into one of Tej's
 cryptic monologues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You tell me, Hanul.

 the Rho flow around you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's not honey, is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Theo knowing it couldn't possibly be that simple, although it'd be
 nice for a change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 he said looking at his palms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 said Tej calmly and extended his paws.
 Theo sounded a little unsure, a bit worried and rather disappointed.

That doesn't sound right Tej.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

My paws.
 Touch my paws and free your mind friend.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I can do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo in a relaxed fashion and did so.

Now breathe.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 inquired Theo with a troubled brow.

\begin_layout Standard

Listen, Hanul.
 Listen to the wind blowing through this grove.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Theo did listen, or at least tried to.
 Tej's voice was becoming more shallow with every breath of his.

Don't think, Hanul.
 Go back.
 Breathe,

 Tej urged him.

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 there was urgency and purpose in the bear's gravely voice.

Father.

He's not there.

Look deeper.
 Stop breathing,

 said Tej with a commanding voice.

What?

 asked Theo perplexed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Stop breathing and listen to your mind's eye!

 said Tej with immense authority, his voice not unkind yet terrible to hear.

\begin_layout Standard

Listen! See! Feel! Don't breathe!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried the bear, and Theo felt compelled to do all that.
 There was no other way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The boy's long haired.
 I can only see his back.
 He's crying, I think.
 And..
 Blazes! It's Bo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

The realization struck Theo like a bolt in the chest.
 He wasn't sure if he felt like crying out of happiness or sorrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tej urged him for more.

He's turned into a rabbit! We're brothers! Me and Bo, we're brothers!

And what of the father?

A sudden, powerful vibration shook the grotto.

I never thought, I..

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Now empty that barrel of honey,

 said Tej and pointed the huge barrel of honey standing in the middle of
 the grove like an unwanted guest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? I don't think now is the time.
 I need to find the others.
 I need to find Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and got up, started to pace around the grove.
 Behind him, the whole mass of glowhoney rose up from the barrel and dispersed
 itself into hundreds of different little streams, each finding its own
 path through Tej's small maze and into an empty jar or vase to fill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

This wasn't a test, Hanul.

 He stood taller than the man sitting at the unremarkable table.
 The other man, in similar attire but with different insignia was quite

 asked Jimbo looking genuinely puzzled.
 The next moment, Tark's hand connected with the back of Jimbo's head with
 a violent chop.
 Jimbo crumbled on the wet, musky floor with a dull thud.
 Tark didn't waste a moment; he carried the unconscious Jimbo to a shadowy
 corner of the impromptu holding cell area.
 He bound his head and his feet together, and made sure to gag his mouth
 with a ragged piece of cloth that somehow stood out.
 He couldn't help but notice the weaving: it was an Elvish pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he was about to grab the crystal from the throne and leave, he saw Bo's

 Tark took a step back reflexively.

 he said surprised.
 Bo's eyes then flared up white hot before shooting a thick beam of blinding
 fire at the bars that held him captive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small cloud of evaporated metal rose from the bars and wafted harmlessly
 towards the exit.
 The rest of the bars were now a molten pool of metal, sizzling as they
 cooled off on the oak floor.
 Tark's eyes widened with restrained shock; he put one hand to his utility
 belt and went for an oddly shaped knife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just then that Bo jumped gracefully about four feet in the air as
 if his feet were nothing more than springs.
 Bo landed on Tark's shoulder who had neither the time, nor the capacity
 to turn the blade in his hand towards Bo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without so much as a squawk, Tark was doubly surprised when he felt a thin
 strand of whiskers, followed by a wet, pink sliver of lips touching his
 mouth.
 Bo had kissed him and then conveniently jumped off.
 Presently, the bunny rabbit sat at the table, eying Tark intently but without
 the characteristic flames that sprouted from its eyes.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 exclaimed Tark.
 Little did he care if he attracted the attention of the swarming neophytes,
 guards and mercenaries of the Ygg, milling about in the labyrinthous, bulk
 of the giant space-faring oak they had hollowed out and turned into a factory.
 All that, along with his up to that point successful infiltration felt
 like another life entirely.
 The single most important thing in his life at that moment was that a rabbit
 had kissed him on the lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still stunned in place and unable to comprehend, he heard a sweet melody

 The melody soon cleared up into a young woman's voice.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How is that possible?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo in his mind and suddenly her eyes flared up with a torrent of fire.
 Two tiny pulses of fire shot past Tark and landed on the face and chest
 of a hobgoblin who had just made an appearance at the exit, right behind
 Tark's back.
 Tark looked coolly at the slightly charred body which was lying face-first
 right beside him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Right.
 I guess you could tag along.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do not tag along.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the voice rang in his mind and as if to illustrate the difference, Bo hopped
 down onto the cave-like wooden floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Semantics.
 Don't lag behind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and shot a glance outside.
 The dimly lit corridor hewed into the wood looked clear.
 Tark nodded to Bo and stepped outside.
 Trying to look casual, Tark straightened his vermillion cap and picked
 what seemed to be a familiar direction.

I'm not inside a bunny.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Tark insisted.

You're some kind of spy, aren't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

One too many,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark agreed and nodded to himself even as he remained watchful while they
 passed through decrepit corridors and roughly hewn, splintered hallways,
 with little light to guide them other than a haze the color of the deep
 blue sea that seemed to linger everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What do you know about the crystal and the metal throne?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Bo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your friends, that crystal and the throne have certainly spurred quite an
 interest to the Ygg.
 That can't be good,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he whispered, stopped, checked the next intersection and moved along again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Those alien monsters you call the Ygg? We've faced one of their kind before,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and hoped alongside Tark fretfully.
 Tark replied while scanning the road ahead.
 It seemed like he was looking for some sign to find the right path.
 Somewhere along the corridor they were on, a swath of bright light seemed
 to emerge.
 He scoffed and whispered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And you survived? I might've been impressed if you weren't covered in fur.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I couldn't care less about your opinion, but the truth is it wasn't an easy
 encounter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo admitted as she hopped along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not supposed to be easy.
 Now just be silent.
 We're coming up on the vestibule.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am silent.
 You're the only one who can hear me.
 What's the vestibule?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The reason I'm here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whispered Tark almost inaudibly as they made a left turn on a slightly
 upwards sloped rough path.
 Brilliant orange light poured down on them.
 It didn't seem to be the usual torch light, roughly dispersed along the
 maze-like corridors they were walking through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what might that reason be?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked silently.
 No answer came until they reached the very end of their path, where a tiny
 ledge stood.
 It was so rough and sudden, that Bo nearly leapt off it.
 Once she stood there though, she really longed for her human body.
 She needed to gasp.
 Instead, her nose twitched while the vista filled her rabbit vision.
 Tark laid low on one knee and simply said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's wonderful, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and nodded.
 They were looking at the very core of the giant oak, a sparse, hollowed
 out expanse wide enough for a small city to fit from one end to another.
 Through the very center rose a sharp, multi-faceted crystal, shimmering
 with gold and silver, blue and white trailing lines like strands of heavenly
 hair wrapped around it.
 Concentric rings of pure white light seemed to hover in the air around
 the crystal; there was no end of them in sight.
 The crystal itself rose interminably high, lost in a blinding, twirling
 sea of white and blue, while at its very base a red and orange swarm of
 pulsating multi-coloured lights frothed inside a hazy, lava-like cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's incredible,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Bo inside Tark's mind, the awe transcribed as flawlessly as thought
 would allow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It will have to go,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tark, rose up and walked back down the path.

\begin_layout Standard
There was a cluster of eyes overlooking Parcifal as she sat at the bar,
 pensively withdrawn over a mug filled with a sizzling, steamy liquid.
 The bartender was apprehensive, at best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ye might wanna..
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 He swallowed hard and barely found it in his heart to finish his sentence.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal wasted no time; she downed the mug in one go.
 The wooden bar she was sitting at though in no pristine condition to begin
 with, was now filled with holes of varying sizes.
 At some places, there were even small holes through and through, even down
 on the floor.
 Around Parcifal, as if there was somehow an area of effect about her nearly
 three feet wide, sat no-one.
 In a place as packed as the `Long Distance Mariner', or El-dee-Em as the
 regulars called it, three feet was quite a wide berth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind her there was a pile of smashed, half-eaten mugs that was almost
 knee-high.
 A couple of rowdy fellows were passed out right beside the pile; they had
 insisted that Parcifal was in need of some `good ole barnacle busting'.
 Feeling gracious, Parcifal had only knocked them unconscious - most of
 their teeth had already been missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that tiny altercation, she had the El-Dee-Em's attention.
 It was a place rife with seadogs, roughnecks, hands-for-hire, pirate wanna-bees
 and space drifters, shady characters and sultry maids with less honor than
 a judge.
 Everyone of them couldn't help but stare at the feisty redhead clad in
 armor that seemed to have guts wrought out of iron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keep them coming,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and put some more coin on the bar for the bartender to see.
 For a moment, he stared at the coin before turning his gaze on Parcifal.
 He looked the sort of the old, retired pirate who had enough of a mind
 and a leg left after all the groggin' and the pillaging to settle down
 and go for the steady money of a sailor's bar.
 He had grey and white strands of long hair tied together and a thick moustache
 that made drinking beer a waste of good foam.
 His skin was worn over time and the trepidations of playing one's life
 on the line every day; but his eyes were an untouched sapphire blue and
 a shiny, pristine matter.
 There was a story going around that he had cried just once in his life,
 when his parrot died in a freak cuisine accident.
 This was only the second time then.
 His voice was an awed, trembling mess.

 he said and pointed with a white-knuckled, shaky finger at a tall drinking

 The expression on Parcifal's face remained that of a person wholly unimpressed.

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal let her words sink in like barbs.
 She seemed to be having immense fun.
 The bartender didn't seem to share that view, but nevertheless, he was
 grinning.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was suddenly glowing with a bright blue light, from her waist up.
 She looked at Encelados; even through the sheath, it was flaring bright,
 almost blinding.
 When she looked back upon the bartender, the same sapphire blue eyes were
 staring at her; but all the rest about him was a dark-skinned nightmare,
 very much like Hobb.
 A maw lined up with tentacles reached for her neck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the serenity of a monk and the speed of a mongoose, Parcifal moved
 out of the way with her eyes closed, her head drooped down.
 In one fluid motion, she unsheathed Encelados with her left arm and with
 an upwards sharp stroke she turned the blade against the tentacles and
 the creature's head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Milky-white blood sprouted for the neck of the once perhaps human bartender.
 Encelados was still filled with violent light, the thick liquid staining
 its otherwise immaculate surface.
 She then heard a sound like no-other; it was as if someone was stomping
 grapes made of glass.
 Parcifal's face showed some instinct other than self-preservationl; it
 was sudden, primal fear.
 She knew things would not be easy, but she wasn't prepared for this.
 Some more commotion; a number of thuds, a few croaks and the sound of flesh
 being robbed of life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She turned around in time to see more than half the El-Dee-Em's patrons
 on their last dying throes.
 Some were being choked by tentacles, others were already deadly surprised
 by a stab on the chest and most had found death while passed out drunk
 with their mugs in hand and their skulls cracked; brain matter oozed like
 a bag of spilled beans.
 The rest of the patrons had taken on their true forms; blue-eyed, tentacle-line
d maws, dark of skin, devoid of heart or goodness.

If you value your life, hand me over Bo the bunny, and the chair.

The monsters paused in their stride suddenly, no more than a dozen feet

 The Ygg that seemed to be their self-appointed leader spoke with a slightly
 trembling, quavery voice, filled with ghastly echoes of a hiss.
 It sounded like a deranged kind of laughter.

 Parcifal was already on the move, her senses helping her mind see her path
 against the threats all around her.
 The next moment, two severed clawed hands were still writhing on the murky,
 white-blooded floor; the Ygg shot its short tentacles in blinded agony.
 Parcifal leapt gracefully into the air, wielding Encelados with exemplary
 strictness of form.
 An eerie shriek filled the `Long Distance Mariner' - it sounded like the
 death throes of a stillborn sea giant.

 madness waiting at the other end.

 As she saw her whole field of vision being filled with the terrible forms

 of loneliness.
 Strangely, a flash of recollection overcame her.

Lemmy's was a bar situated at the very top of Tallyflop, built on a giant
 platform right on the rim of the oak's giant hollow main trunk.
 Surrounded by lush gardens, art carvings and statuettes, Lemmy's was a
 synonym for opulence.
 A stark contrast to the less refined and a lot slummier promenades of Tallyflop
, Lemmy's catered to the most expensive tastes and only the wealthiest of
 people could afford the establishment's fine services.
 That being said, its clientele consisted mainly of slavers, contraband
 traders, blockade runners, and the meanest, craziest cutthroats alive.

Little did the establishment's fame mattered to Wince while him and Lernea

The air was filled with the smell of stew; it rode aloft in the night air
 like a thick, sweet and sour delight.
 Ned had offered to cook; it was one of the few things he was familiar with
 ever since working alongside his father at the Sniggering Pig.
 As he stirred the broth in the pot, he couldn't help but throw a few glances
 at Judith's lithe figure sleeping a few feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first Judith had insisted cooking; she was worried that even up high
 on the tallest, farthest branches of the oak, under the cover of thick
 brush and leaf, with noone in sight a mile out, the tiny column of smoke
 from their campfire would attract unwanted attention.
 Ned had burst in laughter at Judith's overly paranoid seriousness, even
 though there was ample reason to be worried, even though she had saved
 his life.
 Ned's reaction had a curious effect on her; she had decided that getting
 some overdue sleep was more important than light discipline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just for good measure though, she'd quickly gathered some brush to cover
 up most of the fire.
 A small, wet piece of cloth was set up like a tent above the pot, to absorb
 some of the smoke.
 There were all sorts of small details she never seemed to stop paying attention
 to; her mind and body were in constant movement, never idle, always a step
 ahead.
 Ned couldn't help but marvel at her for all the right and all the promiscuous
 reasons.
 He was grinning like a dolt, mindlessly stirring the soup, his gaze fixed
 away into the distance, at the very lip of the treetop.

 She was already up and around, stretching her muscles, taking short, deep

 Ned turned his head around to answer and almost fell on his back, as if

 the other he tried to blindly propel himself back on the small log he had

 Then she realized that for some reason all the other, nudity was frowned
 upon where Ned came from.
 She could respect that; she put on the inner, linen suit of hers.
 It was a one-piece affair that kept the body warm or cool, depending on
 the need.
 She looked at the lip of the treetop; Lemmy's and the Elevator were visible
 on the large platform, as well as the narrow, three-mile long, corkscrew
 staircase that hugged the tree's bark all the way up to the top.

Judith turned away from the sight of the treetop.

 Where are you from, really? You don't seem well travelled.

How about the stew? It's not your first time cooking, I hope,

I'm not sure.
 I can only see so far into the future, it doesn't really matter what I

 For crying out loud, I'm sitting on a giant oak that's floating across

 said Ned earnestly and shrugged.
 He let out a little laugh, shook his head and looked around him.
 It was as if he still couldn't believe half of what was going on.
 Judith stared at him intently; she was measuring him, judging him, but
 not unkindly so.
 At length, she picked up her other sword and began sharpening it as well.
 She started to tell a story.

There was a time, not so long ago, that I wasn't all that different from

There's another red ember someplace near, and it's sitting smack in the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned as he raced to pick up his things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't know if we'll make it in time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said while she was suiting up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll have to find out then, don't we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned retorted, having already secured the line they'd come up with through
 his belt.
 Judith nodded silently and put on the rest of her leather suit with amazing
 speed.
 She picked up her swords, passed the thin, extremely strong line through
 a special kind of hook and looked at Ned meaningfully.
 As she was about to push off the ledge and start descending, Ned shot her
 a worried gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I just hope it's not Wince.
 I don't think I can stand his bragging if we survive this,

I still don't understand why we're doing this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea as they took the Elevator down.
 This time they were looking at the inside of the hollow oak; they were
 only then beginning to see the giant crystal core at its center.
 It looked like a massive block of strangely coloured ice, rising up, gorging
 its way as they travelled to the Heart of the Tree, where the meeting would
 be taking place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're doing this so I can snoop around while you're babbling, get Bo and
 the crystal and just butt out.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's the part of the plan I can safely assume everyone is familiar with.
 I'd like to know what it is we're supposed to be bargaining with,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea and Tej offered the critical detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

An offer they can't refuse; Hanul.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Who, me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo, surprised but not the least bit alarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It stands to reason, that whatever it is they hope to gain by using that
 crystal and holding Bo, they're missing a vital part.
 You, Hanul, are that missing part.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He is? I thought we were just going to sell those glum-faced rotten horrors

 Winceham said.

We are,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tej and smiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

So he's not really the missing vital part?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, Hanul is vital to their grand design.
 They just don't know it yet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand Tejwel.
 Why would we be giving them such an advantage? What if things go wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and shook her head with a furrowed brow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See? He does that all the time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo with a feeling of vindication.
 Tej placed his paws on Theo's shoulders.
 From afar, it looked like the huge bear was about to chew Theo's head off,
 but this wasn't the case.
 Light rose from below, hugging Tejwel's thick fur like a warm, reassuring
 blanket.
 The sight lent more than credence in his words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hanul, my friend.
 You must be ready when the time comes.

 wondered Theo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Let go,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tej said warmly.

Of what?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Theo said and shook his head.

I know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Tej and nodded to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then why do you do it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Because I must.
 And so shall you.
 When the time comes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You keep saying these things like I understand them already, but I only

 Just like when I touched your behinds.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea and Winceham instinctively sought each other's gaze; they looked
 like they were about to ask something, but thought better of it.
 Lernea scrubbed her face with her hands for a mere moment, and decided
 to pretend she hadn't heard.
 She closed her eyes and let herself sink in a deep, almost unbreakable
 concentration.
 Winceham on the other hand, was looking at Tej, focusing at his behinds.
 Seeing nothing but fur, he stroked his beard, nodded to himself and thought
 no more of the matter.
 Tejwel answered Theo with a rumbling, yet caring and somber voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I've seen the currents of time, Hanul.
 They'll carry you to brand new shores.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear smiled and looked again out through the Elevator's giant glass
 pane.
 The whole elevator was the size of a large room in a hexagonal shape.
 Held tight between brass and steel rails, it connected the very top of
 Tallyflop's giant oak to its very bottom and Tejwel's sanctum.
 No-one but Tejwel and the Rat had the keys that allowed its use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What currents of time, exactly? Where?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo and with an anxious pair of eyes started to search all around
 him with real purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, I'd say these are more akin to eddies in time, but that would've made
 things more complicated.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As I understand it, you have a more thorough understanding of Theo than
 he does himself,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commented Winceham.
 Lernea did not care for any of that; she was breathing heavily, meditating,
 preparing.
 Even as she stood upright, she looked more and more like a statue.
 The light from the crystal cast a tall, defiant shadow of her form.
 Her face was abnormally serene.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That might be more true than you think, Ham,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tejwel agreed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why do you do that thing with names?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham and Tejwel promptly provided an answer of sorts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Names, are only names; your name is not what makes you different from the
 rest of us, Ham.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not to mention a bruised groin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea suddenly cutting in.
 She was flexing her muscles; the cracking of air went along with her movements.
 A rather new sense of preparedness flashed accross her face; her eyes shone
 wildly.
 Winceham had seen that look before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Has anyone told you before that you bear a striking resemblance to your
 sister?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham told her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

My mother, actually.
 I bear a striking resemblance to our mother.
 Parcifal has our father's looks.

Tejwel, I can't seem to even catch a glimpse of those eddies in time.

Tejwel looked at Theo with a sorrowful gaze and smiled warmly.

There's not much of a plan now, Mr.

 said Lernea and smiled in a conniving, ruthless fashion as she fastened
 her chainmail gloves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I hope by talking, you do refer to exchanging words.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Naturally,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea without flinching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Elevator then began to slow down.
 They were fast approaching a ring of concentric, circular and hexagonal
 corridors that seemed to float of their own accord.
 They were connected by strands of thick, multicoloured light, wide enough
 for a man to walk on.
 It was as if a clockwork machine had been spilled carelessly in the air,
 yet still it was possessed of a natural order.
 At the very center of the rings stood the large, bright crystal; it was
 imposing, impervious to the eye.
 Layers of opaque matter glistened through mirror-clean surfaces.
 Irregular shapes and reflections dodged light and shadow in an equally
 mystifying way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the very first ring that stood strangely still and motionless, one could
 easily spot four menacing, dark-skinned figures, wearing plain robes.
 A shiny gem stood out on each one's forehead; it seemed to change its colour
 capriciously, like oil does on water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That's an impressive piece of glitter.
 I wonder how much it's worth,

 said Winceham, looking at the crystal as if he was mentally calculating
 how it could fit in his pocket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It defies calculation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tej with a gritty voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We could still sell it for less and make a profit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 grinned Winceham.
 His comment only made Lernea look at him disapprovingly.

Even Ned could've done a better job of a joke.

 The others, the charred, mangled ones, belonged to Ygg.

 Judith answered without turning to look around, her focus on the wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Because that's the last place where the eyeslab picked up Parcifal.
 Her body isn't here.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and the copper panel was pushed back with the loud click of a
 spring.
 She then slid it aside to reveal a passage hewn into the tree's bark, large
 enough for a tall man to walk unhindered.
 Faint amber light seeped through the far end.
\end_layout

Apres vous,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned whispered and followed close behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They remained silent for a length of time.
 The hollowed out part of the bark seemed to twist and turn roughly; it
 was as if whoever had opened the passage couldn't do so in a straight line.
 If it wasn't for the passage's walls, the faint light at the far end wasn't
 enough to guide them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they moved forward, the light became more intense.
 Then Judith stopped abruptly.

 he shouted excitedly and actually began to clap loudly.
 Judith looked at him with an exasperated look that meant she must've briefly

 Judith had no answer to such a question.
 Parcifal thought provided an answer to the main question at hand.
\end_layout

Having a good time with that lady friend of yours? I'm pretty sure she's

Oh, bugger!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned followed behind her at a slower pace, but now it was him who felt uneasy

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Who's that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked but Judith didn't reply.
 She simply shot past Parcifal who sidestepped at the last moment.
 Ned was next; she shot Parcifal an uneasy smile to which she replied with
 a heartfelt mocking grin.
 They were inside a small opening inside the bark, where a peculiar sort
 of lantern cast shadows against a man wearing some sort of uniform.
 A bunny was happily munching away on something that grew out of the floor.
 Two more passages seemed to lead to what looked like a whole network of
 corridors, deeper and deeper into the giant tree.

There's probably a lot to explain but very little time.

The Elevator came to a stop.
 The dimmed, darkened glass pane opened sideways, like a hatch.
 Directly in front of them, down three small steps, stood the Ygg representative
s, staring at Tej with cold, machinating, blue-on-blue eyes.
 Winceham was already plying his trade, unseen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Enginseer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the Ygg in unison; their combined voices sounded like a nest of insects
 through a metal reed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tej did not return the greeting.
 He simply walked outside the Elevator slowly, calmly.
 He did not return the Yggs' stares.
 The others followed close behind.
 Lernea grabbed Theo by one hand, and shoved him forward suddenly, treating
 him like one would a captive or a prisoner.
 Theo exclaimed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Watch it with that! It's a long drop and from what I've been though you

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shut it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said with vehemence and twisted Theo's arm just hard enough for
 him to remain locked in an awkward, sideways position.
 By the look on his face, he wasn't sure whether it was something he'd said
 that had gotten Lernea so mad or if this was just part of some sort of
 plan he vaguely remembered agreeing to non-verbally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said one of the Ygg and pointed vaguely at Theo with one webbed, clawed
 hand.
 Tej simply nodded with an austere look of barely contained anger on his
 face.
 One of the other Ygg shot an icy stare at Lernea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What of her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the Ygg asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The elf is mine to sell,

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Our mutual furry friend over here has a soft spot it seems for the fluffy

 she added, playing her part convincingly.

\begin_layout Standard

 said another Ygg and let out a dry cackle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tejwel with a crisp, embittered voice.
 But his stare was still hard as stone, set on the Ygg like a hound after
 its prey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What need do we have of this puny elf?

 asked the Ygg who hadn't spoken yet with a measure of impatience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That crystal in your possession; it is merely a trinket compared to what

 Lernea held Theo down who looked puzzled, trying to ascertain if he was
 indeed on sale and for what price.

That's impossible! The thaumaturgic readings on that mammal were off the

 There was little with which to distinguish them visually.

The rest of the Ygg nodded imperceptibly.
 Except for one.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Care to enlighten us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 growled Tej.
 Lernea tried to look the part handling Theo like a slave, but her eyes
 were already scanning the horizon for a sign that Winceham had done his
 part already.
 She felt like she was coming down with a peculiar nausea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But that is what it means,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and another ring platform appeared from below and locked into place
 behind their own.
 Two Ygg were standing on it, slightly bigger and uglier in appearance however
 impossible it seemed.
 One of them had Winceham tied on a rope; he was completely paralyzed, stiff
 as a piece of wood.
 His eyes were stuck wide open in terror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo, this is going to get really ugly, really soon,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea whispered to Theo, even though in the back of her mind she knew
 it didn't matter whether or not they listened to her anymore.
 She kept her calm and didn't appear shocked.
 Not even when the other Ygg dropped the pale, blood-robbed body of Rat
 at the platform, right behind the Ygg who did not seem to tolerate theatrics
 for long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There's nothing normal about this place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I was talking to my friend,

 Another one of the Ygg cackled profusely, the same as before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which reminds me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the Ygg with a tone of pure malevolence.
 The Ygg looked at Tej knowingly.
 Tej looked at Theo and told him with the faint trail of a single tear running
 down his furry cheek.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm returning to the light that bears us all, Hanul,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej right before a pulse of white fizzling light tore through his
 chest, spattering blood and bones in a burst and toppling the giant bear
 off the platform.
 Tejwel's form fell down below, into the whirring machine parts of the huge
 crystal silently.
 Reveling in the way his words produced hurt in Theo's face, one of the
 Ygg said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The larger they are, the easier they fall.
 Isn't that another piece of what you call popular wisdom? Such an infantile
 oxymoron.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo's face remained still.
 It looked like he hadn't really seen what had happened.
 Lernea had left her bow behind; all that she carried with was her ceremonial
 dagger.
 It was a dull little thing, fit for show and tell.
 But she clenched her teeth and appeared ready to meet whatever fate lay
 in store.
 The Ygg approached them like a cat approaches a fanciful toy.
 Lernea told Theo, in all seriousness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I find death at your side suits me well, Hanultheofodor.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What did you call me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked flatly, without emotion.
 He wasn't looking at her, nor the Ygg.
 He was still looking at where Tej had been standing moments ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hanultheofodor.
 Isn't that your full name?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just a name really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and looked at the Ygg that had come within a single step of him.
 The Ygg looked back and let an abyssal gleam filter through his eyes; its
 tentacles writhed expectantly.
 Abruptly, the writhing stopped.
 Theo's eyes were closed, his arms extended.
 A vein throbbed on his head.
 He began to tremble.
 And so did the Ygg; all of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood motionless.
 Then she began to shake as well.
 Theo was floating a few inches above the surface of the platform.
 His face was drenched in sweat; his dreadlocks stood up in a bizarre, disconcer
ting fashion.
 He looked like a terrible, wrathful figure; not the timid, somewhat kludgy
 sorcerer other people usually saw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ygg struggled to move, to react; all that remained was a terrible realisatio
n in their eyes.
 The gems in their foreheads flickered with intensity; slowly their bodies
 drifted off the platform seemingly of their own accord.
 But Lernea knew that it was Theo that somehow did all that.
 She then felt the platform sway and start to gyrate oddly.
 Another tremor shook the world around her.
 She heard a terrible raucous of a thunder reverberating from deep below.
 Winceham, released from the Ygg's embrace fell on the platform's surface
 hard.
 It was the third time that day his tenderlies had received unwanted attention
 from blunt objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This can't be normal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she whispered and was surprised to hear the voice of Theo flood her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing will ever be again, Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 his voice said and the Ygg were flung with blinding speed across the hollowed-o
ut space.
 It looked as if some being of immense power had pulled a sinister set of
 strings with all its might.
 Their bodies had become small affairs on a distant wall, white murky blood
 smearing it like a blotch of ink on paper, only every colour reversed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So that's how it feels,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo as he settled himself down, panting not from the exertion, but
 from a rampaging, burning sensation in his mind; he felt hate for the first
 time in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand what it is that I just saw.
 But this is not good.
 At all,

 instead of her bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It is what is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo brusquely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm talking about them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and pointed at the hundreds of Ygg pouring out from every recess
 and crevice around the inner bark.
 They filled the platform rings and rushed Theo and Lernea.
 Some were cradling ornate weapons spawned out of nightmares, others simply
 flew with all their might across the distance, screeching in their nameless
 voices, a single name:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Shubb-naur! Shubb-naur!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The huge crystal formed a crack on its outer layer; the rings had fallen
 out of sync.
 Everything appeared to be breaking apart.
 A terrible grinding noise had risen up from the very depths of the crystal
 assembly and it wouldn't die down.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Noone dies!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted a voice above the din.
 Lernea looked behind her and saw Ned sweeping inches above her head only
 to grab Winceham in his arms a moment or so later.
 Not to far behind, a comfortable height up, a small, sleek twin-hulled
 ship floated elegantly amidst the crumbling chaos of the infernal crystal
 machine.
 Layers upon layers of crystal began to crack and shatter, giving off blinding
 amounts of light followed by scalding heat waves at random.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Throw me a line!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Lernea.
 Just as she had finished her sentence, she saw a strange-looking thin blunderbu
ss firing off without ever seeming to be in need of reloading.
 It cut down the first lines of the Ygg with an outrageous hail of fire.
 But they would not double back.
 Even as the world around them became undone, it was as if a higher zeal
 compelled them to bring ruin to those that dared take the Ygg for fools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hasten thee, sister!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 came back a loud answer; it was Parcifal, benting over the ship's rail

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you drop a line?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted back Lernea.
 Theo looked as if he wasn't aware of what was actually happening.
 Then as if he had a sudden moment of enlightenment, he sprang at Lernea
 without a care, ignoring the bright white shots of deadly light the Ygg
 were throwing at them.
 The floating ship wobbled slightly as a series of cannonshot sprayed havoc
 amongst the ranks of the Ygg.
 But still, they came.

Theo fell on Lernea and threw her a couple of feet away right when she was
 just about to catch the line they'd thrown for her.
 She was about to start shouting obscenities she would have found quite
 distasteful herself, when a huge piece of rock smashed the ring platform
 in two, right at the spot where she was standing a moment earlier.
 Theo held her hand as they both slid off the platform and started falling
 down into a blazing inferno that seemed to rise with every beating heart.

Ned saw them, as did Parcifal; but they were helpless, frozen in disbelief.
 Tark shouted by himself, while no-one had asked him:

Then Bo's eyes flared up with fire suddenly; the next moment Bo the Bunny
 leapt off the ship as everything around them began to look like thick grains
 of sand, sliding away into a sea of fire.
 The Ygg were lost in vortex of fire and ruin, chanting as they fell into
 oblivion.

 She fell on her knees, and letting go, she began to wail with every drop
 of her soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark led the ship on a steep upward course with a speed that no ordinary
 ship could handle; everyone had to hang onto something.
 As they shot up and away from the cataclysmic ruin, there was a bright
 blue flash of light like a broken piece of glass shimmers in the sun.
 Then every platform, every ring and piece of crystal along with all the
 Ygg was engulfed in flames.
 Bursts of lightning flared away and the sound of doom ripped past them
 like a howling tide.
 Ned caught a glimpse of that blue flash; all he knew was it looked out
 of place, even in a mess like that.
 In his heart, nothing was certain.

Even Tallyflop looked like it was still standing though battered and shaken;
 all its lights were out and not a merry song could be heard.

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was sobbing on Judith's shoulder with as much dignity as a princess
 of Nomos could muster.
 Judith found the feeling strange; she wanted to comfort Parcifal.
 She was ashamed to find out she had forgotten how.
 She simply hugged her and felt the tremors against her chest.

Tark had lit up a pipe, and was sharing it with Winceham who was still in

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a sinister threat lurking in the cosmos.
 It is a dark, sticky as tar and far worse than moldy cheese.
 It reaches in places you would never believe or feel comfortable with;
 its livid tendrils sneakily out to get everything that's fair and beautiful
 around us, even unicorns.
 I must do as my conscience bids me; I must fight to expose their ill-doings
 and bring them down once and for all.
 There's a lot of danger involved which means I'll probably die or go mad
 in the process.
 But I have to do this, for the sake of my children alone.
 And perhaps all the things I find dear in the world, like Taem berries.
 And roast veeb.
 Perhaps, Rovenii mead and Yule beer as well.
 Just thinking about what is at stake here, makes me ravenous.

\begin_layout Quotation
-- Athmoor Radaniel, from his personal journal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea felt her face set against something wet and grainy.
 As if caught in the moment between wakefulness and sleep, her mind felt
 numb, soft and muddy.
 A word popped in her head: Sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wet sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her face was half-buried in a patch of wet sand.
 There was a feeling of cold water splashing against her body every now
 and then.
 Maybe it was time to go to the latrine she thought to herself, but quickly
 realised it was the feeling of waves embracing her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A beach then, she came to realise and opened her eyes half-expecting everything
 to be a dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no silken bedding around her, no morning sun's glory behind laced
 curtains; just a misty, fog-laden beach with low, crumbled rock outcroppings
 in the hazy distance which wasn't much of a distance at all.
 The sun was hidden behind a grim overcast sky.
 Lazy grey clouds barely seemed to move.
 A harsh, cold salty breeze made her face flush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw the white bunny rabbit to her right, the way her head lay; Bo was
 munching on a small brush of salt-weed when she looked her way as if enabled
 by some sixth or even seventh sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good, you're awake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words rang crystal clear in Lernea's head; she was instantly confused.
 It was a woman's voice, warm and cheerful.
 Her first thought was she had either bumped her head somewhere along the
 way or had gone mad.
 Voices in her head were more than she could cope with - it was the worst
 time to check her sanity levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's alright.
 It's me, Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said while Bo munched away, seemingly possessed by a real appetite
 for destroying salt-weed bushes.
 Lernea squinted at the bunny with a puzzled, weary look.
 For all she knew and cared for, a talking bunny made as much sense as a
 magical, fire-spouting one.
 What felt weird was Bo appeared to be female.
 That wasn't a life-threatening situation, Lernea knew; she'd just come
 out of one alive and well.
 And quite wet, she added as an afterthought.
 She sighed and suddenly wished for a steamy hot cup of Chamoleon: she could
 almost smell it too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised her head slightly above the wet sand and felt a sudden, awful
 dizziness.
 She remembered the drop into that churning nightmarish fire and the flash;
 a bright, blinding flash.
 She remembered Theo falling right behind her, clasping her hand and Bo's
 eyes flaring up as as if the small white bunny would explode with a hail
 of brimstone and fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She dug her hands in the sand and propped herself up; her shoulders felt
 sore.
 She looked to her left and saw Theo laying there, his back against a patch
 of damp sand with arms splayed and eyes closed, where the waves would barely
 lick his body.
 Her mind flashed with a horrifying thought; she felt her stomach tie itself
 in a knot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He's just sleeping.
 He was actually snoring a little while back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo sent to her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can read minds now as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Lernea audibly, with just the right amount of annoyance in her
 voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, it's not that hard to tell what crossed your mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and dug her rabbit body under a rocky ledge where the wind seemed
 to die down and sat there snugly.
 Lernea replied with a stare and a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She drove a hand through her hair reflexively; it was a ragged mess with
 pieces of seaweed clinging on like little green braids.
 Her leather bodice was soaking wet and her boots made squishy sounds.
 She felt wet and miserable, her only measure of relief the reassuring weight
 of her bow strung against her back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aren't you cold? At all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo asked her timidly; her little bunny body shivered involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am the rightful Queen of Nomos, the Kingdom of the North,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied in a stern voice.
 She felt better just by saying that.

So, you're accustomed to this cold, I take it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Actually, Theo is my brother,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and even in Lernea's mind her voice had an awkward feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised an eyebrow and took a long, hard stare at Bo.
 Then she shook her head and looked at Theo, silver-haired with a touch
 of blond, the wet, ragged dreadlocks adorning his elven face with all the
 grace of a mop.
 She burst out laughing.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo's words nearly made Lernea's mind feel a bit heavier with all the weight
 the voice carried suddenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea blinked furiously as if something were caught in her eye.
 Her face became taut suddenly; she stared back at the sea like a castaway
 waiting for a ship that'd never sail by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned.
 And Parcifal.
 They're not here, are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and walked over to Theo, vague molds of her boots trailing behind
 her on the impressionable sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Neither is Winceham,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo voiced.
 Lernea shot her a frowned look and paused mid-stride.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The weird, short fellow.
 Don't you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked with a hint of worry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin, really.
 I remember.
 I'm not really sure what exactly happened, that's all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat down beside Theo, legs crossed.
 Locks of her hair were stuck against her face.
 She looked to windward, her arms laid back against the sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want the short version, or the long version?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wager we're not in a hurry.
 If someone wanted us dead, they'd done it by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shouldn't we wake Theo up as well? He might want to hear all this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added as an afterthought.
 Bo twitched her nose and hopped towards the sea, soaking her bunny feet
 in some wet sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He gets a bit antsy if you wake him up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said in Lernea's mind.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's kind of groggy and slow-minded for a while afterwards,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added and backed away playfully from a slightly frothing wave.
 Bo seemed to be having some kind of fun, despite it all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For a while? Like what, a whole day?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a sneer.
 Bo turned her bunny head uncannily towards Lernea; her eyes seemed to brighten
 up a little - it was a reflex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, that's not nice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she sent to Lernea's mind; there was some sadness involved, rather than
 anger.
 Lernea looked at Bo for a moment and closed her eyes.
 Right beside her, Theo could be heard, snoring lightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean it like that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and awkwardly ran a finger in the sand, drawing random curves
 and shapes.
 Bo seemed satisfied; the bunny's eyes lost their glint and she turned to
 look at the sea once more, her head bobbing slightly as if mesmerized by
 the waves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's true though, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said after a while.
 The bunny looked at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he can be a little daft sometimes.
 But he did save us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and hopped merrily towards Theo and snuggled right beside his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He did? I thought that was you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied, genuinely surprised to hear that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried, but there wasn't much I could do other than put a shield around
 us.
 The wormhole that brought us her in the nick of time, that was Theo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a while, Lernea stared at Theo as if in shock.
 The sound of waves dying a few feet away rose easily above the eerie silence.
 Bo blinked at Lernea without saying a word.
 Overhead, a sea bird of some kind croaked.
 It drew Lernea's stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was goofy with magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh, whatever he did, trust me; it wasn't magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo said and wiggled her nose.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo is magically inert.
 Has been ever since I can remember,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the bunny said and dug its face in Theo's sand-ridden dreadlocks, before
 pulling it out again sharply - as if it smelled something unruly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was a sorcerer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He seemed to be; well, kind of.
 Sometimes at least,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added shrugging, sounding clearly confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 I just made it appear so; I'm the sorceress in the family,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and her bunny eyes flared up with a tinge of red flame that was
 snuffed out the next instant, just to illustrate her point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just for appearances?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked.
 Bo leapt above Theo's slowly rising and falling chest and perched herself
 on top of a mass of rocks.
 She stood straight up and looked around, surveying the misty landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin knew.
 I have a soft spot for Theo, what can I say? I thought it was prudent as
 well.
 Magical bunnies aren't a dime a dozen - if word got out..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo let the words echo faintly in Lernea's mind.
 She gave Bo a weird squinting look - it was her calculating, thinking look.
\end_layout

 Bo sent to Lernea and paused, sniffing the air.

Hide.
 That's all I can remember.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I can relate to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a shallow voice.
 Her face flushed red, remembering how she and Parcifal were cast out, humiliate
d, to be excised from memory, from history even.
 As they never had existed.
 She bit her lip and her mind turned to the quandary at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Then how did he do whatever it was he did that saved us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea asked and pointed at Theo, looking baffled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The wormhole? I haven't got the slightest idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo said and uncannily shook her head slowly like a human would.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Same goes about the place we've ended up at,

 she added, her nose twitching faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It could've been worse,

 Lernea said and stood up.
 A cold breeze snapped against her hard, lean face.
 She felt invigorated.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We could have been charred to the bone or flash-steamed into space, that's

 generally green and edible.
 She sniffed profusely, like only a sort of herbivore hound would.

What's homely about this cold, wet place? I can barely see what's out there.

Lernea nodded and then frowned.
 A lady, even in the guise of an animal, that admitted to making vulgar

A ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied and put a hand above her eyes, searching for a sail, a mast,

 The creaking grew louder; it was as if the ship was riding past them.
 Theo's light snoring could not hope to match it.

Then a giant shadow carved itself through the mist with alarming speed.
 A dark wooden bulk in the shape of a ship's prow appeared, accompanied
 by a creaking noise and the sound of foaming, rustling water.

Move!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo managed to sent with a gasp to Lernea and Theo both, while the ship
 ran aground heedlessly, kicking up wet sand violently all around its prow.
 No-one had time to move, but nevertheless the ship came to a jarring, abrupt
 halt with a grinding noise reminiscent of millstones and sliding tomb doors.
 Nobody was hurt, but they nonetheless couldn't pry their eyes of the ship's
 prow.
 There was a bronze-and-marble statuette of a luscious half-gorgon, half-mermaid
 decorating it.
 It was voluptuously sculpted, sexually suggestive and quite terrible to
 behold.

 leather and skin.

 said a scruffy-looking old man that appeared by the ship's railing.
 He was wearing what appeared to be more than a slightly used horned metal
 cap on his head and a tattered old shirt and pants of an indiscriminate
 nature and original color.
 A rather musky old beard hung from his face down to his waist; what looked
 like tiny barnacles clung on strands of it, as if their life depended on
 it.
 There was a wooden parrot that appeared physically and permanently attached
 to his shoulder.
 It was also quite emphatically dead, judging as it didn't breathe nor move.

 Bo whispered in her mind, even if there was no real need to do so:

There was a slight hint of paranoia right there; if the Ygg had reached
 out wherever this place was, Lernea thought to herself, their agents would've
 realised who they were talking to by now.

 Ygg, they were indeed a sad, hopeless, desperate lot.

 Lernea said aloud to make sure the old pirate would hear.

 He nodded to himself, shrugged and said to no-one in particular:

 It splashed into the sea audibly with a plop.

Parcifal's stare had the quality of solid ice; it was cold and opaque.

 Parcifal replied icily and staring blankly at the rosy-red sky.
 Thick, puffy clouds passed them by, while below them a green tapestry inched

 Roads and bridges, the roofs of houses small and big.

 Tark said trying to smile thinly, his words carefully selected and his
 voice pitched so as to get the message through in a nice yet slightly irritated

 Ned interjected, seeing the first signs of a discussion evolving into a
 fight.
 And Ned knew there had been more than one on their way to Pi Gamma Mu,
 a reasonably peaceful planet of the Human League.
 The fights usually involved Parcifal and Tark, and they were mostly resolved
 before anyone got physically hurt by either Ned or Judith.
 Winceham was either sleeping, having a smoke, or not having a bath most

 His decidedly neutral disposition had earned him a sort of invisible attribute

 he added and turned his back on everyone without another word.
 Parcifal remained silent, unperturbed.
 Her mind was fixated on what really mattered; the whereabouts and fate
 of her sister.
 She knew Lernea was alive, that much she felt as well.
 But where, and for how long, she couldn't answer.
 Those uncertainties gnawed at her soul; it wasn't good for her disposition
 either.
 There was a constant ire, an anger at everything and everyone.
 What she wouldn't freely admit but knew in her heart, was that she blamed
 herself, more than anything.
 After all, she was still a princess of Nomos, Captain of the Guard.
 She had failed her queen, putting her in harm's way.

 Parcifal's gaze did not follow her.

Ned was conversing with Tark in a low voice; Winceham was sitting comfortably
 at a swiveling, puffy chair, his feet resting at the helm proper.
 The helm moved and rocked as Winceham shuffled his legs, but the ship stayed
 on course.
 That's because the helm, though operational, didn't really do much.
 The ship was an advanced design; among the many utilities and assorted
 paraphernalia, the mysterious thingamajigs and spurious artifacts it carried,
 it was equipped with an autothaumagator, a device that supposedly served
 many purposes, but which it's primary function was to navigate the ship
 safely and without any crew assistance whatsoever.

Was that supposed to be a witty play on words?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir, we're approaching Rampatur,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and stood there waiting for instructions.
 Tark nodded and his eyes scanned the horizon momentarily, before his eyes
 met the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the white towers and glistening prisms that made up the core of
 Rampatur City were growing closer.
 Like a miniature set built with extreme detail, Rampatur City looked nearly
 perfect and almost fake.
 Yet it was real enough; stretching across both sides of pristine river,
 it a sprawling metropolis with a distinctive melt of architecture from
 many different schools, from almost every part of the Human League.
 A large, tall pyramid-like structure dominated the center of the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stood there wide-eyed, wonderfully fascinated at the rich white, grey
 and golden hues reflecting the mellow green and brown countryside surrounding
 the city.
 He couldn't stop staring; his lips curled in a grin.
 The sight of the approaching city even attracted Parcifal's parsimonious
 stare, but she didn't break her silence.
 She simply stood there, unable to contain the fact that her interest was
 indeed piqued.
 Ned, on the other hand sounded openly ecstatic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What a sight! It's so grandiose.
 So majestic!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just a backwater planet's capital.
 It's quite rustic, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a scoff.
 He then turned and faced the helm abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ship, send a hail message to the Directorate Office.
 Be sure to include the word `pumpkin', capitalized.
 Negotiate a mooring with Rampatur Aerial and bring us in for landing.

 Tark said with some mild annoyance.

Stimulate,

 the ship repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Never mind.
 Find an exorbitantly-priced restaurant.

 Tark said raising a finger.

\begin_layout Standard

 Ned asked him.

 confused look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and his answer sounded a lot like a question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you reserved a table for five.
 Does that mean you're offering a night out? Like a welcoming gift?

 Ned said smiling a bit awkwardly, always a polite smile on his lips.
 He could see Parcifal fidgeting uncomfortably near the ship's prow, as

Good gracious, no!

 Tark exclaimed with a polite little laugh.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would've been impertinent to say the least.
 Quite frankly, whatever gave you that idea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark was looking at Ned from head to toe; what Ned implied sounded almost
 absurd.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I've been in the field for months.

\begin_layout Standard

Judith will handle your lot.

What does that mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It means you need to co-operate and everything will be fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squinted as he gazed towards the city, a hand over his eyes.
 From the right point of view, the setting sun did not blind but rather
 painted the round-topped towers with a rosy, pinkish sheen.
 Ned's answer came with a heavy, slow nod of his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll co-operate alright.
 Just as long as we're treated fair and proper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and made sure to stress the last word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What about her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and pointed at Parcifal, looking at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal is strong-willed and proud.
 She's like a hurt, caged animal right now.
 You never know when she might lash out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and shrugged.
 Tark took him by one shoulder and nearly whispered in his ear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As a word of advice, don't act the fool with Intelligence.
 You're not Human League citizens; you'll be granted a provisional status

\begin_layout Standard

How do you mean? What kind of trouble?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said sounding alarmed and rightly so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You see he's humanoid, not human standard.

 Tark said and raised an eyebrow.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not the official take on the matter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned slightly around to see Parcifal; it appeared as if
 he was checking up on her.
 He saw Judith was busy making last minute checks to her inventory, all
 neatly stacked and tied down to the deck.
 Ned's voice was filled with sudden angst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It would have been pointless, really.

 Tark replied with a smug little grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

And now there is? Treating halfuins like aliens.
 Aren't there any short people in the Human League?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's an entirely different subject.
 I don't make policy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squatted, reaching for a metal box near the helm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're on the clock.
 I'm doing you a great favor just by letting you know.
 It could get me into a lot of trouble.
 Lose my job, get shot.
 I'm talking that kind of trouble,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sounded positively serious even though the grin would not leave
 his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You won't buy us dinner, but you're willing to risk getting shot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's not get all chummy all of a sudden,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised one finger with one hand while he rummaged inside
 the metal box with the other.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dinner is one thing; getting shot is a professional perk anyway.
 I like to think of it as extending a little bit of professional courtesy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said looking up to Ned with a smile.
 In his hands he held what looked like a small backpack or rather a large
 bag with straps and whatnot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I'm a performer.
 You're a..
 Spy, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked with a good measure of uncertainty.
 To his knowledge, spies were vermin-like people, all cloak and dagger that
 you'd never guess in a million years what they did for a living.
 On the other hand, Tark was practically shouting it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Things seldom are the way they appear to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and perfunctorily gave the bag a look.

You're not a spy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Are you seriously expecting me to answer that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said while wearing the bag on his back.
 It was black and somewhat rotund.
 A pair of red lines made of stitches ran its length; they were made to
 look like lightning.

It doesn't look tailor-made,

 Ned said and made a sour face of disbelief.
 Tark replied without hinting at any sort of being annoyed or indeed being
 called a retard.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, what does it do?

 Ned asked, voicing some genuine interest in what appeared to be little

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned asked conversationally.
 He shrugged vaguely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Oh, there's no magic involved.
 It's a simple aetheric device.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

That's what the big-heads in VV-section told me, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied, fastening a pair of straps around his waist.
 Ned's gaze seemed drawn to the retardation device.
 After a couple of moments of scrutiny, Ned asked poignantly with one hand
 resting under his chin, to add even more thoughtfulness into his words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What if that fails?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There's always religion, I'm told,

 Tark said and walked past Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked him with a tint of curiosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to jump,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and made a jumping gesture with both hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were coming along,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and took a few steps closer to Tark, with his hands crossed over
 his chest.
 He was pouting slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, no.
 I'm not even supposed to be on this ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said grinning profusely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

So, you're hiding as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hiding is a harsh term.
 Obfuscating one's whereabouts is much more preferable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It still means you're hiding.
 Winceham will be forced to go into hiding as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Look, I really need to jump.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I need you to do me a favor,

 Ned said and touched Tark on the shoulder, smiling lightly.
 Tark noticed the gesture and sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is strictly business.
 Nothing personal to all of this, do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned his back on Ned.
 He grasped the railing and was preparing to really jump overboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Ned said, tapping Tark's shoulder profusely.

Sweetness of a maiden's tit! What is it now?

 Tark yelled with aggravation.

His backpack,

 Ned said with a beaming smile.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark asked, looking at the backpack's straps mundanely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Misdirection, mostly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said as if it should have been obvious.
 Tark stepped away from the railing and took off the backpack.
 He opened it hastily and found nothing but a half-eaten mushroom salad
 sandwich along with a note that read:

\begin_layout Standard
The ship was the Mary Drunkard; a twelve-gun fast runner, light and deadly
 as a hawk when it first was put to sea.
 Three hundred and twenty three years later though, it was a small miracle
 or perhaps even a feat of magic that vessel still remained afloat.
 Anyone who could afford a bit of common sense would have bet an arm and
 a leg that a ship filled with gaping holes and made out of maggot-infested,
 rotten wood would happily sink away like a rock.
 The few unlucky souls who made those kinds of bets gave a small bump in
 the always-in-demand, but never-really-breaking-it-big, prosthetics industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original owner, a rich eccentric drunkard that liked to spend his vast
 wealth in pointless exotic travels and self-inflicted adventures, had indeed
 named the ship in one his drunken binges.
 If one were to judge by the way it teeter-tottered ungainly as it tried
 to navigate the unbudging fog, it was very fitting name indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked skeptical, while Theo sported a withdrawn expression, thoughtful
 to the point of weariness.
 It had everything to do with the game-board he was glued to, its multi-colored
 tiles and many pieces too much for the untrained eye.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What if..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea suggested at one point and inched a finger closer to one piece.
 Theo stopped her in her tracks with a single, wild-eyed glance.
 She drew her hand back onto her lap, where Bo sat, her bunny eyes going
 back and forth between Theo and the captain, as if a tiny spark was all
 that was needed to ignite a deadly silence into a veritable mayhem.
 But all they were doing was sitting comfortably around a table, sipping
 some tea and playing Po.

What kind of game would that be, lad?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Captain Van der Breckenrod asked with an abruptly aroused suspicion, holding
 his chin up; the pipe in his mouth followed suit and remained stuck upwards
 as it glowed, ember-red after he drew heavily on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Po,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Theo without skipping a beat or breaking his concentration.
 The Captain looked around him for a moment, looked at the table and let
 the smoke out of his nostrils.
 A small cloud hovered between him and Theo before he finally rolled his
 eyes and as if waking from a dream, fluttered his eyelids and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Of course, Po!

Bo fidgeted and couldn't sit still.
 She had been growing more and more nervous by the minute.
 She voiced to Lernea and Theo, for their minds alone:

He suspects something.
 He knows.
 Who knows what kind of plan he's hatching, who he's working for.
 We're in grave danger!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea tried to control her breathing; her face jerked slightly, involuntarily,
 as if something had bitten her.
 She picked up Bo and looked her in the eyes, those wonderfully red-hued
 bunny eyes with the propensity to spout fiery wrath when she was provoked.
 Bo looked rather adorable in her fluffy white bunny form, and Lernea was
 a young woman of noble heart, scion to a kingdom and very lady-like, good
 and proper in her manners, just and swift with her bow.
 But she was an inch closer to actually breaking the bunny's neck, and Bo
 could feel she was at the edge of a chasm.

Let's just say, for the sake of argument, you were afraid, for some reason
 - well-founded or not - afraid a particular set of events might occur in
 the future.
 Like taking an arrow to your knee that prevented you from living the life
 of an adventurer.
 Or some stranger you just met was awfully weird and had really bad bladder
 control on top of a drinking problem that made you suspicious of him.
 That man would not constitute a let's say, clear and present danger against
 your person, without showing overt aggressiveness in the form of killing
 you outright, in your sleep, or at least trying to throw you overboard
 to the killer whales now.
 In which I would be more than happy to do something about it to the best
 of my ability.
 Seeing though, as there isn't any evidence to support such a claim, I would
 be remiss to not point out that going on and on about a hypothetical situation
 without any basis on reality \SpecialChar \-
 bent as it may be under certain circumstances
 \SpecialChar \-
 can drive a person mad.
 It would thus be, by any account, not unlikely for a person under duress
 to be driven into acts of temporary insanity as can be proven under law,
 to which extent said person might not be held liable for his actions and
 be set free.
 Wouldn't you agree, overall, gentlemen?

 Lernea said without tearing her eyes away from Bo who sat perfectly still,
 soaking in what was mostly intended for her ears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Captain Van der Breckenrod looked at Lernea sideways for a moment and then
 looked at the glass in his hand.
 There was a little tiny piece of handicraft floating in it, an umbrella
 \SpecialChar \-
 or some would argue, a parasol \SpecialChar \-
 and it was slowly sinking in the dark,
 cherry red mixture of unidentifiable alcohol and rum.
 He downed the glass in one go, frowned heavily for a while, checked the
 bottom of the glass for signs of more liquor and then turned and told Lernea,
 the tiny umbrella still stuck on his beard:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I, for one, Miss Testarossa, am agreed.
 I am quite agreeable a person, after all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and threw away the tiny umbrella with the intention of sending
 it overboard.
 Instead, it somehow flew around in circles and settled on Theo's hair,
 who was too preoccupied with planning his next move to afford the most
 perfunctory of looks.
 He did nod though, but only to himself in relation to a possible move he
 was contemplating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's quite alright, Mr.
 Van der Breckenrod.
 Silence is after all, a common indicator of approval.
 Isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and Bo seemed to nod imperceptibly.
 She remained silent indeed, and almost looked prudish somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, if my crew is any indication, you are spot on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the old pirate said and raised his glass.
 It was pretty soon floating mid-air in the direction of the ramshackle
 captain's cabin.
 Lernea had noticed a lot of that was going on around the ship; sails hoisting
 themselves, ropes being tied up as if by way of magic, giant waterproof
 holes in the hull.
 Yet it had nothing to do with magic, or else Bo would have at least a real
 possible threat to take into account.
 It had to do with ghosts and Theo was the only who could not just see them
 but talk to them as well.
 It had something to do with Rho, the ever-present life force of sorts that
 existed in everything living.
 Somehow, that even involved the undead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still, a skeleton crew, no pun intended.
 How do you manage?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea asked and put Bo down on the deck.
 Her voice was weary, but noticeably calm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the captain said while scanning the board of Po with a squinted gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, it's just you and what was it, three ghosts?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and Theo nodded reassuringly to her.
 He had made his move and thus was now aware of what was Lernea was saying.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've been lost at sea for fifteen years.
 Don't you find it, taxing? I mean, isn't there a home you'd like to be

Ah.
 I've made the sea my wife and mistress; the ship is my home, and the bottom

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the captain said nodding.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sometimes though, I do wake up and see what's for breakfast and I wish I
 were dead, yes.
 But then I'm reminded I might end up as ghost crew in a ghost ship and
 I just know the kind of heartless bastards that run those ships,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and gave the main mast an angry, crazed stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That brings me back to my senses,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and took a swig from his pipe before moving a pawn shaped like
 an extravagantly built windmill to a blue tile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and reshuffled himself in his seat.
 He was rather more quiet than his usual self.
 He hadn't raised many questions since he had woken up, and he had made
 no mention of Tejwel, the bear involved in whatever that thing they blew
 up in Tallyflop was.
 Theo must've thought him a real friend indeed, judging by the way he so
 easily and quite impressively killed the Ygg as if they were nothing more
 than monsters.
 It had certainly had some effect on him; he suddenly appeared grim and
 boring, all grown-up.
 Even the game they had been playing seemed utterly drab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is interesting exactly? I haven't heard of this game before.
 All I see is a mosaic of tiles on an irregularly shaped board, and lots
 of different pieces made out of practically anything solid.
 Not to mention you've been playing for four hours straight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat up straight in the utilitarian stool.
 She produced a comb out of a small vest pocket, and began combing her hair.
 Apart from not doing much to rectify the sad affair that her hair had been
 reduced to, the combing had the deleterious effect of grains of sand falling
 onto the game-board with a rasping, cluttering sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could you do that someplace else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said while the captain extended a hand blindly to receive his flying,
 refilled glass of the cocktail he was drinking, complete with a tiny umbrella
 and everything, up to and including a slice of pineapple.
 Lernea looked at Theo and noticed his stare wasn't the usual bland-eyed
 stare he seemed to confront the world at large with; it had a purpose and
 a hint of ire this time.
 She stopped combing her hair and apologized, though she hadn't expected
 anyone to notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 seemed to nod the way the old pirate made a vibrant gesture with his hands,
 roughly shaping up a sphere in the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought games were supposed to be fun,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was looking at the pirate intently, ears standing
 tall and upright like antennae.
 Though she remained silent, Lernea felt she was ready to absorb everything
 the captain was saying.
 Theo, on the other hand, was looking at the game-board with a heavy frown,
 too absorbed in planning his strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They have to be fun, so people will want to play them.
 Do keep in mind, people's idea of fun differs greatly.
 For instance, Mr.

 to throw away all the navigating equipment.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with a frown, while the captain let the barbed comment sink
 in.
 After seemingly observing a moment of silence, the captain spoke again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're not having that discussion, again, Mr.
 Gunderson,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said flatly and drew on the pipe.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see, Ms.
 Testarossa, fun and games can be quite productive past-times.
 The risk-taking, the strategy involved, the planning, the logistics of
 the thing, your opponent and his idea of you, your idea of him..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and straightened the dead parrot on his shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that's detailed enough, it's like war and all that fighting that goes
 on and on everywhere.
 But if you play it out first, in something as innocuous looking as this
 little board of Po, it might show you an advantageous situation, a way
 out of trouble or a way in.
 A winning strategy, or the cost of defeat.
 It's more of a tool, Po.
 It has the added benefit it's pretty hard to injure yourself.
 Unlike sword-fighting.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So in essence, it's like Zatrik,

 Lernea said nodding.
 Both the captain and Theo were instantly adamant in their rebuttal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 they said in one voice and glowered at her for a moment.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

No need to get excited.
 I'll take your word for it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was nowhere to be seen.
 Which was quite unsettling knowing she could flame her eyes up in a split
 second and start fire-balling everything for no apparent reason.
 Adding her latest streak of paranoia did not help either.

 Perhaps she just wanted to converse with Lernea in a slightly more secluded
 spot - the ship offered plenty of those.

\begin_layout Standard

I'm not doing that; I'm playing Po,

 Stringing words together rather than someone talking, his eyebrows raised

 Theo said and looked around him, the tiny umbrella still stuck in his dreadlock
s.
 The fog was clearing up; the first purely golden rays of sun shafted through
 from above.
 It was as if someone had delineated an invisible line on some grandiose
 map, where one side was all grey and bland and the other side was shiny,
 green and sported cute depictions of butterflies and cupids.
 It looked like the ship had just passed it and emerged on the fancy, nice
 side of the map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So, it worked,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo sent to Lernea mind happily.
 She was standing precariously on the ship's prow, like a living figurehead,
 eyes slightly glowing orange, not unlike tiny beacons.

Not much, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo sent to Lernea's mind with a sigh.
 It seemed like the perfect answer to Lernea for a moment; her mind was
 indeed elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her gaze wandered up and down the coastline that unfurled itself graciously.
 The sun was almost noon-high, shining with all its might.
 Its warmth was a pleasant contrast to the icy fresh breeze; they were still
 somewhere cold but at least there was warmth to be found in the daylight.
 At the farthest reaches, Lernea could still make out large rocky cliffs
 and islets.
 A spatter of snow and ice hugged their tops.
 But the way the ship was pointed, they were sailing straight for a small
 bay, surround by golden and brown thickets.
 In the distance beyond, a hilly terrain formed, slightly sloping into the
 grey phantom vision of a mountain ridge.
 What was more telling, she could see thin columns of smoke rising up from
 the bay.

 Bo sent and Lernea put the bunny down on the deck again.
 She put a finger to her lips and raised an eyebrow.
 It was a deeply concerned expression, the one usually associated with decisions

The walls of the Marvelously Rotund and Equivocally Reassuring Grandiose
 Officious Hall of Endearment were basically rotund and ostensible too large
 for the common eye to perceive.
 Yet it was simply one of many similar halls \SpecialChar \-
 if not in name certainly in
 capacity \SpecialChar \-
 dotted around the Naval Intelligence Bureau building in Rampatur
 City, itself one of many government buildings of varied shape and uniformly
 huge size to be found in the very center of the city.
 From the outside, the Naval Intelligence building looked like an even,
 totally opaque block from which a huge flag of the Human League was unfurled,
 drooping over the north face, above the diminutive revolving door entrance.
 It was identical to any other government building and no-one in Rampatur
 seemed to pay it the least amount of notice, even if everything it shadowed
 was made cooler.
 As in, the temperature dropped because of the huge shadow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hall boasted some soft lighting in the form of a couple of unseen spotlights
; Ned, Tark, Judith and Parcifal were standing under guard.
 Four men in full body armor, boasting elaborately ornate halberds that
 sported some sort of exotic machinery on them were keeping an eye on all
 of them.
 The ridiculously colored suit came with a number of silly-looking hats
 being worn one on top of another, as well as any number of a variety of
 feathers adorning them.
 There were also a number of medals and bones hanging from the guards' breastpla
te armor.
 If anything at all, they looked like some sort of very state-of-the-art
 laughable jokers armed with nonetheless sharp instruments of bleeding death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood emotionless, with a cold, calculating gaze.
 Ned was wary; he felt the whole situation was akin to a very tight balancing
 rope act, without a safety net, and razor sharp spikes on either side of
 the terminal drop.
 Tark was looking smug and confident in a very stylish, simple yet exotic
 suit of black cloth with matching smart pants and soft, spongy shoulder
 pads that made him look pretty suave.
 Judith was weary, fidgeting in her tight leather suit.

\begin_layout Standard
In front of them, at what was probably judged to be a safe but not too impractic
al distance sat the Impromptu Intelligent Committee on Matters of Intelligence
 Missions Gathering Intelligence and Whatnot.
 There was even a wooden sign carved with those exact words sitting on a
 bleak, wooden desk where the members of the Committee rested their crossed
 hands.
 They were all dressed in nondescript white robes.
 Only the older man among them wore a fine-wrought silver chain around his
 neck from where a small curio hang.
 Their desk was filled with all manner of scrolls, maps, and papers which
 were being scrutinized.
 The sound of shuffling papers reverberated across the gigantic empty space
 of the hall which appeared to have, oddly enough, excellent acoustics.

Well it was huge, and made mostly of crystal.

 Tark replied.
 Ned commented with evident sarcasm,

Calm down now, Lady Teletha.
 You're not mistaken; in the morning, we'll have to secure the funding and

 Lady Govida said flatly, before adding with a weighty measure of confidence,

They left the ghost ship with its skeleton crew in a nearby alcove, protected
 from view by the steep, sharp mossy cliffs.
 From then on the walk to the village was an easy, refreshing trip which
 they began as soon as they set foot on land.
 Lernea offered thanks and praise to Svarna for guiding her home, and kissed
 the ground, quickly realizing the picture in her mind did not match the
 taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The salty breeze mingled with the smells of green grass and mush, wet ground.
 It brought a heartfelt smile to Lernea to be back home, even under the
 very unusual circumstances.
 And it was a true wonder in itself that her mentor, friend and caretaker,
 the man who had been to her more than the grandfather she had never met,
 was alive and well, despite what she had seen with her eyes.

Theo felt the cold climate bite at his linen robes.
 The southern seas were warm, and space had been generously temperate and
 comfortable.
 But the northern reaches of Nomos offered a cold, harsh climate, suitable
 for the hardy locals, but not so friendly to anyone else.
 Except Bo who was covered in fur and was quite excited at the prospect
 of munching on northern, exotic grass; brushes were rare and flowers even
 rarer, but they provided a challenge with interesting, mouth-filling rewards.
 She delightfully hopped along, sampling what freshness the outdoors of
 Nomos had to offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was decidedly not asking Sisyphus a lot of questions; she was content
 knowing that there was time enough to get up to date on matters of importance.
 And there were quite a lot of those, Master Sisyphus had told her, but
 his philosophy was that the slow, careful approach, always offered more
 time to think and analyze.
 Those in turn, offered more choices of action, and considerably more ways
 of egress out of nasty situations.
 Which was, how he had by a combination of good fortune and clever planning,
 avoided turning into a crisp.

Winceham? That's an interesting name.

 Lernea added with a soft voice:

Parcifal is with them.
 Only Svarna knows where they are now.
 At least, I think they're safe.
 Last I saw them, they were flying away in a ship, trying to flee a scene

I was referring to the Teletha sisters,

 Master Sisyphus whispered to Lernea then:

As it is the norm these days, secrecy, deceit and counterfeit is essential

The moment she stepped into the house, the smell of roast fish assaulted
 her nostrils, and she felt a pinching on her neck.
 Then another one, and another one in quick succession.
 Her head started spinning and she became oddly aware that the house was

Sisyphus calmly appeared through the door, stepping over Lernea casually.

 he inquired, and a double-shot of tiny globes of fire flew right past his
 hair, singing it slightly, to strike at patches of darkness at the roof.
 Cries of agony were heard before the reassuring thudding of bodies hitting
 the floor.
 Bo appeared through the door, eyes flaring, ears pointing straight up,

 Sisyphus made a hand gesture to the bunny.
 Bo raised her head and looked at him in an uncannily human fashion.

As the sizzling crowd hummed a collective tune of uneasy expectancy in the
 air, the same raw feeling of being slightly nervous had Ned almost sweating.
 Winceham was sitting to his left; his jump from the Mary Righteous had
 been a resounding success.
 After they'd met for dinner, he was loathe to disclose details of his exact
 whereabouts, but he very eagerly went on to consume copious amounts of
 everything consumable, including beer, alcohol and spirits.
 As such, it was no wonder he was grumpy, feeling sick with a splitting
 headache and itching for a smoke, a small luxury that was denied to him
 while the vote was cast.

Winceham toyed with his empty pipe wearing a sour expression on his face.
 Next to him sat Parcifal; her silent manner and grim face afforded her
 an awesome, deadly-looking gaze.
 Her eyes scanned the auditorium piecemeal, looking for danger without success.
 Her gaze though did lock on to the form of the Council members, once they
 entered the auditorium's stage, dressed in elaborate, ornate, red and black
 robes, wearing plush velvet hats that looked like furry bloated versions
 of dead skunk-like creatures, strangely colored but thankfully odorless.
 They looked rather silly to everyone except for the crowd in the auditorium;
 the noise died down to the a few careless whispers too suddenly.
 Ned turned his head and asked Judith in a whisper:

 Parcifal hissed suddenly and her eyes met with Ned's in a strange, awkwardly
 cold fashion.
 She was evidently upset; she hadn't been herself ever since Lernea was
 drawn in that cataclysmic hole, possibly lost forever.
 They knew Lernea, Theo and Bo were alive, but where they had ended up was
 beyond them.
 There was little they could do, and there were more pressing issues at
 hand; their home planet was in danger and this was their chance to make
 a whole lot of difference.
 It was disconcerting for Ned though not to be able to read through Parcifal's
 opaqueness; he didn't know whether she was so tightened up because she
 might never see her sister again or because of a whole world being at stake.
 Still, he was worried about her, and especially that temper of hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned felt surprisingly calm and reassured.
 It was as if he knew that everything was somehow going to work out itself.
 He felt that his new friends were able to hold on their own.
 And even if they never met again, just knowing they were alive somewhere
 made him breath more easily.
 His mind went to Judith suddenly; there too, was a newly found friend.
 He smiled thinly as he ventured a sideways look to the young woman who
 had saved his life back on Tallyflop; he was about to say something to
 her when he felt Winceham's elbow poking him through his ribs:

 the announcer's voice rumbled throughout the hall and there was a slight

 Before Ned had time to do anything about it, Parcifal picked him up from

 His only mark of office was a silver pin against his chest; it was the

Lord Privy, we are tarrying here ineffectually.
 We haven't even qualified these people as human and here they are, parading
 across the city, feasting and gallivanting like honored guests at the expenses

 These people,

 And it is all at the behest of Lady Govida who has time and again proved

 Not to mention her blatant disregard for mere appearance's sake.

 Lady Godiva cannot be entrusted with those responsibilities she so vividly

The good Lord Kennelsey obviously has no real facts to present to this assembly,

 invaluable insight into this new-fangled threat.
 I will not go into the depth and breadth of the threat that Lord Kennelsey's
 fixation with what happens in people's bedrooms might entail for the safety
 of the Human League at large.
 It is perhaps of paramount importance in his own mind, but I have yet to
 see an army of lovers amassing their forces against us.

It is no wonder Lady Govida so shamelessly admits her malfeasance to appear

 It is of course a sure sign of growing increasingly power-hungry and arrogant,
 which are indeed dangerous traits for a person entailed with such sensitive
 responsibilities.
 She keeps on purveying all about this Ygg threat without one solid piece
 of evidence.
 What we do have to go on is hearsay and imaginary reports from the man
 who is shamefully intimate with the Head of the Bureau.

Seriously, this attack on my credibility is Lord Kennelsey's futile and
 desperately embarrassing effort to sway this council and the public towards

 If there is one thing Lord Kennelsey is known for, is his long-standing
 service to the Human League as chancellor and treasurer, secretary to various
 bureaucratic offices and highly profitable positions which have time and

 to shuffle cartloads of paper off-world,

Isn't it satisfying to hear Lady Govida use the same line of reasoning against

 thank her for that.
 But it is not I who seeks to spread lies and disinformation to befuddle
 and daze the public, wary of my pompous ways.
 My service to the Human League is a matter of public record; and if I were
 as arrogant and self-aggrandizing as Lady Govida, I would consider myself
 proud to have served fully and to the best of my ability the Human League
 through means rather less glittery and awe-inspiring than Naval Intelligence

 Several scout vessels would be needed to collect information on this imaginary

Master Sisyphus and Lernea were sharing some mead together with some cuts
 of smoked fish.
 The smell was overpoweringly homely to Lernea, the rough wooden table felt
 almost alive to her touch.
 A few negligent rays of sun shafted down from what little cracks and holes
 lay in the roof, warming up the make-shift laboratory just the right amount
 to make it feel welcoming despite all the strange apparatus lying about,
 looking menacingly unfathomable and uncomfortably pointy.

 she replied with half a smile.

At first it felt exciting, but then it felt rather dull.

 Lernea replied in earnest and drank from her cup; the strong mead made
 her body shiver and her face twitch.
 Sisyphus swallowed his bite and offered Lernea an explanation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Such is the way of riding the waves of life, Lernea.
 You've just embarked on the Dromos, life's great boat, that's why it can

Life is short, considering what we mortals wish to leave behind.

 Sisyphus said with mirth.
 His words made Lernea genuinely smile; she almost felt like a child once
 more.

 Sisyphus said and produced Theo's crystal from a pocket in his robes.
 It looked every bit as perfect as the last time Lernea had laid eyes upon
 it; there was a faint cloud of lights dancing in its very heart, casting
 rays filled with an arcane glow, forming intricate geometrical patterns.
 Lernea was instantly awestruck and nearly drowned as her mouthful of mead
 had suddenly found a route through her nose.

 Sisyphus said shaking his head slightly, a meditating look on his age-worn

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I know you have bonded with them in the fires of battle, but they seem..

I know the feeling, master, and it's entirely understandable.
 In fact, strange doesn't even begin to describe those two,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said with an involuntary smirk.
 Sisyphus put the crystal on the table and laid his hands on his knees,
 his gaze wandering at the door of his study, as if peering through it.

I'm afraid I have become perhaps jaded when it comes to people now-days;

 Sisyphus suggested and Lernea countered,

 Lernea said shyly, her face grim and demanding.
\end_layout

Then we need to know what this crystal is exactly.

The thaumaturgic attunement and radiance device.

Damon! Fidias!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments of silence ensued; nothing but the sounds of birds chirping
 outside was heard.
 Then the door to Sisyphus study swung open wildly, the two boys breaking
 a sweat and panting, very nearly standing on top of one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Damon said, wearing a worried frown that looked like it was worn most of

One stupid question, then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fidias said as if to correct his master, his eyes searching for a place
 to hide, awaiting the impending scolding.
 Sisyphus said nothing for an awkward moment and then flung his cup against
 Fidias with a flick of his wrist.
 Fidias dodged the cup expertly and remarked in quizzical, rather than impertine

What was that for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

That was for testing your reflexes, as well as creating another stupid question,

 You have to think smart, not just sound like it.

 Sisyphus said with a sigh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Tellerator?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon asked hesitantly, looking exactly like someone who wished he had

 Much to the boys disappointment, evident in their miserable faces, Sisyphus
 remained adamant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Tellerator machine.
 And hop to it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he insisted while the boys sprang into action, raising the lid of a hatch
 on the wooden floor and lowering a small ladder.
 Soon, they disappeared in the basement busily.
 Lernea offered quietly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't you think you're running the boys a bit too harshly, master? They're

 Young,

 she said finally after searching for the word and it sounded a bit peculiar

 It felt so long ago that she and Parcifal were in their place, yet it now
 seemed like another life entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They're brimming with life and energy, their minds are like a sponge - somewhat

 Hasn't it been that way with you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea considered that for a bit.
 She raised a brow and replied earnestly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can't really tell.
 I mean, I'm still learning and I've seen thing I can't even recall I had

 I sometimes shudder to think that I was the Queen of Nomos, even for just

 It makes me doubtful, uneasy,

 she said looking troubled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But I plow on, nonetheless.
 With a little help from Parcifal, and my friends,

 The disgruntled voice of Fidias was heard as well, muffled as it came from
 further inside the basement:

Oh, you'll wish you hadn't.

Winceham was craning his neck upwards, trying to fit the whole length of
 the ship in his field of vision, but that wasn't possible.
 It wasn't possible for any of them from that up close to see the HLS Magnometri
ton in its full glory.
 Judith had been assigned to be their liaison with the ship's commander
 but so far, they'd seen no-one to liaise with and they were simply waiting,
 sitting down at the docks of Navy Spire Thirty-Seven where the fleet had
 mostly assembled.
\end_layout

Ned seemed to be in high spirits, and Parcifal was absorbed in watching

 Winceham was idly getting ready for a smoke, and Judith looked weary, even
 glum.

Below them lay more than a thousand feet of drop to the streets and shops

 so unbearably in stark contrast to all the activity around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were hundreds of men and women loading up the ships with provisions
 of many kinds, some of which were fairly basic like dried food; for the
 larger part though, it was the cannon-shot and all sorts of strange colourful
 pellets of some sort that seemed to demand the utmost care.
 There was quite quite some noise from all the activity, but not it wasn't

 The sound of buffeting winds rushed by them from time to time.

 Winceham said in an off-beat way, getting ready to light up his pipe with
 a local variety he was eager to taste, more doubly so since he had acquired
 the particular pouch of tobacco by virtue of his trade skills, namely,
 he'd stolen it from an unsuspecting, though evidently quite well-off man
 in the streets of Rampatur City.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judith turned her head and looked at the halfuin with a seriously bland
 expression; a slight shake of her head and a minuscule shrug of her shoulders
 only meant that she had no comment on that; which only meant it was true

 Ned appeared rather hurt than shocked.

 Parcifal told Judith, in an almost scolding tone.
 Judith's eyes flashed not with anger, but with the glimmer of an innocent,
 hurt pride.

I realise much more than you think you do, lady Teletha.

Or any of you.
 My loyalty defines me, it's what makes me useful.

 It was Parcifal who stood before Judith, the wind ruffling her short hair,
 her face unperturbed in any way, and told her:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can't speak for the others, but I understand a soldier's loyalties cannot

 It would mean her ruin one way or the other.

 Be it so, I shall stand my ground next to you, sword in hand, to face the

\begin_layout Standard
Judith nodded solemnly to Parcifal, while Ned shook his head slightly.
 Winceham shrugged before coughing wildly, his body shaking; he roared and
 grumbled for a few moments, before clearing up his lungs and throat.
 A hearty glob of mucus and spit left his lips and landed a couple of feet
 away, and onto a pair of nice, shiny boots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boots belonged to a tall, almost gaunt man with a smart beard and mustache,
 who looked rather prim and elegant in his suit, full of decorations and
 shiny bars and medals, without being chest-heavy because of them.
 He was wearing a captain's cap and owned a set of piercing black eyes;
 by his side stood an attache, a rather short fellow with a face seemingly
 built for smiling, which was what he was doing even as he reached for the
 captain's boots with a piece of cloth.

Why, yes.

 Ned said out of turn, looking stern but not angry.
 The captain replied in kind, even as his attache had cleaned up the glob
 of spit; realizing the piece of cloth had been rendered useless, he tossed
 it expertly without the captain noticing.
 Winceham offered a slight bow of apology and the attache just shrugged
 it off with a grin and a thumbs-up, which only served to confuse the halfuin.
\end_layout

I wouldn't know, sir; it's in the Navy's line of business to insult each

 Ned said and Judith simply shot him a wild-eyed look and went up the stairs

\begin_layout Standard
Master Sisyphus was juggling a number of dials and levers of an arcane design
 in an expert, controlled fashion.
 Whirring sounds and the occasional clanging noise reverberated throughout
 the intricate machine as he handled it with attention to every detail,
 feeling his way to the mysteries of the crystal under scrutiny as it revolved
 slowly in a receptacle which glowed with a multitude of lights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two boys, Damon and Fidias were both pedaling hard on a doohickey made
 of leather belts and iron cast wheels connected in a complex way to the
 tatar device.
 Sweat ran down their foreheads freely, their faces flush red.

 Damon ventured, panting.

Be silent.
 This is delicate work! Keep pedaling!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus replied hastily without turning his focus away from the machine.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This is fantastic.

So much for being an expert,

 Fidias said under his breath.
 To his dismay, Sisyphus overheard the comment, even though he was evidently
 enthralled by the study of the crystal.

 the boy complained painfully and slowed down the pedaling.
 The tatar device began flickering, becoming unstable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

More pedal! Don't slow down, not now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus urged the two boys and Fidias groaned, pedaling back up to speed.
 The flickering stopped and the machine resumed its normal, still unsettling
 noises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

If that seems to be the case, then...
 By the Gods, I need to write this down.

We know!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fidias groaned again, his voice brooding from the physical effort, only
 to elicit Damon's weary eye and a thorough, disapproving shake of the other
 boy's head.
 Master Sisyphus was engrossed in finding a clean piece of scroll and a
 pen in what undoubtedly was a mess of a laboratory, pieces of equipment
 lying about in various states of working order, ranging from nuts and bolts
 to full-blown monstrosities ready to go if one dared to use them.
 Still though, a simple writing apparatus complete with paper and ink wasn't
 easy to find under a heap of books, plans, designs and thingamajigs.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bah! What good are you two when you're most needed?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus wondered and shuffled at various desks and shelves at random.
 Before long, he found a suitable piece of scroll, that had only been used
 in the most rudimentary way; an old shopping list with enough room in the
 back.
 He picked up a jarred piece of a broken glass tube, very much like a sharp-tipp
ed pen and dipped it in a nearby pool of dropped, always-wet ink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Could you hurry up, master? I can't feel my legs anymore,

 Damon asked petulantly.

 Fidias added morosely.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would you have it on your heads if the world crumbles away and the universe
 is engulfed in the eternal flames of destruction?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus asked the boys in all seriousness even as his hand scribbled down
 in a muddied, dense script, notes, numbers and designs that seemed to make
 no sense.
 The two boys barely had the energy to venture a miserable look at each
 other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This will change everything.
 At least, everything that matters,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus said staring at the piece of scroll he had just finished writing
 down.
 He put the piece of glass dripping with ink down on the machine, and simply
 stared at the crystal in awe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Can we stop now? Please, master,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon said even as the lights on the machine began flickering on and off
 alarmingly once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Haven't we discussed the merits of perseverance, Damon?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Master Sisyphus said even as a terrible cracking noise thundered above
 them, followed by a series of thuds and howls.
 It sounded like a whirlwind had ripped the roof of the house.
 Sisyphus looked up, as if the noise was unsettling only in the way a pesky
 rat might be.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon said as his pedaling slowed to less than a walking pace, while Fidias
 had given up entirely and was resting his chin on a handle of the pedaling
 apparatus.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I want to go to sleep,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fidias murmured drowsily, right before the wooden planks above their heads
 was ripped apart by half a dozen blue and black claws.
 Through the gaping chasm, tendrils writhed and squirmed like living things
 with a mind of their own, reaching for the two boys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm afraid that'll have to wait.
 Pole-arms! On the double, boys! Cover!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said and reached under his robes, uncovering a minuscule repeating
 crossbow with unusually sharp cone-shaped bolts.
 The boys fell on the ground instinctively, the clawed hands and tendrils
 hitting nothing but air.
 Sisyphus had an easy enough target, a blue-black mass of flesh that was
 stuck half-way into the basement.
 He let fly his shots wildly, turning a crank that reloaded the crossbow
 in less than a second.
 All the bolts found their target; the monsters seemed to feel and acknowledge
 that they'd been hit, but it didn't seem to slow them down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They ripped another whole section of flooring and just when they were about
 to jump down, they began trembling uncontrollably, faint rivulets of milky
 fluid oozing from where they'd been stung.
 The next moment, they exploded like a toad on a hot summer's day, without
 warning, in a messy, gory fashion, milky blood and pieces of tendrils and
 arms flying in all directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That wasn't supposed to happen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus said puzzled, while the boys reappeared, each armed with a wooden
 training pole-arm easily three times as tall as them.
 Lernea popped her head through the flooring, milky stuff dripping from
 her dangling hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Master, we need to move.
 Right now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said urgently while behind her Bo shot past in an amazing flying leap,
 shooting fireballs that left a sizzling sound long after they'd flown into
 a couple of directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Not the training pole-arms! The real ones!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus exploded in anger, while tucking the crystal and the piece of
 scroll safely under his robes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Ready or not, you'll have to do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and reached for an arrow in her quiver before standing up and
 away from the hole in the floor.
 The sounds of battle echoed down below, as otherworldly cries rose up from
 numerous directions.

You heard the queen, boys.
 Consider this a pass if you live,

 Fidias wondered and Damon shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You don't suppose this is just another elaborate test?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fidias said, as they too climbed the creaky staircase, wielding the pole-arms
 in a cumbersome manner, very much like fishing poles.
 What they saw at ground floor, left them speechless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The roof of the house had been ripped apart, as if shaved off.
 The walls had mostly turned into rough patches of still standing wood and
 bodies of the same hideous black-and-blue monsters that had attacked them
 lay everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny that had only barely singed a couple of locks off their hair,
 was hopping about, letting go fire-bolts with dead-eye accuracy at the
 ranks of the approaching, abyssal foe that the boys had only believed existed
 in nightmares, of the worst sort.
 Lernea was picking her targets wisely, covering for Bo, and Theo was levitating
 a foot or so above ground, holding his hands against his ears, as if trying
 to block out everything from his mind.

 head of a flying Ygg who had bad ideas about her welfare.

Excellent tactical analysis, my queen.
 But on the strategic side, if those Ygg were already here, lying in wait...
 That only meant they were waiting for you, and that crystal,

 Sisyphus told her as he stood by her side, reloading his crossbow with
 spare bolts from a cupboard-turned-armory.

What did you find out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied as she nocked another arrow in her bow, waiting for a good

 Bo was having a blast, literally but was too busy turning Ygg into crispy

 Master Sisyphus said and Lernea replied with a shake of her head and said

 close, in a slow, languid fashion, the sound of the compression shock that
 expanded from Theo visible in the air, blanketing everything in all directions.

And indeed, just like a stone makes waves when it lands on water, so did
 the power of Rho reverberate in a radius all around them, the Ygg writhing

 their bodies to slump hard against the ground, exactly like a puppet whose

 the short, thick-set captain of the HLS Maryland asked Ned, eagerly waiting
 for a reply.
 Ned was surveying the starry landscape with an intricate eye-piece that
 only served to make the distant stars a tad less brighter.
 Nothing remotely strange registered; instead, the world of Laertia rotated
 slowly, filling most of the star-scape with its blue, white and green hues.

Not yet, captain.
 I don't see anything strange.

 Ned said thoughtfully and turned to look at the captain with a furrowed
 brow.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have you noticed anything strange, Mr.
 Peelpot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he then asked the plump little man whose uniform looked about ready to
 burst.
 The captain of the HLS Maryland gave the matter the short time of attention
 it required and formulated an easy enough answer: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're running low on beer, sir, and as any half-competent sailor will tell
 you, that could prove to be troublesome.
 A beer-disgruntled crew is no laughing matter; I'll check the stores personally.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I was under the impression that, with the ship being so small and all, there's
 very little crew involved.
 In fact,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned nodded at Winceham who was shooting craps with a small gang of sailors
 under the main mast of the Maryland, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there's the whole lot of the crew right there.
 They look disgruntled all right, but I wouldn't suppose it's because of
 the beer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he pointed out as another wave of boos and awfully uncharming swearing
 rose out from a half-dozen men who seemed to be having a suspiciously long-wind
ed streak of bad luck, while the captain disappeared below deck in a show
 of swiftness that his plump body belied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Seven times in a row? Again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried one of the crew.
 Judging from the look on his face, even if he was probably not very well
 versed in statistics, he knew there was something terribly lucky about
 winning seven times in a row, again.
 And everyone knew, luck always runs out in the end, not the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is seven a bad number for you? How about eight?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said with a provocatively smug grin, just about ready to throw
 another round of the dice.
 Another one of the crew rose up to his full height, which was a little
 more than twice Winceham's diminutive, halfuin-standard size.
 He placed a very haunting look of bad things waiting to happen on him,
 but Winceham continued unfazed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bets? Anyone? No?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked around, more comfortable-looking than a pig rolling in mud.
 He received no reply and just as he was ready to pick up the small pile
 of coins resting on the ship's floor, the tall, heavy-set sailor who otherwise
 looked like a nice fellow, withholding the fact he could crush a man larynx
 single-handedly, told him in a rather calm yet threatening way.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

These are my winnings.

 Winceham said as he made to gather the small shiny golden pile in his cupped
 hands.

 hand, implying that was no secret to anyone.

Now I won't have any of that name-calling.
 First and foremost, I'm a gentleman and I demand some satisfaction to my

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said in a passionate voice even as he began sweeping the coins
 with the cup of his hand off the ship's deck and into his money pouch.
 Everyone of the sailors had lost money.
 A lot of money that perhaps equaled half of a month's pay.
 Which was a quarter of their drinking money.
 Which was a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them took the dice into his hand for the first time since Winceham
 started shooting, and felt them in his hands.
 Then he held one up and turned it round and round; they looked like perfectly
 ordinary dice.
 He shot one down on the deck; the dice hopped and spun, and fumbled and
 sat in one of its faces with a seriously ponderous wobble.
 The face had the crude drawing of an anchor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The group got up on their feet and huddled around Winceham, just about ready
 to unanimously vote on giving him a silent treatment of the old soap in
 a sock.
 Ned demanded their attention, in his most conversational tone of voice:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The men slowly looked at Ned with a curious kind of gaze, the kind people
 might think lizards look like when copulating.
 It was eerie and uncomfortable, but it somehow got their attention for
 a moment, only to have Winceham pull them back in:

 Ned said to himself mostly and another sailor, the eldest of the crew,
 the one who had misheard earlier, did so again.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the tall sailor said grinning.
 Winceham replied after weighing in his options for a moment.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That'll have to do then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the halfuin said and kicked hard and high, aiming for the sailor's jaw.
 Instead, he missed and his boot connected with the sailor's nose; a crunching
 sound was heard and blood spurted, some of it spilling on his boot.
 The sailor growled with pain and the next instant, a shout was heard from
 someone in the crew:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fists began flying and various instruments of seamanship found new use as
 bruising, head-crushing implements.
 Stools and pegs were in good supply and eagerly used as well.
 Ned hadn't realised how easy it was for a gambling issue to escalate into
 a full-fledged fist-fight.
 They had only been out to space for a day, and yet the beer had run dry,
 and the crew was already fighting amongst themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of Winceham's voice trailed off into a dusty cloud of fists and
 brawler's growls.
 He was well into the fight, and Ned knew that the captain of the HLS Maryland
 should be taking things into his hands sooner rather than later; unfortunately
 he discovered the captain was ostentatiously drunk, trying to steer the
 ship by using a strange mechanism that included a dead fish and one of
 those dangerous-looking, multicolored cannonballs.
 He was having difficulty keeping the dead fish level on the rolling cannonball.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What the hell happened to rigor mortis, eh? Bloody useless fish.
 Throw'em out to dead space, I say!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Captain Peelpot urged no-one in particular, and Ned sadly realised he was
 all alone, at least until the rest of the fleet arrived.
 Ned took the helm into his hands, smiling all the time at the captain who
 was looked at him with a wild-eyed look of confoundment and asked him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come to me, my bristling sea-wench, smelling of salty toffee, wet like the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Captain Peelpot cried and throwing the dead fish aside, tried to grab Ned
 with arms open-wide and kiss him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was very nearly taken off-guard and side-stepped the drunk-like-a-bat
 captain at the last moment; he put out his foot and tripped him, but as
 Captain Peelpot was going down, he reached out a hand and grabbed Ned down
 with him.
 The prospect of being fondled on the deck of a very fast picket by a drunken
 captain of the Human League did not appeal to Ned who held on to the helm,
 making the ship roll with him abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship swerved violently and changed attitude and course as if some gigantic
 hand slapped its sides; and it was at that exact moment that Ned saw a
 blinding flash of purplish light fill the void of space above them, casting
 pinkish shades all over the ship.
 A great swath of light, like a flaming torrent of pure energy had missed
 them by a couple of seconds, Ned realised, and just a look made everything
 so much clearer and darker at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A huge oblong shadowy shape, stony black and flashing blue at times, was
 looming at an ever-decreasing distance, struts of jutting rock laden with
 bizarre crystal constructs.
 It was sort of terrible ship, shaped like a malevolent arrowhead of grim,
 dark stone and it was clearly on a collision course.

 situation.

 Captain Peelpot yelled as if waking up from a terrible nightmare, demonstrating
 surprising clarity and brio.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Captain Peelpot said in an orderly, commanding fashion, though still somewhat
 slurring his words.
 Ned was pleasantly surprised because they were still uncharred and alive,
 and the Captain seemed to know his stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were dead drunk,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned told the Captain with an approving smile, even as he gave the helm
 another random swing and push and the ship dived and swerved erratically,
 avoiding another swath of purple light, bright as the sun and wider than
 the main mast of the Maryland.

 The Captain swerved the ship around and with the crew finally taking their
 places and Winceham panting on the deck, searching for his pipe, the Captain
 screamed in a maddening show of the power of intoxication:
\end_layout

Of course not! If we we were sure, we wouldn't be out there, caught in that

 the Captain said almost crying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, I thought so as much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and punched Captain Peelpot in the face, bringing him down on
 the deck, harmlessly but certainly painfully unconscious.
 Another great column of purple light missed the ship proper by a few feet,
 evaporating the top of the mast without so much as a sizzle.

 He gave simple, short directions at every junction, and Bo hopped along

Bo, lights,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and the next instant the cave filled with light.
 The vision that filled everyone's eyes made them freeze in place, holding
 their breaths.
 Everywhere around the cave walls, there were strange, egg-like things clinging
 on to the rock and dirt like clams.
 Even in the stony pillars that held the ceiling, interspersed around the
 cave, these odd eggs lay, scaly and fish-like in appearance, yet trembling
 and pulsating like living things.

 Theo noted and nodded enthusiastically to himself.

An infestation.
 A hatchery of some sort.
 By the Gods, these Ygg are a devilish plague.

 Sisyphus replied and cautiously moved forward.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's the plug, that circular plate of metal over there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and pointed with his staff to a manhole in, jutting out of the
 ceiling at the end of a metal pipe a few yards away.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We need to get to the Walled Garden.
 It is where the so-called monument is being constructed.
 Does everyone remember the layout? We need to move like shadows.
 If things get out of hand and we're forced to fight, make it quick.
 Whatever lays in the Garden, must be destroyed.
 Speed is of the essence.

 he asked once more and looked behind him only to discover they weren't

 A quick look around the cave unveiled their presence; they were poking
 a couple of the eggs with their daggers, giggling and toying with each
 other, as if the eggs were just one of many curious toys.

 Sisyphus shouted, his voiced raised to an echoing din.

 Sisyphus said and the boys sprung into a running spree, like a pile of
 hot coals was shoved down their backsides.
 At the same moment, the eggs opened up fully, each one revealing a tentacled
 larva the size of a large rat, arrayed in dark, glistening scaled, hundreds
 of pseudo-pods writhing as they emerged and began crawling around the floor

 The next instant, he disappeared inside it fully.

What if they're friendly? Maybe they just want to be pet.

 Lernea shouted as she reached for the boys' hands, hanging upside down,
 Master Sisyphus holding on to her legs, using his body as a counterweight,

 he said enthusiastically and did so, his hands latching on to Lernea's.
 With a straining effort she pulled him slightly upwards, before he could
 put one hand on a handle and feel his way up.
 Bo took care of the hatchlings with small pulses of fire shooting forth
 from her eyes, burning them to a crisp one by one without even singing
 Theo's hair.
 The next moment, Theo was lying down on the cistern's bed, hatchling-free.
 Right behind him, a couple or so hatchlings crawled their way up, hundreds

 a number of hatchling as it firmly closed the manhole and screwed itself

A sleek, fiery streak of light, metal and wood hurled itself across the

 Close behind it like an incessant hound on its mark, was the jagged hulk

 fire that threatened to burn down the main mast.
 The ship's hull glowed with a warm, at times fierce orange and silvery
 light as they entered the planet with a speed far superior to the one the
 ship had been designed for.
 Unfortunately for them, the Ygg behemoth which closely resembled a sharp

 Ned added from a prone position on the deck, after a sudden violent lurch

 he shouted out, his eyes searching for Parcifal frantically.
 He saw her then, at the stern of the ship, perched inside a huge throne-like
 enclosure, like a bird in a cage with a pretty hefty-looking cannon attached
 to the cage.
 Then the whole assembly she was using through all sorts of levers intricately
 connected to a whirring, rotating mass of cogs and rods, shook in its entirety
 as a violent, blinding, multi-hued colored fireball shot forth from the
 cannon's muzzle in a show of sputtering fireworks.
 A moment or so later the shot landed at the Ygg ship, tearing down a jutting
 rock spire and stripping it away from the main ship, crumbling in the air
 as the turbulent air wrecked it to pieces.
 The Ygg ship seemed to have noticed, trying to swerve a moment too late,
 but only barely; it answered with a massive volley of violet bursts of
 raw energy in a square-grid pattern, its source a neatly packed, shiny
 mass of rough-hewn crystals.

 Ned yelled, running towards her, the mast behind him snapping in two like
 a badly burned fire log, just when Winceham put the Maryland in a violent
 downward spin.
 The sudden lurching motion threw everyone off their feet, except for Parcifal
 who was tied down in her cannon cage and Winceham who held on to the helm
 like the last mug of beer in the universe, his body going flat, in line
 with the deck.
 The rest of the crewmen were very professional about it all and simply

 she said while another tap on her knee made her pull on the firing lever,
 and another fiery ball of light and destruction was hurled against the
 Ygg battleship and missed.
 The Ygg ship was steadily closing in and this time replied with a salvo

 Ned exploded, completely unaware of a deadly mass of iron in the shape

 Parcifal yelled and thrust Encelados blindly towards the crew-master.
 Ned saw a flash of silver then and feared for the worst.
 Before he had time enough to speak a word, the fog lifted as if some giant

\begin_layout Standard
An Ygg was standing between the crew-master and Parcifal, Encelados protruding
 from the monster's belly, its blue-on-blue eyes flickering with their dying

 Winceham screamed and took out his daggers, tumbled swiftly on the deck

 The Ygg turned around and with a throaty yell lunged at Winceham, its tentacles
 writhing morbidly.
 Ned went for his crossbow and loaded a bolt, before realizing the Ygg warship

 a demonic spider's head ready to spout its venom.

 Ned cried in anguish before springing into a sprint for the ship's helm.

He was too late.
 The Ygg warship let a volley of bright crackling energy rays head on in
 the Maryland's bow.
 The arcane crackling energies flashed violet and bored through the HLS
 Maryland easily, ripping holes in its wooden and metal hull, small and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship keeled slightly to its left and began a whimpering free-fall, bereft

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole ship fell finally apart with a loud cracking, whipping noise and
 everyone fell down to meet a certain death a few thousand feet below, the

Parcifal folded her arms and fell downwards like a brick, surpassing everyone
 else who were haplessly tumbling in the air.
 Their eyes were sharp and clean, bereft of fear.
 Ned had closed his eyes, his legs splayed and his arms wide.
 Winceham was trying to steady himself in the air, fumbling for his tobacco
 pouch; remembering his tobacco pouch had been cut in half, he rolled his
 eyes and folded his arms, beginning to tumble fuzzily once more.

Her body began to transform; her skin became taught as her body began to
 swell and grow.
 From her back, a leathery protrusion grew into an ever-expanding tail.
 Her chest became swollen and her sides writhed as if a newborn was about
 to kick and scream its way out.
 Her face was cast in a reverend agony, while her feet and hands began to
 grow talons.
 Her clothes were ripped apart even as her head became elongated, her forehead
 becoming a bony, enlarged plate.
 Her nose turned into a snout and her skin turned into a leathery, deeply-scaled
 hide, red and orange, the colour of fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the span of a few heartbeats, she had turned fully into a dragon, red

 She turned and swept in the air, feeling for the currents, before she began

 her spine.

 Winceham whispered mostly to himself as he twisted his head around to see
 Parcifal, in her dragonform, twist in the air gracefully and clutch Ned
 easily in one of her claws.
 He then saw her coming for him, swooping down like a majestic predator.
 He was confused, feeling unsure whether or not he'd been kind enough to
 Parcifal for her not to rip him apart, possibly claiming it was only a
 mistake afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She caught him expertly in the air and he was swept upwards as she rolled

The bow of the mighty Human League warship appeared out of the clouds forcefully

 Parcifal commented and nodded with her dragon head to a flotilla of several

 At about the same time, the Human League flotilla appeared out of the cloudscap

\begin_layout Standard
Theo was standing in the middle of a rough circle formed by the rest: Lernea
 was down to her last few arrows, and Bo couldn't shoot her fireballs fast
 enough and barely had enough thaumaturgy left in her to hop around.
 Damon and Fidias were using their slings and blowpipes to little effect,
 while Master Sisyphus was quietly contemplating their situation.
 Everyone's feet were wet, except for Theo who was hovering above the waters
 of the shallow lake uncannily, as if praying solemnly.
 Around them, hundreds of Ygg were closing in, marching instead of charging,
 as if they were biding their time, reveling in the promise of the coming
 slaughter.

 Fidias looked at Damon then with a sorrowful grin, his green eyes having

If it comes to that, there couldn't be a better place, friend,

 Fidias said and reloaded his sling with a pebble from the Hallowed Lake,
 letting it fly hard against an Ygg a few yards away.
 The pebble struck the Ygg in his mouth, whereas it begun choking and convulsing
, before crumbling down onto its clawed feet and splashing in the lake.
 Others quickly replaced their fallen kin and followed in its steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Damon first and then Fidias felt a harsh, bony thing hit them hard against
 their cheeks, followed by a slapping sound.
 It was Master Sisyphus, who had shown them once again the back of his hand,
 while the rest of the party kept tightening the circle around Theo as if
 partaking in a silent, slow dance with death itself, every movement sombre
 and unique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Sisyphus exclaimed and his face instantly returned to an unusually calm
 look of deep introspection.
 He then looked at the sky, and noticed that higher up near the clouds,
 a dozen or maybe more dark spots were being brilliantly lit from, flashes
 of light of various colours dousing them in a flame-like appearance.
 Then he noticed the flapping wings of a red dragon, and his thin, craggy
 lips curled into a tight smile.

 Lernea said and looked behind Theo, exchanging a knowing glance with her
 former Master and mentor.
 She knew then he wasn't talking about the Ygg - he looked up and saw the
 large red dragon coming down right on top of them, behind her, higher up
 into the clouds, strange-looking blots that were probably some kind of
 ship, literally having a blast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment she thought when it was the last time she had seen a dragon

 Bo sent, and perched herself on Theo's shoulder, huffing and puffing from

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal spat a gush of fire from her snout, engulfing a row of Ygg in writhing
 flames, their raspy throats letting out otherworldly growls of dying pain.
 Her attack cleared some space in front of Lernea, while she flapped her
 wings quickly, breaking hard and releasing Winceham and Ned from a couple
 of feet into the lake, letting them splash feebly in the water, meeting
 the shallow bottom of the lake with their faces.

 Lernea said sternly, while Parcifal let the surviving crew of the Maryland

 A shot of bright blue light like thunder-flash cut a swath of Ygg down
 like a reaper's giant scythe.
 It was Sisyphus, who was looking at his staff with a sad, pitiful gaze.
 Winceham and Ned got back on their feet, Ned loading his crossbow with

 charged headlong against the oncoming wave of the Ygg, cutting a path through
 them even as the monstrous abominations tried their best to slash and pierce
 them with their claws, their tendrils aiming to grab them in any way possible.
 Lernea hacked, swiveled and pierced the monsters, while Parcifal swiped
 with her claws and breathed fire, cutting down half a dozen Ygg at a time.

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters were a terrible sight to behold, looking invincible, a powerful

 Damon cried in terror, while Fidias popped up from behind him and stuck

 the crewman replied shaking his head and shrugging.
 A moment later the claws of an Ygg were dug deep in his neck, his tentacled
 maw attached to the back of the man's head.
 His eyes twitched and rolled impossibly, his face chock-full of mortal
 horror, even as his eyes were drawn inside from their sockets, the contents
 of his head sucked through the Ygg's maw.
 A heavy cutlass struck clean against the Ygg, its head rolling while still
 alive, its tentacles still writhing with the splendor of a fresh kill.
 The crew-master looked at the Ygg with disgust as its body lay slumped
 against the empty husk of the crewman who had just asked for his due break.

 Winceham suggested as he unstuck his daggers from a dead Ygg, tumbling
 at the last moment to avoid a deadly claw attack from another.
 Ned shot his crossbow at point-blank range, felling two Ygg with one bolt.
 He swerved to the side and dodged a dozen or so tendrils aiming for his
 waist, before kicking the Ygg hard in the face, making it dizzy for just
 enough time to hack at its head with a machete.
 The first hack dug deep; the second and the third made the killing a nasty,
 messy affair.

 Ned wondered and wiped the machete against the Ygg's body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was at that moment that everyone felt a wave of pressure overcoming them,
 feeling it reverberate through their bones.
 They saw the Ygg then tremble, growling in agony for a moment before succumbing
 to Theo's powerful Rho, splashing in the water in an outward pattern, like
 stalks of grass blown against the wind.
 Theo fell down awkwardly with a splash as well, planting his feet in the
 bottom of the lake, gasping for breath, sweating profusely.

 Ned said and nodded to a small host of riders that appeared out of the

Well, I guess you can now have the rest of your break, lads,

 the crew-master said and the crew sat down in the shallow water, the water
 up to their waist as their buttocks touched the pebble-bed floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The small host of riders galloped at an easy pace, the horses' hooves splashing
 in the water in a strange, perfect rhythm.
 A man wearing the Jangdrival's colors over a shiny full-plate armor was
 at the head of the host, all in all no more than a dozen riders.
 Beside him rode a banner-man, flying the colours of the Jangdrivals proudly,
 on top of the Nomos crest, the Holy Mountain, embroidered in gold and silver
 cloth.

 the leader of the host ordered and dismounted, a comfortable few yards

 close behind.
 The rest of them remained mounted.

Stubborn animals, humans,

 the Jangdrival said and in an instant his body warped and twisted itself
 violently, revealing the true form of an Ygg, the men in his company doing
 the same, and the horses transforming into large carapaced abyssal terrors,
 with large bulging eyes and a mass of tendrils with enormous reach.

\begin_layout Standard

 the crew-master intoned, brandishing his cutlass, before the Ygg and their
 mounts charged at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is tactically unsound,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus said grumpily.
 Ned shot a bolt smack against an Ygg's face - but it was silently absorbed,
 like the body of an Ygg was made of some sort of sponge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The crystal!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said as well, as if he had a sudden realization, and he produced
 the crystal from his robes, attaching it deftly to his staff's tip, like
 popping it into a make-shift receptacle.
 Bo saw what Sisyphus was trying to do and skipped and hopped towards him,
 while the Ygg were charging at them in full force.
 Parcifal readied Encelados while Lernea stood their ground, never showing
 whether or not it mattered to them that the Ygg now seemed to be impervious
 to damage.
 Winceham got up and and put his pipe in his vest's pocket, looking quite
 pissed at not being able to smoke in peace.
 The two boys looked at Master Sisyphus as his lips began to whisper words
 they had never heard before.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon said to his friend and shrugged casually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo jumped right in front of the staff then, at the exact moment a thin,
 steady line of light not thicker than a hair's breadth shot through her.
 And then a surge of power and light created a sphere of magnificent light,
 crackling with a never seen before force surrounded Bo and Sisyphus.
 In a frozen bubble of time, the sphere expanded, shining with a light that
 tore shadows apart, shredding them to pieces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once it reached the boundaries of the Ygg crystal, the sphere of light collapsed
 in a single point centered at Bo.
 The next moment, a brilliant blinding white light exploded from the bunny,
 engulfing the lake, the crystal, and everyone else in a miniature sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Higher above the lake, in the clouds, Judith saw the fiery explosion of

\begin_layout Standard
Ned opened his eyes lazily; he saw a stone-crafted ceiling, rough but elegantly
 put together, each piece of stone fitting, well-placed.
 Soft, golden-hued light bathed the room he was in from a wide-arched, paned-gla
ss window which lay half-open.
 He felt the mattress comfortably hugging his body; he felt tired, his muscles
 aching for stillness.
 He heard the chirruping sound of birds at a distance.
 He put his hands on his belly, above the soft beddings and felt content
 just by being there.
 He remembered the terrible white that occluded every other sense, and the
 thought of perhaps being dead entered his head.
 He stared vacantly at the ceiling for a moment, uninterested in the sparse
 fittings of the room; there was a simple bedside table where a jar stood
 and a low wooden table with an empty candlestick.
 And that was that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then heard the door to the room swing open; the face of a woman appeared
 through it timidly, as if he was being pried upon.
 He had no recollection of seeing her again, but her face was elven-like
 in its appearance.
 Silver-haired with a face of simple, elegant beauty, she presented herself
 fully; she wore linen, heavy robes of a dark brown, starkly contrasted
 with her milky skin.
 If she had been wearing white, he'd tempted to think once more he had died
 and this was what angels looked like.
 She smiled at him tentatively and bringing her palms together awkwardly,
 she spoke with a girly voice that made her impossible not to like.

 Sisyphus nodded and sipped quietly.

And Bo, the bunny, turned back into a human,

 Ned continued, underlying his words by tapping a hand softly on the meat-laden
 table.
 Sisyphus nodded once more, after pausing to think for a moment.

And you don't remember how any of it happened exactly?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked with worry in his voice.
 Master Sisyphus cleared his throat before answering: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What I can clearly remember is that I used the Metathaumaturgic device as
 a Resonating Amplifier for a powerful disintegration spell, just when Bo
 got in the way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So you kind of disintegrated her? Along with the huge crystal the Ygg had
 been built?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked sounding rather concerned about what had happened to the crystal.
 He then heard Judith's voice as she pulled the empty, heavy, thick-built
 chair beside him and sat down.

A major victory.
 Quick, with little to no losses at all.
 Decisive, informative.
 Diplomatically convenient.
 One for the history books,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said smiling confidently and eyed the table, searching for a specific,
 choice-cut of meat.

I hear the Dwelvar sausage is quite spicy and juicy, lady Judith,

 Master Sisyphus said and smiled.

Judith!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned couldn't help but say her name, sounding inappropriately superfluous
 and a bit dumb in his overjoyed response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said nodding and reached for a sausage.
 There were dozens of long, not very practical tables like this one around
 the dining hall, but everyone seemed to be in good spirits since food and
 drink was available aplenty.
 It was as if the world-eating menace of the Ygg had been but a mild inconvenien
ce long past dealt with.

That was some very good timing with the Bellerephon,

 Ned said nodding, looking at Judith in a searching, gracious manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was luck, mostly.
 But I should thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she replied, and took a bite off the sausage, munching at in a manner that
 would have Lernea baulking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked with a curious smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

For trusting in me.
 For pushing me to do something I thought I wasn't supposed to,

 she replied after swallowing.

\begin_layout Standard

You mean, commanding a battleship?

 Ned asked.

No.
 You pushed me into believing in a cause,

 she replied earnestly, and took another bite off the sausage.

 Parcifal interrupted harshly as she came between Ned and Judith.
 They looked at her with a confused look of mild horror, before she understood
 they were thinking she was being serious.

It was a joke,

 she said and smiled harmlessly.

Ned should've picked it up,

 she added.

Frankly, it was crass and rather insulting,

 he replied with a frown.

Exactly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Parcifal said and looking rather fresh and shiny in an exquisitely crafted
 armor of her own, turned about and left.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Have a drink on me.
 It is well deserved.
 And try to keep Winceham sober,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she reminded Ned with a knowing look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I think she insulted my abilities as a comedian,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said.
 Sisyphus nodded, agreeing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, thoroughly so.
 Though I hardly know you, Ned, you don't strike me as an especially funny
 person, if you don't mind my being frank.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's not true.

 Ned said shaking his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Exactly.
 The point is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said appearing on the other side of the table from underneath
 it, trying to stand on his chair without toppling it over, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He is not Frank.
 His name is Sysopas,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Winceham said and blinked furiously, grinning like a horse on a selling
 display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Sisyphus,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the wizened old wizard and scholar corrected him without showing any feelings

That one, whatever it is, is not Frank.
 I know a Frank when I sees one, right love?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said and shot Judith a look that was supposed to be suave and
 charming, while in effect it was rather disconcerting as it made Winceham
 look like someone who had spent years trying to recover from a brain injury.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hifs brunk, ind't he?

 Judith stopped eating and said with half her mouth full.

It's a condition.
 He's not exactly drunk,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and nodded apologetically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A loud gong was heard then suddenly, its ringing reverberating across the
 large dining hall.
 It struck three times, before a loud, stentorian voice announced emphatically:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now hear ye! Hear ye! Her Magnificent Eminence, First Among Equals, Scion
 of House Teletha, Protector of the Realm and Ascendant to the Holy Mountain,
 Queen Lernea, the True!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did so, Lernea appeared from behind a wide-arched doorway, Parcifal
 behind her, both of them looking exquisite, majestic in their armor while
 kind and honorable in their demeanor, as they eyed the room with an elevated
 sense of duty.
 The guests, hundreds of them, rose from their seats and bowed in total
 silence.
 It didn't look like a sign of subservience; it rather looked like sincere,
 deep gratitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood by a thick piece of stone, carved in the semblance of a stool
 or a low chair placed in the very head of the large hall, but she did not
 seat.
 Parcifal stood right beside her, not a step behind.
 They both scanned the dining hall with bright, gleaming eyes; a thin smile
 underlined Lernea's words, while Parcifal looked a lot more cheerful than
 she had been for the past few days.

It hasn't been that long if we were to measure time by the rising and the
 falling of the sun.
 Yet to me, it felt like a long, arduous journey, until I could set foot
 again in my home; not as a runaway traitor, or an oath-breaking coward,
 but as the one true rightful ruler of the Kingdom of Nomos,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said calmly, and took a breath filled with relief.

I stand here before you, and I can hardly recognise most of you lords and
 ladies.
 I know though that where your allegiance lies; it lies not in me, and not
 in my family.
 It lies in the laws of our great Kingdom, it lies in the rules of the Holy
 Mountain and the values of our forefathers.
 That is the very heart and essence of our being, our way of life and our
 code of honor.
 For without law and honor, we are but beasts made to look like men.
 Without fairness and goodness of heart, we are but tools to be used, wielded
 by our darker nature,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said with a crystal clear, strong voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I came to realise, perhaps too late for comfort, how a far darker thing
 is out there, brooding, scheming.
 It is an evil of many faces, but one name: the Ygg,

 Lernea said and the crowd of guests sounded uneasy, uttering prayers of
 protection.
 Lernea paused for a moment before she went on.

Good fortune and the guiding light of Svarna showed me the True Path; with
 Skrala's might and the help of my friends, we were able to save our Kingdom,

 slaves and our world a smoldering wreck, a breeding pit for more evil to
 pour into the universe.

And that is why I must take leave of my reigning duties, for now.
 Because I cannot, and will not rest, until this scourge is nothing but
 a memory, a footprint in the annals of our time.
 Haste is of paramount importance; there are certain things that have been
 put in motion which must be acted upon now, lest the tide turns once more
 against us.
 I have trust in you to carry on your duties like you have always done,
 obeying the laws and listening to the heart of the Holy Mountain.
 We will have the aid of our newly-found allies, bonded in the heat of battle,
 the proud alliance of human worlds, the Human League.

A silence filled by lonely whispers dominated the hall.
 Lernea sighed and continued, her voice ringing throughout the walls of

It is thus why I name Winceham Higginsbottom Abbermouth the Third, of House

 May the light of Svarna shine on your path, Viceroy Winceham, and Skrala
 lend his hand where your righteous fist may fall,

 her, having great difficulty containing her laughter.

You're leaving for a place called Noymansland, tomorrow.
 You need to find Theo's and Bo's father; he probably holds the key to the

 This is a lot larger than Nomos, Mr.

 You're in a unique position to possibly save all life as we know it,

 Sisyphus said and ran his tongue across his lips, before downing the rest
