John was the best I'd ever seen with a blowtorch.
 He wielded it like Da Vinci wielded a god-damn paintbrush.
 He could do things with it that in many places were certainly illegal and
 could even be considered deranged, with the possible exception of Japan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was this thing about John and the blue-hot propane flames that bordered
 - nay, even surpassed - the realm of wonder.
 If Jesus could come down and visit from the Heavens and work with a blowtorch
 next to John, he'd look like some kind of a pyromaniac hobo with a messiah
 complex and a background in carpentry, while John would just shine with
 a bright white light emanating from within, being able to turn water into
 beer and beer into piss with just a
\shape italic
 look
\shape default
.
 John was just 
\shape italic
that
\shape default
 good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it was a fucking bummer when I learned that his last words actually were:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't be a pussy, oxygen tanks do that hissing sound all the time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as classifying bummers goes, this was a triple-A class bummer, the
 kind of showstopper that had only been 
\lang british
theorised
\lang english
 up to John's untimely and gruesome death.
 The kind of bummer that could have made Jim Carey's face look flat and
 emotionless.
 It ranked way far above the A-plus bummer of being recently divorced, fired,
 being fired upon and being set on fire at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which was bad in and of itself, but not as bad as John getting blown up
 a day before the `job'.
 That was a sad state of affairs that meant I was now a very sorry son of
 a bitch with a life expectancy that made the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lifetime warranty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 an almost moot point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here I was, melting away in a decrepit diner on route 72, at a swampy
 nowhere with some supposedly native American though actually gibberish
 name like 'Alatanoosa' or 'Whahananoka'.
 It was between Alabama and Tennessee, which to me was pretty much the same.
 The coffee tasted like imported dirt; the kind of dirt you read about being
 very fashionable and exaggeratedly overpriced but at the end of the day,
 was just plain old dirt anyway you looked at it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fried eggs looked like fried eggs, but only in the most rudimentary
 way: there was an orange bit with some sort of white substance with the
 mechanical properties of rubber all around it.
 I guess my flair for adventure was wearing out so it just sat there, while
 I happily failed to ingest it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It didn't take me much time to realise I really didn't feel like eating
 at all.
 Maybe it was the god-damn heat, the stale humid air and the fact that about
 the same time the next day, I would be probably looking at the wrong end
 of more than a couple of gun barrels because I had been forced into something
 I couldn't deliver by some very single-minded people with a propensity
 for shooting, rather than having coffee and biscuits and sympathizing with
 the occasional bad card life dealt you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason I couldn't deliver was I couldn't do the `job'.
 And I couldn't do the `job' without John, because John, the flamboyant
 blowtorch virtuoso with an unmatched record of ninety-two safes, safe-rooms,
 and bank vaults; an average time of three point three minutes, clean as
 a germ-obsessed placebo-munching single old lady right before kidney stone
 surgery and a no-smoking-on-the-job policy that kept my cigarette budget
 intact, had gone and killed himself in his brother's-in-law chop shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stopped and asked myself at that point whether that unfortunate death,
 at such a bad time, right before what would probably prove to be the last
 gig in my career was a sign from God to stop doing what I did best: stealing.
 In a rare know-thyself moment I reminded myself I wasn't half as good at
 it as those folks in Wall Street, most politicians and the let-me-lend-you-your
-own-money cutthroats that roamed the street unabashed, calling themselves
 bankers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logic would then imply that if there was going to be any smiting and all
 that holier-than-thou business, any God with a sense of perspective, morality
 and justice wouldn't start dishing it out on my end.
 And in any case, I decided that if God really had something to tell me,
 he'd better make a really good point with lots of compelling arguments,
 like saving my ass, pronto.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or at least point me to a direction, show me the road to salvation that
 preferably led somewhere warm and sandy in the Pacific, along with a couple
 of bank accounts in the Caymans, some instantly gratifying plastic surgery
 and twelve hundred different driving licenses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Realising how God and reality rarely intertwined, I felt an emotional pressure
 the likes of which I hadn't experienced since high-school and all the awkward
 parties that went with it.
 A stress relief mechanism kicked in somewhere inside me and I sighed deeply
 before shouting out an expletive, something eloquent like `Fuck!'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That made some heads in the diner turn, eyebrows raised apprehensively.
 It also gained me the attention of the establishment's chef-du-cuisine;
 a six-foot-three, two-hundred and fifty pound red-haired, bush-bearded
 wild-eyed man-like Alabaman, more creature than man, with a meat cleaver,
 a stained apron and a murderous gleam in his eye.
 He pointed that cleaver towards my direction and said with a slight snarl

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I nodded faintly and muttered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I should.
 I'm sorry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in an absent-minded fashion before I put ten bucks on the table, got up
 and left.
 He probably felt that'd given me a good old fashioned run-down, but it
 was high time I'd left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at my watch, one of the few items I had actually bought with honest
 money from a winning lottery ticket back when I kept saying to myself that
 heists were `a temporary thing'.
 It was half past ten in the morning, and I had more or less twenty two
 and a half hours to live.
 As I looked at the bland, flat, moist, green and brown Southern scenery,
 I noticed a couple of dogs humping without a care in the world, oblivious
 to pretty much everything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to think something profound about nature and the will of life
 to survive and continue, when I noticed they both had 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stuff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dangling underneath.
 Even nature had a way of giving me the finger.
 I looked up into the blighting sun for just a moment, and all I could see
 was white and red dots for the next couple of minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd left my glasses inside the diner.
 I said to myself, `fuck that, I don't need sunglasses.
 I'm going to do what it takes, and I sure as hell can do it without sunglasses.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, thinking back to that particular moment in time, the moment I decided
 to act was the moment I kept thinking to myself `Bobby, that doesn't mean
 shit.
 John blowing up doesn't mean shit.
 You can still do this.
 You can still get rich, or die trying,' that must have been the moment
 that would probably get the most votes in the `Most Regrettable Moment
 in Your Entire Life' category.
 It would also get lots of points in the `Shit I Wish I Hadn't Done' category,
 but the real winner in that one was calling up Eileen.
 I'd done mistakes before, but it always amazed me how impossibly fast I
 regretted calling Eileen on that particular day.
 I panicked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I rang her three times before she picked it up.
 When she did, it sounded like she hadn't talked to a real person in about
 three years, give or take:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmbby? Mmmby Baahow? My Bobby Bear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took little notice of the fact that she had been apparently stuffing herself,
 probably having a bad case of the munchies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, Eileen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 managing to keep my tone of voice even, normal-sounding.
 It really felt like biting the bullet when I said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's me, Papa-Bear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It also made me cringe as the connotations that old term of endearment
 implied flashed across my mind's eye.
 Jesus Christ, not Eileen.
 What was I doing? Was there no other way? Was this a possible way out or
 was it just a faster way under?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Awwww, Papa-Bear..
 Is this really you Bobby? I miss you so much, you know.
 Where have you been all these days?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded quite sincere but then again crazy people always do sound sincere,
 especially those that do believe you are actually an ursine humanoid, complete
 with fur, claws, a fluffy tummy, and possessed by an unhealthy hunger for
 honey and tacos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, Eileen.
 That's, me..
 Yeah.
 Papa-waka-bear.
 Uhm..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words seemed to be drip-fed to my brain from some sort of mental black
 hole that spewed forth nothing that made sense.
 Fortunately, that seemed to strongly resonate with Eileen's warped sense
 of reality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, Papa-waka-bear, so strong and furry and manly..
 With lots and lots of furry shoulder hair for me to rub and that sweet
 tummy..
 Can I see you Bobby? Just this once, I won't be a bother, really.
 We don't need to go boat-pedaling or skating.
 Just see you, maybe let me rub your tummy? And have animal sex together?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I closed my eyes and recalled a picture from the past: myself laden with
 honey from tip to toe, tied to a bed with a Winnie the Pooh plushie wearing
 a strap-on dildo and Eileen shouting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rawr! I'm your honeycomb slice, Papa-Bear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I decided then and there that I'd have to appeal to whatever core of sanity
 remained in her mind, or else I could just go drown myself in a really
 shallow body of water, like, say, a gutter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Listen, Eileen..
 We can't..
 I can't do all that, okay? I wish I could, but..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was a lie.
 That was a lie.
 That was a lie.
 I was lying to her, but that was okay cause she was crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ohh.
 Why can't you Papa-Bear? We could have so much fun together! We could ride
 the tram around the city, and I could feed you cotton candy and berries.
 Like last time, don't you remember? Didn't you have fun that time? Please,
 Bobby.
 Can't I see you once more? Why did you call me then? Do you really want
 to hurt me, Bobby? Is that it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her voice reminded me uncannily of Boy George and that made my eyes hurt
 just by thinking about it.
 I felt my stomach knot at the thought of all the things I would have to
 endure to get on her good side.
 Or it might have been the coffee-like dirt-brew from the diner.
 I took a deep breath before uttering the words as if they were my last:
\end_layout

I need to see you Eileen.

 outside the window and flying to your arms, Papa-Bear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh God, shit no.
 She was crazy enough to actually pop out the window and crack her head
 open on the street below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No, no, Eileen! Don't do that honey, no.
 You gotta wait a couple of hours, I'll drop by your place.

No, no! Just sit tight, will ya? I'll bring you some chocolate chip cookies,

Oh, you mean those horrible pills? They were so bitter and bad for me; unlike

 Your little nightingale.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was probably wrong.
 No meds; rampant insanity mixed with nymphomaniac tendencies.
 And ursine fantasies.
 For a moment I thought it'd be a better bet to just reason with Falconi,
 but the fact that the last guy who tried that ended up as a collection
 of hand-made soap bars with Falconi's signature on it left me with little
 doubt about where my chances lay.
 I'd stick with the looney.
 At least she seemed to still have this thing for me.

Okaaay, Eileen.
 Now, see Papa-Bear's in trouble and I need your help.
 So, make sure you can get a hold of daddy and tell him that you might need

I hesitated just for the tiniest moment and I could almost picture the sad,
 watery eyes and then the coming onslaught of cries, curses and finely sharpened
 blades being hurled against me, so I made something like a smooching sound.
 It might have sounded like a fart, I'm not sure, but she sounded positively
 satisfied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hang up in the nick of time.
 The ordeal was over for now, but doubts started assaulting me like journalists
 outside a rehab facility for famous people.
 Was this my only option? Would she come through? What if she had been waiting
 for that call, that one call that I might have given her in such a time
 of extenuating circumstances and dire need, just so I could come running
 to her for help and then dice me up because I had shot the best-man on
 our wedding day and ran off in her father's Porsche?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had to keep reminding myself I wasn't the bad person here, even as I strode
 back into my piece-of-shit Taurus.
 These were desperate times, and they obviously required insanely desperate
 measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got back on route 72, heading for Memphis.
 While the radio waves reeked with country, bluegrass and heart-felt messages
 to the parishioners to pledge their support to the Church of Latter Day
 Saints With Semi-Automatic Rifles, I casually gazed outside the window
 and couldn't help notice that this countryside was so flat and uninteresting
 that if there was some kind of hell waiting for everyone, this would be
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to start a self-gratifying rant, using phrases like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job right there, Bobby
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure I can vouch for that sleazeball Mr.
 Falconi

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Heck no, nothing can go wrong, we're all pros here.
 Right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when a big brown legged thing just popped right in front of the Taurus.
 I applied pressure to the braking pedal and then the laws of physics worked
 their magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, despite appearances I'm a fairly well-educated man and I know that
 Taurus is just a fancy word for bull.
 I also know that for a car to decelerate from eighty miles-per-hour to
 zero, it takes a couple hundred feet, and that's because no-one in his
 right mind would design a car that could turn its occupants into mush or
 tarmac jelly (depending on the seat belt arrangement) when they wanted
 it to stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, I wasn't really surprised when the Taurus hit that horse.
 I wasn't really surprised when the airbag tried to rob me of what looked
 like my early dying breath.
 Surprise wasn't achieved even when the car swiveled and landed sideways
 in a gravely ditch.
 It wasn't the fact that I was still in one piece, nor the fact that the
 horse - had it been given the oral faculty post-mortem - could not say
 the same for itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the shaman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There I was, still trying to decide whether or not I was still alive and
 with my brain firmly between my ears, when I saw through the hazy smoke
 and vapor of the smashed front of the car the figure of a lone man, looking
 directly at me with a deeply sombre gaze, as if I had just killed his horse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was dressed in a brown leather jacket, crisscrossed leather vest, and
 soft tan shoes.
 I'd have wagered he was some kind of a disco enthusiast with a slightly
 bent sexual orientation, if it wasn't for the feathery hat and the somewhat
 austere, manly jaw line.
 He was the spitting image of some Cherokee.
 Or Navajo.
 I didn't know, I just knew there are cars named after these kinds of people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spoke with a peculiar voice that had the impossible qualities of gravel
 and running water at the same time:

\begin_layout Standard
I would normally have taken the time to think about faking some injury so
 I could sue the guy for damages.
 But under the circumstances, namely that I was planning on disappearing
 forever, combined with this guy's entire estate most probably consisting
 of a dead horse, a tipi and his grandparents in a convenient form of ash,
 I instinctively opted for the truth.
 Every limb felt connected to the proper slots and I literally (and sadly,
 figuratively as well) saw no great blinding light at the end of a tunnel.

He came closer, shook open my jammed door and helped me get out of the car.
 He struck me as neither too old and neither too young, kind of exactly

 My impending doom, and a horse dying in front of Taurus.
 Could it be that somehow the cosmic forces of life contrived to tell me
 something? Had some sort of karmic exchange taken place right in front
 of my eyes? A horse's life, for my own? An offering, a sacrifice to the
 powers beyond reach? Was he a holy man? Some sort of shaman? An emissary
 of fate? Was this the break I so desperately needed?

The truck driver's name was Ivan Kerrilov, and when he spoke he never failed

I tried to maintain a conversational tone without giving away the fact that

 So I tried to reply:

With safety in mind first, and without taking his eyes off the road, Ivan
 took his hand off the wheel and made two little figures with his fingers
 that first walked casually next to each other, and then one seemed to bend
 over only to get the index finger of the other hand repeatedly inserted
 into an imaginary cavity.
 At first I squinted at the little charade, trying to think what could be
 going on in Ivan's stranger-than-fiction-mind.
 But when I saw his leery smile and rhythmical movement of his pelvis I
 irreversibly knew he was asking whether or not me and Steve were a `thing'.
 I answered as delicately as appearances and circumstances allowed:

 asked Steve without provocation and without a care, delving deep into the
 insides of the truck's dashboard and assorted interior extras, like the
 small cupboard in the back and the impossibly tiny WC.
 I had seen where this kind of talk could lead and I always regretted rising
 to the bait.
 I resolved not to be tempted, especially then, and especially in that uncomfort

A really big truck with a streamlined design overtook us on the left, blaring
 his horn all the way.
 At the end of the huge tank it was carrying, the driver had put up a neon
 sign that said `HONK IF YOU'RE HUNG LIKE AN ARMADILLO'.
 Before my brain had time to fully explore the possibilities that such a
 statement entailed and what it really meant (for instance, what is an armadillo
 hung like? Is it hung like an anteater or some other animal beginning with
 an `a'?), I was reflexively covering up my ears because Ivan had just honked,
 laughing like an immigrant version of Woody Woodpecker.
 On the other hand, I noticed Steve was browsing through the mini-bar, which
 seemed to contain enough alcohol to launch an amateur rocket into orbit.
 Most of the tiny bottles were empty and the rest of them were strewn around

See now, that's typical behavior for a male with a repressed sexuality.
 You have a problem opening up to society as a homosexual man, so you become
 defensive; you try to look like the dominating male figure, while in fact
 you subconsciously chose to hitch a hike with an outspokenly gay man, in
 a milk truck no less.
 Just a moment ago admitted you're worse at sucking cock than most women.
 And that's why you punched me, because in this soul-searching quest you
 are too confined by your own-
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I punched him again, and this time it had the desired effect.
 He stopped talking shit and looked at me through half-open wary eyes, probably
 mindful that some things, and especially things concerning my manliness
 were better left unsaid for a good reason; a reason that involved jarred
 bones, bruises and broken teeth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was visibly seething with anger.
 My male pride had been hurt.
 I almost felt like a proud elk being stripped of its horns, an elephant
 without a trunk, or a stud without its junk.
 It also felt like Ivan was eying me creepily, and grinning incongruously
 to every mention of a word even remotely related to intercourse, like `milk',
 `butter', or `hoe'.
 Before abject terror pulled at my instincts and made me leap outside a
 truck doing eighty on the interstate, he turned and said to me with an
 approving tone, proudly waving a badly groomed finger in the air:

Steve looked slightly miffed, sitting somewhat uncomfortably, nursing his
 jaw.
 It looked like the last punch had left him a purple-coloured souvenir.
 It's only reasonable then that he must've unwillingly disconnected his
 mouth from his brain when he said:

I was about to punch him a third time in that exact same, bruised sweet
 spot and if God was a proponent of applied justice, I would have broken
 his jaw with the added bonus that that would have probably made him shut
 up for the rest of the ordeal.
 But I suddenly felt something with the apparent magnitude and force of
 a giant metal claw tugging at my left shoulder.
 It was Ivan who said:

 moment had arrived.
 We were about to meet Eileen.
 Which reminded me then to finish what I had started, so I punched Steve
 in the face.
 A moment, a grunt and an expletive later he was complaining:

 the other way.
 He then said with conviction:

I'm not a violent man per se, and it definitely says something for a person
 when he's so eager to punch people in the face and break their legs, but
 in Steve's case, I would bet he could get the Pope mad enough to beat him
 to death with a bible.
 Before there was time to choke him to death, Ivan effectively disarmed
 me with but a few words that carried a very special meaning:

 I looked at Steve in terror and he simply smiled back, impervious to what
 the words implied for my gender.
 Impossibly, trying to ignore the inevitable I smiled back as well and thought
 that staying alive had its good moments, and its rape moments.
 This looked like a rape moment.
 For some inexplicable reason, all I could think of was Nirvana and Kodak.

By that time I had mastered my instincts and even though a proper response

Steve shrugged and rang the bell.
 We were standing in the front porch of Eileen's house, a three-story typical
 southern mansion that reeked of money.
 If I closed my eyes I could almost hear 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and smell the corn.
 A moment or two passed.
 Nothing happened while we waited.
 I was looking at the old, thick wooden door idly.
 Steve rang the bell once more.
 Still, the buzz didn't come.
 So we exchanged a couple of knowing looks; I looked under the door mat
 while Steve picked up a couple of plant pots and looked underneath.
 Nothing.
 No key.

The intercom spewed some static as she hang up.
 The door buzzed and I pushed it open.
 We got inside and a powerful smell assaulted me: the smell of a shitload
 of money.
 The large entrance hall was just as I remembered.
 Stately, sparkling clean, filled with incredibly expensive luxury items
 chosen solely because of their price tag.
 There was this wide staircase that led to the upper floors, all marble
 and carpet.
 Pretty standard stuff for a cotton mogul like Eileen's father.

\begin_layout Standard
And that was when I caught Eileen with the corner of my eye, falling down
 on me from the floor above, wearing a free-fall jumpsuit, arms outstretched
 looking uncannily similar to a flying squirrel on drugs, ready to clench
 me into her death-love-grip.
 The inane sight made me freeze like an idiot, so I couldn't dodge her in
 time.
 She simply fell right on top of me and we both fell on the floor.
 I was pretty certain I heard something crack, and while I tried to breathe
 again, I heard Steven's voice carrying the unmistakable markings of someone
 on a cocktail of psychedelic drugs:

 with a fizz before starting to slightly ooze out of its bag and on the
 floor, quite without reason.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said trying to sound approving, even as I tried to squirm away from her.
 I took a look at Steve and it seemed like he was starting to develop some
 sort of real mental issue.
 He was hugging the walls, mumbling something inaudible and had the look
 of a wide-eyed deer frozen by a couple of approaching headlights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I managed to stand back up after a while, while Eileen continuously expressed
 her endearment, handling me like a stuffed animal and calling me `booby-woompy'
, `etch-a-sketchy' and `orgasmatron two', among other things.
 Before I could find a way to calm her down enough to try and tell her why
 we were there, Steve finally blew a fuse and lost his marbles as if Eileen's
 condition was as catchy as the Ebola virus:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to punch him again just as a stop-gap measure, when I saw Eileen
 had quickly acclimatized herself to the added craziness: she was doing
 her best ninja impression, with a length of the parachute wrapped around
 her face as a mask, wielding a three-pronged candle holder like some sort
 of dagger, dancing around, blinking wildly and generally looking very much
 like a deranged person rather than a ninja.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I realised I now had two instead of just one nutcases to handle, and they
 were helping each other turn me into one of them.
 I tried to fold Steve back into some kind of reality that might not involve
 invisible ninja assassins.
 I grabbed him by the shoulders and unglued him from the wall, trying to
 say something that might make him see sense:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Maybe you ate something bad on the road? That sandwich? Maybe you put some

His face looked like splitting for just a moment.
 He then blurted:

No chance! Peyote tastes like rabbit pee, that sandwich tasted like snake

 he said and Eileen shove herself into view with an aerial kick that managed
 to overturn a small

 It also cost me my meager grip on Steve who just snapped at exactly the

They're here, man! We got to torch this place! Let me go man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, kicked me in the nuts and ran away while I collapsed in agony,
 seeing bright spots of many vivid colours and what might have been the
 faint image of a nun wearing a bikini and shorts.
 As I lay down on a Persian carpet feeling my balls secede and declare their
 independence, my gaze unwillingly locked out of focus at what must've been
 an original Trego, and had this had happened to someone else, I'd find
 the coincidence quite charming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen was all over me in the blink of an eye.
 Her eyes looked watery already and she shrieked right into my ear with
 the overtones of a caring nympho:

While it might've been a welcome change in pace, I had to gather my wits,
 so I motioned a definite `no' while I felt blood circulation slowly return

I still lay there panting though, unable to fathom how I'd put myself in
 a situation that involved a crazy woman and a recently acquainted bona

 It really felt like a balls-to-the-wall moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt Eileen was doing something really awkward to my hair and then I saw
 she was tasting it, an all too well-known dominating her features.
 I knew then I needed to get up, knock some sense into Steve, preferably
 force-feeding him some of Eileen's leftover meds that were bound to be
 found somewhere around the house.
 The developments though, outpaced me, when Steve came back into view shouting:

He looked every bit as mad as a mad scientist of native American heritage
 would, complete with his feathery hat on and wildly unkempt hair.
 Eileen was still hunched right beside me, tracing the carpet with a finger,
 probably unable to understand why there were no puddles ripping outwards
 from the fluffy sea.

Once more in my life, I felt I was on the forefront of modern psychiatric
 analysis and treatment.
 What made things a little different, a bit more urgent and a lot more dangerous
 than what mental illness professionals faced (more aptly, blabbermouths
 with a degree and an all-you-can-eat LSD buffet at work), was that gas
 is notoriously known for a tendency to make things explode in flames.
 I just used, plain, simple, hard logic to try and put things under control
 before it was too late.
 I simply told Steve what I thought of the whole situation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I tried to picture such a pink, fiendishly devious ninja for a moment, but
 thankfully I failed.
 I tried to make Steve see things my way:

\begin_layout Standard

Okay, let's just pretend this place needed some cleansing, and you went

\begin_layout Standard
Steve held up a handful of nuts, bolts and valves that looked very out of

 I kept my cool and asked him without trembling, at least not visibly.

\begin_layout Standard

What about that sparkle Steve? You'd have to light it up somehow, man.
 You wouldn't be that crazy, say lighting up a match now, would you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I heard Eileen's syrupy voice coming from the direction of the
 kitchen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Papa-bear? Why didn't you say your tummy was empty? I could've cooked you

 Bobby!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I tried to make sense of that statement, Steve said the most sensible
 thing I had heard out of his mouth in quite some time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just run!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had this awkward sensation tingling inside my gut.
 Time seemed to flow much more gently suddenly.
 And I think I started running like some kind of wild animal that sees the
 fires approaching, consuming everything, and flees.
 Only for some inexplicable reason, I wasn't fleeing.
 I wasn't running outside the house.
 I ran inside the kitchen, and saw Eileen happily glued in front of the
 microwave with the tin foil inside, waiting for the timer to reach zero.
 In the sparse few seconds that I envisaged I had yet to live, I grabbed
 her by the waist and carried her outside like a brat about to get a thorough
 beating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't paying thorough attention but I believe she was laughing her heart
 out, flapping her outstretched arms like we were head-showing a very cheap
 production of The Valkyrie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I passed through the open door, I could see Steve running in front of
 me, and realised his athletic scholarship wasn't just some bullshit he'd
 made up.
 I saw the courtyard, and beyond that I could see the path leading to the
 road, and when I felt this giant hand push me up in the air with an urgency
 that belied its deadliness, I realised the bird's-eye view is highly overrated
 and quite unpleasant if one does not possess the ability to land safely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fraction of a second later my ears were ravaged by the sound of the explosion
 that had propelled me and Eileen into the air.
 I had just enough time to think that it was a really shitty thing to die
 about a day earlier than you were supposed to, right before my face connected
 with the dirt horribly and everything went pitch black with a terrible
 thud.

I could see the fire trucks and the sheriff's office had done their part,
 and had extinguished the fire.
 The mansion had turned into a very big piece of charcoal, and we were safely

 looking as innocent as any picnickers.
 The mansion was pretty much far off the road, so there weren't really any
 bystanders or eye-witnesses, and that only meant it would merely be a matter

 paused and turned around looking at me like there was overwhelming evidence
 of something weird going on.

I suddenly could move again as if some invisible cords had just snapped.
 I flexed my muscles as if they had been brand new again, and then I dutifully

 get down to the road and maybe hail a cab.

I think I frowned really hard when I heard that, almost trying to connect
 one eyebrow with the other.
 I was inclined to ask Steve about his thoughts on the strategy of preemptive
 strikes in general, colloquially known as `shoot first, ask questions later',
 and in this particular instance `punch first, then punch again'.
 But somehow I felt it would be a very counterproductive thing to do, at
 least until this situation with Eileen had been resolved.
 I'm pretty sure my teeth made a grinding noise when I said:

Steve cleared his throat and settled into a calm, even voice.
 It was what could have passed as the voice of a narrator in a boring documentar

 Speaking from experience though, it was just Steve, indirectly admitting
 he was a rather huge asshole:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Part of the ritual involves letting the spirits run wild, and free.
 Best way to do that, is make you act like yourself, speak from the heart
 if you will.
 Normally, we would have spend weeks together in the wild, hunting, bonding,
 perhaps bathing naked in ice cold streams, with nothing but the cloudy
 sky for a roof and our knives for shelter.
 The light of the stars would have shone in our souls, and our spirits would
 mingle with the Father Wind, the changer of all things not set in stone.
 And you would learn to feel the currents of Mother Earth flow within you,
 all living things as one force, separate but not divided, unique but not
 alone.
 And your spirit would be ready then.
 But because we had to do this real quick, I improvised and nearly killed
 us all.
 It worked better than I expected.

We soon reached the side of the road, and I saw a sign right across the
 other side advertising cheap food, strong coffee and liquor, and I quote:
 `fit for pharmaceutical use'.
 I was genuinely surprised then to see Steve wet his lips with his tongue,
 and look at me with an expression that verged on what I believe mental
 health professionals (yeah, the overpaid quacks) call bipolar disorder.
 The left part of his face was contorted in a jarred grimace, the kind of
 mess that happens to your face when you realise you've put yourself into
 a situation that can only result in abject, petrifying horror or death-of-the-s
oul (kinda like visiting the in-laws or watching the eight o'clock news).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other half, his right half, shone with the intensity and brilliance
 of a miniscule sun, as if the skin was made from the same stuff as the
 stars (which - technically speaking - is of course true), the same kind
 of face that an alcoholic makes at the first whiff of anything ending -

I was getting the impression that Eileen's spirit was somehow different,
 yet the same, from the `Crazy' Eileen I'd known.
 It felt like her, but without the craziness.
 It somehow felt right, kinda made me feel a little bad too.
 But all in all, I was quite optimistic even though I had less than twenty
 hours to live, the spirit of my ex-wife was trapped in my body, and I was
 resting my hopes on a ghost and a shaman with a drinking problem.

\begin_layout Standard
Mama Adele had laid out a really delicate tablecloth, the color of blinding
 white.
 A small feast had been laid out on the table, and the overpowering smell
 of freshly baked cornbread filled the small, homely kitchen.
 Steve was sitting opposite me, hesitant to start eating, constantly flicking
 his gaze between Mama Adele, me, and his plate.
 I was playing around with my fork, trying to appear as I was ready to start
 eating at any moment, while in fact I was classifying the potatoes on my
 plate according to size, shape, and complexion (an old habit I inherited
 while doing time in prison - it really helped with trying to not think
 about the showers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen's body was upstairs, comfortably lying in bed.
 Even though I could use a bit of a nap myself at that point, there was
 very little precious time to waste, and Mama Adele did not help things
 by insisting that we sat down and had supper.
 When she saw Eileen was out cold it seemed as if someone had pulled away
 the world under her feet.
 We told her half of the truth: some kind of trouble, the mansion burned
 to the ground, Eileen knocked unconscious, safe and sound but in need of
 rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She'd known the line of business I was in and that I've had some shady dealings
 in the past, and that her father wasn't exactly a virgin in the domain
 of law-breaking, so she knew that whatever it was I had gotten her into,
 a hospital would be a bad idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
God bless her soul, she grudgingly took us in, on two conditions nevertheless:
 one, that we'd sit down, eat supper, have some coffee, a nice long talk
 and perhaps a couple of beatings.
 Two, if Eileen didn't wake up soon, she'd put a curse on me so vile, that
 I'd wish I'd never been conceived, much less born, and so evil, that'd
 make the devil and all his minions look like pussies (these were, to my
 recollection, her exact words).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was known to have experience in the ju-ju crafts and a cabinet full
 of all sorts of dead animal parts, as well as all the spunk and the ferocity
 of a really old black lady that had raised Eileen like she had been her
 own.
 Her dry wrinkled face nevertheless sported piercing cougar-like eyes, and
 if looks could kill, hers would have been a weapon of mass destruction.
 I noticed she was eying me with just that kind of a look, and while Eileen
 inside me urged me once more to tell her the truth, before I could open
 my mouth and speak a single word, she motioned me to stay silent, waving
 a bony arthritis-swollen finger and saying:

Steve shot me a look of surprise, like a rabbit popping up from his hiding
 place only to find out the hunting season is still on.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but Mama Adele still had the advantage and
 it didn't look like she was going to give it up anytime soon.
 She put up one hand with a warning finger that made us pause and watch
 as she unbuttoned her blouse with the other hand, slowly and decisively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normally the sight of a - probably senile - old woman undressing would have
 been met with urges and pleas to just stop, but this was Mama Adele and
 I dared not.
 Steve on the other hand was trying to politely look away, without appearing
 positively horrified at the thought of seeing any sort of tits that had
 lost any meaningful function since before the moon landing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no other choice but to look away.

Steve me gave a startled look, and I saw his eyes filled with the gleam
 of mounting horrors, his face broken like a man who knows he's lost a battle

 Mama Adele was adamant in her belief and said so with a bang of her hand
 on the table, her voice craggy but fierce:

 Gay as a peacock.

I swallowed with some difficulty.
 The old woman certainly had been strongly opinionated in the past, having
 called me a `beelze-bob' and a `a peck of a cock' among other less colourful
 and not as endearing terms.
 But it looked like she had finally grown really old, and thus, really weird
 in many ways, to the point that some courts would probably even deem she
 had lost her marbles for good.
 `Just like Eileen,' I said in my mind and quite without expecting to, I
 picked up the jar of water and unloaded its contents on my head.
 `I'm not crazy!' she said inside my head, and I could feel her recede to
 a silent corner at the back of my head, as if she was suddenly holding
 a grudge against me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was looking at me as if I had just won a wet T-shirt contest.
 Perhaps he was trying to make some kind of signal the way his eyes seemed

I tried to kick him in the nuts to shut him up before he would say anything
 to deteriorate the already tenuous atmosphere or broach subjects that would

Mama Adele put down the chicken leg, and reached for the large table knife.
 I watched Steve slowly but deliberately inch his hand to the large fork
 still stuck on the chicken.
 Mama Adele said then with an unusual and rather haughty manner, in something
 that sounded very much like gibberish:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Au contraire, little spirit guide.

 And so much more than you're able to comprehend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and then I felt Eileen inside me come to the forefront of my mind
 and take control of every muscle, fiber and bone on my body.
 I think I shouted something like `the fuck you are, bitch' and then the
 next few moments turned into what could only be described as a pretty impressiv
e show of how old cutlery can be given new life by putting them to outstanding
 use as lethal weapons.
 Plus I was surprised to learn that my body could move like, well..
 Like a god-damn ninja.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama Adele lunged at me with the table knife, aiming for a good clear cut
 of my throat.
 But everything suddenly felt like we were underwater: her movements were
 slow and cumbersome, even for an eighty year old woman coming at me with
 a knife.
 She moved like she was surrounded by jello.
 And so did Steve, who had picked the fork up and was bringing it down with
 quite some force from what I could read in his ridiculously taut face,
 looking more and more like his real problem was a bad case of constipation.
 To make matters worse, the fork was still attached to the chicken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While my body moved in its own ways, in ways that Eileen was probably to
 thank for, I had all the time in the world to think about what had just
 happened, seeing as everything seemed to move barely a notch faster than
 a Jewish snail on a Sabbath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, Mama Adele had this little weird moment of speaking in tongues,
 along with Steve who maybe had the bigger picture here.
 Then Eileen's spirit took control of my body at what must've been a very
 fortuitous time, because I don't think I could have dodged that knife fast
 enough to maintain the ability to swallow without getting wet 
\shape italic
every single time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only did I dodge that knife, but I actually craned my neck backwards
 in a graceful move, with the knife missing me by no more than an inch,
 then thrusting the table away with my legs.
 Even as I fell, I saw my hands extending to touch the wall, leaving my
 body lying horizontally in mid-air, perched between the table and the wall.
 Mama Adele realised she had missed and was giving her knife another swing,
 only this time she was apparently - and this was a disturbing and painful
 thought - aiming for my balls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the corner of my eye I could see Steve finally realising the chicken
 was still hanging by that damnable fork, and he was duly making some very
 clumsy efforts at separating the two: he looked very miffed about it though,
 I'll give him that, and even as he swung the fork and the chicken above
 his head looking like a world-class hammer thrower, I could see he was
 quite frustrated but also determined to literally, pull it off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that sitting back and watching the fight unfold in front of my eyes
 like a cheap B-rated film, did nothing to hamper what Eileen was doing
 with my body.
 We were quite literally two people in one body, so while I craved for some
 pop-corn and soda to watch the action, Eileen was making the action happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It struck me as odd, that while there was this apparent struggle to the
 death between the three of us, I felt calm and relaxed, as if this was
 happening to someone else.
 From a logical standpoint, there was really nothing I could do, so watching
 and fretting about it wouldn't be of any help.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I just watched, as Mama Adele ripped my jeans open with her knife right
 at the seam of the crotch, missing the holiest of holies by a curly hair's
 breadth.
 No worries then I thought, and abruptly saw the room spin, watching the
 ceiling give its place to the floor and then come into view once again.
 Only this time my knee had connected violently with Mama Adele's face and
 I was surprised to find out there were so many cheap dentures still available
 in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I put my hands deftly on the floor, kicked out and away and hit her in the
 groin.
 Before she had time to even breath, I had managed to coil myself like a
 spring and then use the momentum to snap back upright, putting all the
 extra energy into a left-handed fist I swear could have knocked out a even
 a horny hippo on a rampage.
 Unfortunately though, she wasn't a horny rampaging hippo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know I felt her jaw crack and the force should have been enough to snap
 her neck.
 It was a killing blow, for sure.
 Whatever Eileen was doing with my body, and she was doing it extremely
 well, she didn't mean to just stop Mama Adele: she was trying to kill her
 outright.
 The problem was that Adele, or the gowa-na-di-tche as Steve had called
 her, wasn't on the same page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hook sent her reeling off the table, but somehow she used her hands
 like a fourteen year-old gymnast and turned her fall into a somersault
 that send her almost flying across the kitchen and a few feet away into
 the small living room where the TV was still on, showing a very familiar
 guy with wiry hair, smiling on a beach, wearing silly red shorts and surrounded
 by a plethora of large boobs that I wasn't able to simply discard as trivial
 under the circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was finally able to pull the fork free of the chicken.
 When he talked, I noticed that his mouth moved and I couldn't hear a thing.
 I half expected to hear everything slowed down and sounding bad-ass or
 perhaps like an amateur satanic ritual does, just like when your Walkman
 is running low on batteries.
 Instead, I heard myself as clear as day:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You had your chance, bitch.
 I'm gonna put a whole new meaning on elderly care,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to which Adele replied with a toothless grin, licking her lips with what
 I'd wish wasn't her real tongue:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mama's got a brand new bag o' tricks, bitch,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and then she came at us with super-elderly speed, knife in one hand and
 a very heavy-looking glass vase in the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't see what Steven was doing since I had focused on Adele.
 I stood there motionless as a stone pillar, and I saw in that same slowed
 down vision Adele coming closer and closer at an alarming pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A part of me wanted to duck, run, sprint away, make myself scarce, slide
 under the table and magically disappear faster than was possible, preferably
 at some point in the past.
 Another part of me wanted a sawed-off shotgun loaded with some double-aught
 buckshot, and an itchy trigger finger would be happily supplied by yours
 truly.
 I do not consider myself a violent person who believes armed confrontation
 is the best way to resolve a clash of interests, but seriously, the bitch
 tried to cut my throat and then my dick.
 She'd be so full of lead that the she'd become Radioactive's Man nemesis,
 at least until they next rebooted him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I did nothing of the sort.
 And Eileen seemed to be doing nothing at all, while I could clearly make
 out the reddish glow in Adele's eyes, as well as the blinding sheen of
 the knife in her hand which was certainly pointed the wrong way, and was
 certainly past the `I'm just fucking with you' range.
 Which was a troubling thing, considering that the large, heavy vase had
 been launched, and the smart money was that my face was the target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought that something had gone horribly wrong in a very small amount
 of time.
 Eileen's spirit seemed to have suddenly remembered that it had let some
 sort of spiritual stove on; duly and without warning she'd left everything
 hanging, without extending the slightest courtesy of returning control
 of my body to me, or at least killing the screaming bitch first and 
\shape italic
then
\shape default
 doing the spiritual equivalent of laundry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I saw her toothless, gaping maw grinning with the excitement of an easy,
 assured kill, I also felt my body swiveling to the right from the waist
 up.
 I arched my back slightly backwards and saw the vase in all its glory from
 a very prestigious point of view, flying right past my nose, spilling very
 tiny droplets of water in its path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only a foot away, Adele's hand was already half-way through its downward
 stabbing motion and the knife wasn't going to miss.
 She had actually jumped in the air with bent knees, adding her weight to
 the force of the stab and presenting a somewhat smaller target.
 It seemed unreal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, it looked real enough when I suddenly swooped under her arching arm
 with a superbly fluid motion and punched her straight in the nose with
 the back of my hand, while with my other arm I blocked her strike and gripped
 her arm in a vice.
 It was superbly executed and though I know nothing about martial arts,
 I instantly knew this would have looked great on a Jackie Chan film.
 There was though, a small mistake that complicated things at the last possible
 moment and gave Adele a fighting chance, and that was a plain and simple,
 pretty standard, knee-in-the-nuts move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, I was in pain, and even though Eileen was in control of my
 body, I could sure as hell feel it reaching every inch of my body, spreading
 like a wildfire from the groin outwards.
 Secondly, I had little time to reflect on why or how Eileen's spirit had
 proven to be so adept at unarmed combat, but I was pretty sure that it
 had been conditioned in a woman's body because the way I moved seemed to
 leave the precious stones quite vulnerable to someone with a cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I reflexively released Adele's arm from my grip with one hand, my
 other one reached for my nuts, a reflex that never served any purpose other
 than leaving one unable to block any kind of hit, unless using one's head
 as a blocking aid counted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I started to slowly but surely fall down on my knees in an ironically dangerous
 example of the saying `the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak'.
 I saw the sinister look on Adele's face and thought that it all felt suddenly
 very much like game over, with no credits left and all the pocket money
 gone, forever.
 I saw Adele's knife hand swooping down from a corner of my eye, going in
 for my throat once more, this time not to cut, but to stab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of her legs was about to meet my jawline and her free hand was just
 standing there, looking somewhat left out of the whole action.
 On a closer inspection, having nothing else to do while my body was unable
 to save us from a deadly stab and the many others like it that would probably
 ensue, I noticed her hand had gone slightly limb.
 And then I saw in great, shining detail a pitched fork squarely stuck between
 her forehead and an eye that seemed to be incredibly soft and squishy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other end of the fork was connected to Steve's hand, which in turn was
 thankfully still connected to the rest of Steve.
 I felt the pain numbing my senses, and the time flow normally once more.
 I was panting from the exertion feeling too weak to even attempt to get
 up, while Steve kept uttering the same kind of gibberish from before, the
 fork in his hand glowing with a bluish, white-hot intensity that seemed
 definitely wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adele was now frozen in place, her knife lying on the floor.
 Steve's veins were jutting out like someone had run a thick cable through
 them, and he was generally looking very fierce, pissed off and quite certain
 that Adele was a bad person, seeing how he kept trying to twist the fork
 deeper into her skull.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later, she threw her hands into the air and fell on her almost
 lifeless, arthritis-ridden knees.
 In her last moments, she spoke with a venomous quality that reminded me
 of snake bites and show-biz journalists:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ka-che-tne, ka-weka-te, boy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and crashed on the floor, appearing to be, for all intents and
 purposes, dead as a dodo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steven was panting as well, his face marked with the signs of incredible
 effort but immense relief as well.
 I tried using the table as something to use as a standing aid, and did
 so with moderate success, while the pain receded with each passing moment,
 turning into a numbing sensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was some silence while Steven pulled up a chair and just sat there,
 looking at the floor, his long hair in front of his face waving slightly
 by the wind of his breath.
 He reached for the inside of his jacket then, brought out his feathery
 hat, unfolded it and put it on his head all curled up, looking shoddy and
 wrecked, as if he had been carrying it in his pocket this whole time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at Adele's body with a degree of disdain that could only be comparable
 to that shown towards a pile of dog poo, and said with a gloating roar:

 on the floor, looking inappropriately gruesome with the fork sticking out
 of her forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does that even mean? For starters, what the fuck was that all about?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I said with just the right tone of indignation considering I had almost

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ask her,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Steve with a weary voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though thought is advertised as instant, it does take a little time to formulate
 in a thing as rudimentary as the human brain.
 In that time, Eileen had already spoken to me, saying the exact same thing.

Ask him.

I sighed.
 I sounded a bit confused, and understandably so I would believe, when I
 said with the slightest hint of ennui in my voice:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

She says, I should ask you.
 And you say, I should ask her? Is there possibly a way for you to sort

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My eyes caught the mess on the table, and I singled out the single salvageable
 thing: the chicken.
 My stomach made all the sounds usually associated with being starved, and
 then some.
 I sat down, dug in, and ripped a wing off the chicken.
 I immediately started munching away like someone set to enter into the
 Guinness World Book of Records as the human eating machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I heard Steve say:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

All right.
 You know, it's a bit complicated.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I sucked the soft bits of flesh still stuck around the bone joints and said
 after I swallowed and while I reached for the chicken's leg:

 Steve said looking thoughtful.

My stomach was churning like the Atlantic Sea, and I let out a small, rather
 polite little burp before replying:

I was sipping at some sludge that Steve had made insisting it was coffee,

 He made lousy coffee, but perfect Heimlich maneuvers.

\begin_layout Standard
We had been talking for the better part of an hour, old Mama Adele still
 lying on the floor since no-one had bothered to even move the body out
 of the way, not even for the sake of appearances and good taste.
 I'd learned that there was some solid reasoning behind that as well.
 Some of the things Steve had said though still didn't fit, so I asked more
 questions, expecting some kind of answers.
 I was surprised at how more often than not, the answers bring about more
 questions:

So who turned Eileen into a crazy person?

Mama Adele was the agent, that's for sure.
 But she was just an instrument.
 A tool.
 Someone else was behind that.

 behalf of someone else, for sure.

No, not really crazy.
 That was just her imprisonment spell.

 cared the most.

By Las Vegas standards, it's like half a lifetime.
 Yeah, I know what you're thinking, and this might sound like something
 a cheap son of a bitch would say, but hear me out.
 I was young, rash, and adventurous; I had just done this job at a small
 but profitable motel.
 I had gate crashed this wild party where anything seemed normal enough,
 and while I was drunk off my mind, mostly on the feeling of success of
 a job well done, I saw Eileen wearing a silly red hat, painted blue, and
 wearing a bikini made of less cloth than your standard handkerchief.
 I just felt I had to do papa-Smurf before I died, so I used my charm on
 her and before I knew it, I was wearing a ring, and singing the Smurfs

I'll tell you what happened, mani-chi-kwa, spirit guide of the Alabama.
 Bobby here, sweet ol' Bobby, took advantage of my weakened mental state,

I searched inside this man's mind and soul, and found out some shred of
 love for me was true.
 But his wickedness overcame his better human nature, and wealth blinded

 That was why he took off with whatever he could find in that safe, and
 why he has to repay me for this act of mine: Bobby Barhoe, I forgive you.
 I only feel loss and sorrow for the mother that bore this child you call

Surely aka-ne-wha-de, you have been wronged terribly and justice must be

The guardian's spirit saw the good in you, and the ritual I performed allowed

 But her true self lay dormant, and didn't wake up until she had to face
 the demon, the gowa-na-di-tche.
 That was when she realised who she really was, and what had happened to

 miserable to the point I'll likely just show up and let him put me to the

 So, I'm asking you? Are we good? Are we still on, like John said? Are we
 going to get to the damn parking lot, bring John back to do the job and
 get Falconi off my back, or have I almost died four times today just for

 send the spirit to the spirit-world, and now he can't come back unless
 he's summoned.

There's a very good explanation for that and it usually has to do with the

 And that's why, I couldn't think I had about fourteen hours to live.

The Country Cotton Candy fair did not involve any kind of cotton candy whatsoeve
r, despite its name.
 It mainly involved lots of people consuming large quantities of left-over
 soon-to-go-bad pork ribs, of whom most were drunk or definitely in the
 process of becoming so.
 As a bonus, most of them seemed to be relatives in all sorts of ways that
 were illegal in twenty-three states.
 On top of that, a significant percentage of the crowd seemed eager to perpetuat
e the tradition of keeping things in the family, and was eagerly working
 on making more relatives in situ; in public view, no less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were there because Eileen had made a couple of calls.
 I thought she would just swoosh about like some sort of tasteless ghost
 and frighten people out of their minds to get the info we needed, but it
 seems that in most cases just picking up the phone and lying your ass off
 to certain people with a straight face can work miracles.
 Some people actually believed we were calling on behalf of the Elvis' Secret
 Moon Base Society, and a few of them could actually remember having attended
 one of our balls.
 On the moon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, all that bullshit on the phone paid off and we learned that Novorski
 was sponsoring the fair - a highly prestigious event considering the amount
 of vomit already visible - and had been scheduled to appear right about
 midnight, say a couple of words to the gathered crowd and then probably
 go back to counting cotton balls in his well-guarded warehouse complex,
 complete with electric fences, a minefield, and a piranha-filled moat,
 with trained alligators for guards, riding sharks armed with lasers and
 rocket jets.
 That last bit of information could not be easily confirmed and was a bit
 doubtful, seeing as it came from a member of the local press, the same
 one who had insisted that he had attended an Elvis' Secret Moon Base Society
 ball; on the moon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fire at the mansion hadn't been on the news, and his private secretary
 hadn't said anything about canceling the appearance, though she had sounded
 very interested hearing about the Midget Awareness program going on in
 St.
 Cuthbert's and the annual Ms.
 Crucifix pageant.
 It seemed then that plan B was our best choice.
 Any plan followed by the letter `B', usually is preceded by a plan A.
 Which is to say, the fair wasn't part of the original plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd popped the obvious idea that maybe Eileen being his daughter and all
 could just waltz up his office, ring the bell, get inside, say `Hi Dad'
 and stab him repeatedly with something sharp until he bled to death.
 But that wouldn't work because now she'd awakened, she was giving away
 a spirit aura that anyone properly attuned could see just by looking at
 her.
 Even though it sounded a lot like `I've got this awful headache', and `I
 can't do this lying down', she was pretty convincing when she tuned her
 aura to the visible spectrum as well, and I was surprised to know that
 the human eye could actually see all those colours without causing a man
 to go blind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that idea being impractical, Eileen had come up with a novel approach
 to the problem, based around a simple, easy to follow strategy that had
 proven extremely popular in the past, with the foremost memorable example
 being the Charge of the Light Brigade: Just barge in his warehouse office,
 kill him, and burn him with some gasoline or any other flammable material,
 except perhaps bourbon.
 It's useful to remember that even though the Light Brigade went down in
 history as a self-sacrificing act by men of heroic courage, sadly none
 of the men involved were available for a comment afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being a professional thief, one of the job requirements is being able to
 examine the many minutiae that comprise a plan and make an assessment of
 the plan's viability and chance of success, based mainly on experience
 and preferably dependable, current information, as well as taking into
 consideration the chance of acceptable losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having taken all that into account, and after prolonged and thoughtful deliberat
ion, the idea of barging in Novorski's office could only be compared to
 a village of natives in the Amazon waking up one day, and deciding they
 were the rightful rulers of the entire world, before promptly setting out
 to conquer everyone else armed with sticks, spears, stones, and the occasional
 sharp tropical fruit, arguing amongst themselves that the one hiccup in
 their plan was whether or not their canoes would be able to provide the
 required logistics support, mainly mangoes and coke leaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, it was beyond silly.
 It was suicidal.
 So, we'd gone with plan B, which was to kill Novorski - who was in fact
 a demon, I had to keep reminding myself - right there, at the fair.
 The where and how remained to be seen.
 Probably once he had made his little speech.
 Maybe in some thick bush, while he was taking a pee, or inadvertently while
 stargazing.
 We'd have to wing it, and my spider-sense tingled erratically whenever
 I had to wing things, which had been a lot in the past few hours.
 So plan B didn't account so much for a plan and ergo wasn't that much better
 than plan A, but it did not involve sharks, piranhas, trained alligators,
 lasers, machine gun fire and assaulting what was in effect, a small fortress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What it did involve though was somehow getting close enough to Novorski
 to lure him someplace quiet away from the crowd, doing what had to be done
 and then burning the host without people getting in the way and asking
 questions like `why are you trying to stab that nice man?', or hearing
 the announcer say `oh golly, someone's shot Mr.
 Novorski in the head! What a show folks, eh? Now, y'all have some of those
 ribs'.
 As the saying goes, discretion is the better part of valor.
 Since my idea of valor was staying in the shadows and creeping silently
 behind the enemy before I jumped at him while he was taking a dump, that
 also meant I was a big fan of discretion as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was hot, damp, and dusk had just fallen.
 The fair was taking place at this large old barge station right by the
 riverside, where the smell of cotton seed oil mingled with whatever happened
 to be floating in the river, and the resulting odor was less than agreeable.
 We were wading through the milling crowds, doing light reconnaissance work,
 identifying the stage where Novorski would appear, and all the while being
 careful not to attract unwanted attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That translated into avoiding the usual hotspots in the gathered crowd,
 namely blind drinking contests (named so because the winner usually ends
 up with optic nerve damage), prostitutes (sex workers is a more catchy
 term, but in Memphis they still call them whores), and alligator fights
 (popular opinion is that the losing 'gator is turned into women's accessories,
 but some local news outlets circulated some rather more sinister rumors
 about zombie assasin 'gators).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shorts were the practical attire of choice for women; I had one more reason
 to stay transfixed on Eileen's behinds as she waded through the crowd,
 surveying the place and filling in the gaps in the details of our little
 plan.
 She turned around suddenly once more and knew I had been focusing my attention
 on her butt once again.
 I smiled reflexively without bothering to think this was the new Eileen,
 and promptly enough I was in a position to try and remember the constellations
 of the northern hemisphere.

 I heard someone say, and then I realised that it was Steve who was unfortunatel

 It seemed like when he said `I gotta go pee', he had actually meant `I
 need to go get drunk as a skunk and then go pee', which was perfectly reasonabl
e taking into account that he had a drinking problem (those kinds of people
 are still called alcoholics, even in Memphis).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one needed proof of that, all one had to do was take a look at him and
 notice the shiny, embalmed, and thus quite dead skunk he was holding in
 one hand, the obscenely shaped carrot dangling in front of his nose tied
 with a red T-string around his head, and last but not least the fact that
 he had been carrying a ten-gallon beer can strapped on his back, with a
 regulator valve hanging over his shoulder, wearing nothing other than rubber
 boots and some boxer shorts sporting the American bald eagle, front and

The many ways in which the sentence didn't make sense threatened to bog
 my brain down in a quest for the unattainable; the knowledge of how people
 as weird as the duckbill platypus have survived to this day.
 Thankfully though, Eileen just pulled me and Steve through the crowd, and
 said in a hushed voice:

Midnight was approaching fast.
 Eileen had gone to great lengths to explain her idea fully, but somehow
 I still had my reservations.
 I always did when things approached the hour of truth, and this wasn't
 that different.
 It actually was far more important than any job, heist, robbery or con
 I had pulled off before.
 She had made it perfectly clear that Novorski, the demon, was to be killed
 and burned, but not before she had a chance to ask a few very important
 questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we didn't get what we wanted out of Novorski, she had made it perfectly
 clear that no amounts of spirit shards would open a doorway to the after-world.
 And that was something that curiously enough had to do with me, not Steve,
 and definitely not her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't sure if she wasn't just playing me to her own ends, but then again
 I thought Steve had been a fed, which would have meant the FBI's standards
 were stooping too low, even for the likes of them.
 Giving her the benefit of the doubt and having no real alternative, I grudgingl
y accepted the fact that I had to trust her.
 And hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could have said that things were ticking along with military precision
 if it wasn't for Steve who was roaming the stands making lewd gestures,
 not being able to hold his water like a grown-up should, making faces and
 obscene gestures at passers-by, and generally blending in seamlessly with
 the rest of the fair-going crowd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kept my eyes continuously on him, and part of my job involved keeping
 tags on him.
 For the most part though, Eileen had entrusted me with a role that made
 good use of my existing set of skills; primarily lying, stealing, and running
 with the intention of not getting caught under no circumstances whatsoever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the better part of about two hours, I had been plying my trade like
 a pro.
 First, I tried picking some wallets, but most were devoid of cash, filled
 with pennies, plastic money, the occasional condom, and the usual NRA member's
 card.
 I tried to lift some cash off the various stands, but all I got was some
 Mexican pesos, some one-dollar bills cut in half, and monopoly money, which
 seemed to be legal tender in the crowd but wouldn't be of any use in the
 real world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had it been any other day, I would have called it quits, and gone home to
 a glass of wine and watch the film at eleven that hopefully didn't involve
 alien sex or Sigourney Weaver.
 But I had to make it count that night, so I went above and beyond: I raided
 the money pot of the `Save the Memphis Armadillo Fund'.
 The actual money pot happened to be shaped like a huge armadillo and placed
 smack in the middle of the whole fair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I rarely happen to talk about myself and how great a thief I am, but
 any professional in the business would admit it was a damn hard job to
 pull.
 And they'd also call me `an audacious son of a bitch' or in case their
 vocabulary didn't include the word `audacious', which is more often than
 not the case, `a cheeky bastard'.
 And that would be the right thing to say, because I did it in plain sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a basic technique among social engineers (who in Memphis were still
 known as con artists), but one that was rarely applicable to the sort of
 jobs that paid off handsomely.
 When the opportunity or the need for some quick cash arose though, and
 the situation allowed for it, robbing people in front of their eyes and
 acting as if it was perfectly alright to do so worked amazingly well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All I had to do was grab myself a Cotton Candy Fair T-shirt stamped with
 the catchy motto `Now y'all have some ribs' and tape a couple of pieces
 of paper on my front and back that read `STAFF', and presto, I was a bona
 fide fair staff member.
 All I had to then was walk up to the huge armadillo, lift its bottoms,
 reach into its innards and grab the plastic box brimming with some real
 cash, all the while smiling, nodding and waving encouragingly to everyone
 who happened to venture a look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then walked away, and counted the paper money without a care.
 It took some time but there was a hefty sum involved which proved adequate
 enough for what Eileen had in mind; and that was making a large, charitable
 donation to the fair, with the stipulation that the donor had to have a
 private talk with Mr.
 Novorski, 
\shape italic
in person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that person would be me.
 Because, naturally, I'm the go-to guy when dealing with demons, evil spirits
 from the after-world, and all sorts of supernatural stuff that's really
 bad for one's personal hygiene, since dead bodies go to rot pretty quick
 and the smell's, well, rotten.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I had a quick chat with a cheerful old lady who seemed to be the Country
 Cotton Candy Club's cashier, secretary, president and sole member.
 When I showed her the money, she had a second or two with herself before
 shaking my hand as if her life depended on it and assuring me that Mr.
 Novorski and I could have all the night to ourselves for twenty five thousand
 dollars, which she wasn't loathe to admit was almost as much as the annual
 `Save the Armadillo' fund raised each year, more or less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It kind of felt like buying the sexual services of a business entrepreneur
 who had become a male prostitute purely as part of an ongoing market research
 in an effort to diversify his approach to potential customers, which in
 fact probably meant that he had a very sick hobby and not much in the way
 of scruples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It also felt like whatever money people donated each year, the armadillo
 would still be in need of saving, long past after the sun went supernova,
 and perhaps even after the heat-death of the universe itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having set the trap, my end of the job was done.
 All that remained was Novorski's arrival, and then we'd be game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was participating in a belching contest and though I couldn't hear
 from that distance, the applause and cheers when his turn came were indicative
 of his chance at winning.
 Eileen was also watching, albeit from a different angle.
 She shot me a weary glance; I shrugged knowingly and smiled.
 She shook her head and grinned, and I noticed Steve had just stage-dived,
 still holding his embalmed skunk way up high, as if it were some sort of
 tomahawk, an electric guitar, or a combination of both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we heard an announcement from the PA in that familiar, aggravating,
 friendly-sounding voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now y'all put those ribs down, and keep off the hooch jus' a lil' while,
 cause the managers and directors of the Country Cotton Candy fair are proud
 to welcome our very own benefactor, well-known and loved for his many contribut
ions to the community, especially the ribs, Mr.
 Jeremiah Novorski.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing much happened, and the usual round of applause and perhaps cheers
 did not ensue.
 No-one really seemed to have even acknowledged the announcement, even less
 so the fact that Novorski had just appeared onto the center stage, prominently
 featuring right behind the huge, and by now mostly empty, armadillo.
 The announcer felt he had to make a suggestion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now y'all better clap those hands for Mr.
 Novorski, or the skinny-dippin' party's canceled.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instantly, as if a light bulb had gone off above each person's head, the
 crowd responded with a hefty amount of applause, and a loud cheer.
 Novorski appeared to smile politely, but very thinly.
 I'm no expert on demons, spirits, and the like, but I'm pretty sure these
 sort of events weren't in his job prescription originally, and he loathed
 every minute of it, especially since it appeared like he was supposed to
 play the role of some good Samaritan, bringing joy through ribs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen was standing with her back against a weeping willow, pretty much
 hidden by all the low-stooped branches.
 I could see her features plainly taut with determined fury and a clear
 purpose in mind.
 It was one more reason why I was very relieved to not have her inside my
 mind.
 There was something about the way she clenched and opened her fists continuousl
y that made me believe that just a glimpse of her mind right at that time
 would have felt like a floating balloon does in a shitstorm of monumental
 proportions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve seemed to be completely unaware of his surroundings, quite drunk and
 judging from the very rude body language about to exchange his laminated
 feathery hat for some sexual favours from what appeared to be a small group
 of height-challenged people (I believe in Memphis they're still called
 midgets).
 Now, I don't consider myself one of those judgmental pricks but the value
 for money on that deal seemed horrible, only I couldn't tell which of the
 involved parties was taking advantage of the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as I was concerned, Steve was probably having the time of his life,
 while everything important in my life, mostly the ability to keep breathing,
 hang by a thread.
 One could even say I envied him for being so care-free, seeing as the midgets
 put on his hat and rubbed his belly with cotton seed oil, but that would
 be a very wrong assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Novorski's voice through the PA caught my attention, while most of the crowd
 kept on about their usual frolicking and lollygagging, and the midgets
 along with Steve were no exception either.
 I heard him say in a squeaky voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good evening to y'all; I'm certainly going to enjoy it.
 I hope everything's going along smoothly, 'cause you know, smooth is fun.
 Up to a point though, right? I also hope that Mrs.
 Robinson here, our organizer, has done everything in her power to keep
 things running along, like she does every, single, year..
 Now, usually you'd hear me say a few things about how important it is to
 remember to support the local cotton industry, which is to say keep buying
 everything related to cotton, and especially that worthless cotton seed
 oil that's only good for gettin' your hands dirty and your rifle clean.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
That sounded a bit strange, bad-mouthing his own product.
 It unfortunately made more sense though when he continued after he briefly
 pausing to rearrange his belt:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But this time, it's a different year all together, so I'd like to take this
 opportunity to set some things straight.
 First of all, I'm sick of you people.
 Don't worry, I'm not talking about Memphis.
 I'm talking about people, in general.
 I hate that pestering ability of yours to have hope, even when everything's
 going to hell faster than a fast-freight train.
 Which brings me to the next issue: and that is that I'm not who I seem
 to be at all.
 It was about god-damn time things got going, but you won't really mind
 about that, I've seen to it.
 Y'all had ribs, right? Last but not least, Eileen, or whatever your real
 name is, you're in for a shitload of pain, honey.
 'Cause you've been a naughty girl and daddy's really pissed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those last few words in the wrong context could have been interpreted in
 a slightly perverted way, but when taken at face value they kinda got me
 thinking that plans A and B were both painfully inadequate to deal with
 Novorski, who seemed aware we were going to be there from the start.
 Instead of bidding his time, he just literally sprouted wings, grew horns
 and a set of sharp fangs, a barbed tail, as well as an array of the assorted
 nasty features usually associated with demons, beelzebubs, balrogs and
 the armies of hell as portrayed in popular religious fiction.
 He had turned into a physical form of the demon he really was, and I wasn't
 sure we could just burn him now, much less kill him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a bit of a laugh actually, realising that all those quaint depictions
 of evil demons were actually true, but it wasn't as funny when that demon
 stood twelve feet tall, with an impossibly inhuman but overly developed
 physique, the stink of rotten eggs and stale blood emanating from him reaching
 hundreds of feet away, and a very real, shiny, and quite sharp-looking
 set of serrated bone claws of the sort that made visceral death a most
 literal notion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen did not shy away though and stood her ground, looking at the demon
 with a piercing set of glittering eyes.
 That meant she wasn't about to start running which would have been my primary,
 secondary, and tertiary choice (and all subsequent choices, rest assured).
 She seemed to be grinning, like letting everyone know she was ready to
 put up a fight right then and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That didn't resonate all too well with me, especially seeing that Novorski
 had turned into a demonic creature weighing probably half a ton, and the
 ability to kill a man with a mere slap in the back.
 Not to mention its breath, which was in urgent need of some mentos (or
 any other fresh-maker, take your pick, I'm not splitting hairs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to help, sure, but I wasn't pretty sure about what I could actually
 do against something profoundly irrational and monstrous like Novorski,
 other than bleed profusely in the off chance that it might slip on my own
 pool of blood, fall on its back, and provide a mildly comedic intermission
 to the real fighting.
 Because there was bound to be a fight, and there would be blood.
 It felt like Mama Adele all over again, the difference being this time
 I felt we were slightly mismatched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially since the crowds kept looking at the demon positively bedazzled,
 mostly pointing at him without realising what it was they were seeing and
 quite possibly thinking this was some sort of special event organized by
 the Memphis Association of Special Effects, which sadly in fact consisted
 of a twelve-year old boy with a penchant for vampire flicks and half a
 pint of raspberry syrup in his mom's fridge which happened to look a bit
 like fake blood, if one looked at it from the right angle, and under the
 right light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No-one started to run, scream and shout, or alternatively fall on their
 knees, pray in despair for deliverance or grovel and offer virgins as sacrifice
, both practices being equally probable in succeeding.
 In fact, I think that the `Married my cousin' and `Marty the Memphis Midget
 is a Mean Mother-you-know-the-rest' events were still going on unabated,
 judging by the sheer number of beer cans thrown at Novorski-in-demon-form
 from their respective spots, protesting for Novorski ruining the party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve did more than just bat an eye-lid when he saw the demon.
 He instantly dropped the beer can he had strapped on his back, threw away
 the dick-shaped carrot and T-string, and rushed over to me, skunk still
 in hand, while Novorski erupted into an evil uproar of demonic proportions
 that frankly sounded like someone facing severe stomach trouble.
 I was idly watching the crowd silently - and almost on cue - part in half
 and create a wide path, as Novorski jumped off stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marty the Midget could be heard, shouting on his own `Think ya tough? Huh?
 I'm the Memphis Mean Motherfucker, motherfucker!', followed by shocked
 gasps from the majority of church-goers who had attended the show in an
 effort to fight profanity and evil in all its forms but were somehow still
 undaunted - even indifferent - to the demonic monstrosity that fumed sulfur
 and sported ember hot eyes that seemed able to peel one's skin by their
 mere gaze.
 Perhaps it was because the demon wasn't wearing the customary informative
 T-shirt based on a tune, like `Am I evil? Yes I Am', `This is the Road
 to Hell', or `Hell ain't a bad place to be'.
 Perhaps it was just the fact that these people seemed to act like mind-wiped
 idiots.
 Eileen then shouted something that caught my attention:

 stand, fell on all fours and started doing something on the ground that
 seemed similar to a drawing.
 His movements and disposition were clear, precise, purposeful.
 He somehow seemed not just to be suddenly sober, but pumped up.
 I couldn't help asking:

 he said, hurriedly scribbling all sorts of gibberish and weird geometric
 shapes that frankly looked a lot like something I was fairly certain he
 had ripped off from Rosemary's Baby.
 I thought this was a really bad time for being so nostalgic about a film
 by Polanski.
 Eileen interrupted my train of thought with a regal shout, her feet barely
 touching the ground as she levitated towards Novorski at a slow, deliberate
 pace:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
I would have protested that these folks had very little in the way of brains,
 ergo minds to poison in the first place, but that thought somehow became
 something quite irrelevant when I realised Eileen had tasked Steve with
 protecting

his

 life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That did in fact sound somewhat prestigious and it certainly made me look
 like a really important person like all those famous folks who can't take
 a leak without someone watching over them in case something bad happens
 to them, say like a pot plant falling on their heads from a high balcony,
 or a group of bullets with the intention of using said famous folks as
 handy inertial dampeners (in Memphis they call that `stopping a bullet').
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That meant Eileen thought I was some kind of target.
 And that made me highly uncomfortable, and as was usually the case that
 sort of thing tended to kick off my run-and-hide instincts, perhaps the
 single most useful of the traits passed on from our early hunter-gatherer
 ancestors (that and the tendency to proliferate sexually - which in Memphis
 was still called porkin').

 I said with the slightest hint of hope to Steve, who had just finished
 a rough sort of circle on the ground; I noticed we were standing right
 in the center of it.
 Steve looked at me and replied in a very strange way which I didn't expect
 or liked at all because it involved

 Do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded my understanding in a perfectly clear fashion that made my neck
 hurt, and was determined to follow Steve's advice.
 Even if every inch of my body wanted to start running on its own, in various
 mutually exclusively directions, at record-breaking speeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My fear was only strengthened when I saw Novorski purposefully stride towards
 Eileen, who was silently slightly bobbing up and down in mid-air, radiating
 a bluish neon light from her skin, as if she'd just come back from a really
 hardcore rave party where shooting paint 
\shape italic

 instead of just dabbing it on the skin was the norm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd was cheering and yelling boos at the same time, in anticipation
 of what they perceived to be some sort of UFC match-up the likes of which
 they had never even thought possible, not very much unlike what a real
 fight between Mothma and Godzilla would've looked like to a Japanese crowd:
 Unreal, yet so cool you couldn't resist touching it even if it meant losing
 a finger to frostbite.
 They were stupefied, fatally attracted, and grossly mislead altogether:
 they threw ripe tomatoes at Eileen who seemed to be putting a lot of effort
 into resisting the urge to adopt a more vengeful attitude towards the bystander
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Novorski on the other hand had already tramped on a couple of folks unlucky
 enough to ask for his autograph.
 He was casually whipping his tail around as if it were some kind of pet
 making others suffer from its own ADHD, and making gestures suggesting
 lewd activities that seemed to involve his bifurcated tongue and his -
 thankfully - asexual pelvis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As some sort of invisible clock ticked away and everyone seemed to be attuned
 to the dispositions of its hands, I saw Steve had closed his eyes and was
 repeating the same thing, over and over:

\begin_layout Standard
That kind of self-assurance led me to believe that Steve might have been
 the wrong person to assure my safety from this demon or any other threat
 that involved something more dangerous than a cake fight.
 My attention was drawn to what sounded like badly-greased chainsaws throttling
 away at a junk yard:

 grunted the demon, who grinned with all the malevolence usually associated
 with his kind, showing off a couple of tusks that shone sharp like razors.
 Eileen's response was immaculately well-thought out, original and appropriate
 for a spirit of her stature:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said with a calmness that belied her strength, raised a hand, and out
 of the clear night sky without a cloud in sight I saw lightning strike
 at the feet of the demon, with a blinding flash of light.
 The sound of cracking air followed by the deep rumbling echo of mountains
 crashing into the sea made me think the world was coming apart at the seams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an astonishing show of sheer power and command over nature; an unparallel
ed tour-de-force that made Eileen look like a heathen goddess of yore, powerful
 and unforgiving, smiting folks all day long for no apparent reason and
 them worshipping her for it as well.
 Too bad it didn't actually do anything to Novorski, who appeared to be
 left unscathed.
 The smile on his grotesque, demonic face had a gleaming quality about it,
 which implied he was enjoying this immensely.
 His voice was sticky, like tar:

 he said and with the flair of a world-class sprinter jumping the gun he
 flung himself towards Eileen with just one flap of his wings and a giant
 leap; his arms were outstretched, ready to clench her in a swoop of his
 claws that would leave little to be imagined about what guardian spirit
 hosts looked like on the inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His ferocity was abundantly evident; his supernatural physique left no doubt
 about the extend of his strength, speed, and agility.
 He was a demonic machine, bred for bloodletting, destruction and chaos,
 indeed designed to wreak havoc on human flesh.
 But there's always flaws in a design, and that fact was remarkably pointed
 out when Eileen arched her back all the way, hands touching the ground,
 exactly the moment the demons' claws swept at nothing but air, and then
 sidestepped him by rolling to the side, avoiding his kicking legs and tail
 with a motion so graceful and regally syncopated, it reminded me of a cross
 between Grace Kelly and Tito Puente.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the demon flew past Eileen without being able to hide his aggravation
 and surprise, he managed to bring himself to a stop after a few yards,
 and I made the mental note that somehow these things were limited by physical
 laws as much men as the rest of us.
 Which was probably a good thing, as long as they were somehow persuaded
 to fall from tall cliffs and onto jarred, sharp rocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve still hadn't opened his eyes, but he had at least stopped reminding
 me that the circle around us with all the cursive writing and the weird
 sex symbols was just a circle and nothing more, and the only thing that
 stood between us and that thing was Eileen.
 He did ask though:

 I asked in vain but did not bother to wait for an answer or to press the
 matter further.
 What was going on in the background, behind the approaching throng of Memphis
 zombie demon thralls, as far as I could tell, was pure mayhem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though I didn't have a clear view, I could see fireballs the size of a car
 shooting up in the night sky.
 Some of them where actually real flaming cars, but that was just a pedantic
 difference.
 I also saw lots of lightning, sheets of hail and spikes of ice, flying
 blocks of stone, as well as giant swirls of water raised from the river
 and hurled at Novorski.
 They were swooping, and tilting and turning in the air, with Novorski trying
 to get his claws on Eileen while she kept pounding at him with everything
 nature could provide.
 Except fire, which seemed the demon's natural element, seeing as he writhed
 in red hot and yellow-white flames of purgatory.

Steve tugged at my jeans at a really inappropriate place, and I thought
 that being gay and perhaps about to die was in no way a valid reason to
 try and fondle my private parts.
 I saw that he was just reaching for me blindly, keeping his eyes shut,
 but mysteriously saying nothing:

 he said and acting on his earlier advice, namely to do as he said, I closed
 my eyes and listened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And all I could hear was shuffling summer flip-flops across the Memphis
 soggy riverside ground, interminably coming closer and closer.
 The zombies' feet were meandering at the edge of the circle, with hands
 outstretched, quite possibly hungering for brains or other vital parts.
 In a rare fit of actually thinking about how things could be any worse,
 I imagined that maybe there existed such a thing as a gay zombie.
 I didn't dare think about that further.
 I simply said to Steve with a wavering voice:

No Steve, these aren't invisible ninjas.

 of touching something that wore flip-flops as if they were real shoes.

 giggle as if it tickled.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can hear Eileen's lightning bolts and mini sheet storms, I can hear Novorski's
 fireballs explode among the trees.
 I can even hear Marty the Midget still going on about how he once knocked
 up two twins while sleeping with only one of them.
 What else do you want me to hear?

The 'choppers man, the 'choppers..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Steve said, and I heard the faint but characteristic sound of music spreading
 upstream the river, wading in the night sky.
 I couldn't hear any choppers, but after a moment or two, above the snarling
 throaty sounds of the mindless Memphis denizens that encircled us, I could
 hear the unmistakable sound of Wagner's Die Valkyrie, and I suddenly smiled
 and thought that all this must simply be a very elaborate film set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kind of dismissed that idea when the corn started falling from the sky,
 while horns and other brass instruments blared in epic fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thick pellets of corn started shooting out of the sky in wide jets, as if
 someone was throwing it at us through large hoses.
 I instantly caught a whiff of garlic, and saw the gathered zombies unable
 to resist themselves, and opening up their mouths to gulp down as much
 of it as they could, like a water-starved man does when it finally rains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the background I could see the demon looking surprised, even apprehensive,
 trying to fly away from Eileen instead of trying to cut her into little
 pieces like earlier.
 It was as if he was thinking what was happening was bad for him, and he
 was trying to escape.
 I couldn't make a possible connection, until one of the zombies grabbed
 me by the shoulder and asked me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey ol' buddy? Mind if get that ladle back? Kinda need it to stir the stew,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I replied, completely flabbergasted while Steve started yelling right in
 my ear:

It's them! Woo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who the fuck's them anyway and why is corn falling out of the sky? And for
 fuck's sake, why Wagner?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, feeling quite irate and definitely believing that some kind of
 explanation, however illogical or impossible was in order.
 And as the crowd of former zombies dispersed pretty much in the same way
 as it had been formed, returning to whatever they had been doing before
 they were turned into hopefully unwilling minions, I watched as Eileen
 was nowhere to be seen, and Novorski had vanished as well, leaving nothing
 but flaming debris and the occasional cinder of a tree, which weren't that
 unusual for a Memphis riverside fair on a summer night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My question wasn't left unanswered for too long, since I suddenly saw the
 demon form of Novorski being shot through with a couple of harpoon-like
 sharp things, from which a run of cables seemed to disappear into the night.
 Not a moment later, the harpoons and the cables flashed electric blue and
 seemed to sizzle hotter than a melting pot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like I had noticed earlier, demons seemed unable to escape the laws of physics,
 so this one was dropping down fast.
 The Wagner music was no more when I heard a splash and then the usual hubbub
 of the crowd which as always, seemed happily oblivious to absolutely everything
 that had happened, apart from the fact that Marty the Midget had peed his
 pants, for no apparent reason, and from what I could hear that stirred
 up some pretty heated debates on whether or not that was legal in the state
 of Tennessee.
 Still, there was no sign of Eileen, and that was kind of unsettling.
 After all, I was only almost knee-deep in corn because I needed her to
 help me save my ass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve suddenly cried and pointed to the sky right above us, while I felt
 the gentle rush of a downwind ruffle my hair:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Them, man! The Bureau!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Feds? But how? I mean..
 I'm a dead man,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said mostly to myself, believing that pretty soon I'd be in custody for
 felonies committed in fifty-one states (counting the job in Puerto Rico).
 Once processed and in a federal prison, my life would end abruptly at the
 hands of one of Falconi's men.
 There was no point in running from people who could turn zombies back into
 regular people by shooting corn at them.
 Then Steve managed to make me slightly more likely to punch him for mixing
 thing up:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not the feds, man! The Bureau! Look!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sounded positively thrilled about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The downwind grew into a real gale, and the stands around us fell over,
 and some were even carried away, while the few folks who had been sitting
 behind them, just kept on pretending everything was in place, while I could
 now feel hot air trying to strip most of my facial features off my face.
 I could barely open my eyes but I could still see Steve had done a hell
 of a job with his teeth, as a constant turbulent flow of hot air was shot
 on his wide grinning face, his teeth clenched as if glued together and
 the skin around the mouth fluttering away as if someone was trying to slice
 jello with a jackhammer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I saw it with my own eyes, and while still unable to explain most of
 it, the idea that this was actually an elaborate movie set popped back
 into my mind as the hull of a large blimp became visible as it had just
 touched the ground, with what resembled a quad of tilting engines coming
 to rest in an upright position.
 It looked a lot like the Goodyear blimp, only beefed up, painted jet black,
 and giving off an aura of being indestructible, even though the damn thing
 would probably fall right off the sky if a bird with a really pointy beak
 decided it had issues with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was looking relieved, calm, and beaming with enthusiasm.
 He reminded me of someone who has just had great sex with some twins, followed
 by a Cuban cigar, a glass of Hennessy, and couldn't wait for the Baywatch
 rerun to start on TV.
 Then the blimp's cupola door swung open and I saw this tall black fellow
 pop out, dressed in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, wearing a pair
 of black glasses coming my way, hands easily visible, his posture cool,
 and calm, business-like and natural.
 I was about to ask what the hell this was all about and who the hell these
 people were, when I saw Steve smile like this was a Kodak moment of pure
 gold.
 Then I heard him say just a few dozen feet away from that black-suited
 guy, pointing at him with a cheesy-looking hand in the shape of a gun,
 grin as wide as the Panama canal:

\begin_layout Standard
The black man in the suit stopped abruptly, and didn't look particularly
 happy, and definitely not as happy as Steve.
 In fact he looked like he had been offended somehow, kind of like someone
 had called his mother an ugly unscrupulous sex worker.
 He shot Steve a look that said `don't go there', while he actually said:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I saw the white of his eyes bristle, as if it somehow shone with his furious
 anger.
 I think I cleared my throat before deciding to speak, which was the perfectly
 wrong thing to do at that exact point:

\begin_layout Standard
Steve saw the man he had called Jules smiled and seemed to mellow a bit,
 and took the opportunity to try and set things straight, perhaps making
 some sense out of all this in the process:

 he roared suddenly, pointing the hefty-looking silver-finished Magnum at
 Steve, who subsequently went silent at once and seemed content to just
 listen.
 The man in the suit then seemed to relax a bit.
 He smiled at me, took my limp hand and shook it saying:

\begin_layout Standard
Within moments, we were ushered first inside the blimp.
 It didn't look much different than a trailer to be honest, and there were
 these other guys also in black-suits who motioned us to sit down in two
 - comfy I'll admit - chairs.
 They wore the most expressionless faces I had ever seen, and I half expected
 them to start doing those pre-flight emergency presentations, wearing life-jack
ets and showing us how to use an oxygen mask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they just sat there like immovable objects, parts of the decoration,
 rigid and stone-like.
 Until Jules got on-board and saw them one of them erupt in stomach killing
 laughter of the kind one cannot voluntarily stop, and soon the other guy
 followed suit.
 Jules just looked at them disapprovingly, shook his head and said:

And you got a bet on it as well? Who's going to crack first or some shit?

 The standard fifty,

 Jules seemed to like-minded when he said, tapping that guy's chest:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can make life so difficult for you in the Bureau, you'd be wishing you'd
 pursued a career as bait for schools of piranhas in the Amazon, or perhaps

 Did I make myself clear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Yes, sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the not-so-funny-now-looking guy said and proceeded through a door to what
 must've been the cockpit, while the other guy had finally managed to contain
 his laughter and closed the door.
 Within moments, we were lifting off the ground, and Jules asked me, while
 eye-balling Steve in a threatening way that perhaps involved non-consensual
 sex:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Can I get you anything? Some refreshment, a

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to say I was fine, when after finally having sat down and being
 able to just let someone else do something for a change, I heard my stomach
 rumble violently, and realised I hadn't eaten anything since that morning,
 and that didn't even count as a real breakfast humans eat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there were are other pressing matters my mind should've been
 occupied with, like `Who were these guys? Was Steve working with them?
 Why? Where was Eileen? Where they telling me the truth? Was this some kind
 of trap? What did they want of me? What's with the black glasses at night?'.
 But it completely disregarded those and filed them under `interesting but
 not pressing', and instead concerned on getting something to eat.
 So I said to Jules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there something like a ham and cheese sandwich?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 question:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Mayo, mustard or ketchup?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I settled for some mayo, and when Jules disappeared to some sort of small
 kitchen, Steve said in a low whisper with an excitement that prompted me
 to check whether or not he had peed his pants:
\end_layout

Man, you really have no idea what an honor that is!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I did in fact have no knowledge of the honor involved, I was perfectly
 satisfied with enjoying the sandwich itself when Jules returned with it.
 Happily gobbling it down, I ventured a fleeting look outside a small window
 pane, and I was amazed, just as I had been promised: we were flying so
 fast I could see the lights on the ground below zip past like this was
 just another freeway, eating away at distance like it was peanuts.
 I was interrupted by Jules who pulled a chair from a little utilitarian
 table, sat across me and said:

What Jules told me on those few minutes, made no sense at all.
 I had questions, lots of them, and he promised that people of a much higher
 authority than himself could fill me in with the details.
 All I'd gathered was that there was a war going on.
 Not on communists, drugs, or terror, but a war with the forces of evil
 at large.
 I think I just shrugged, thinking that I didn't really care about that
 sort of thing as long as it didn't involve me; after all, there's wars
 going on all over the world all the time.
 Unfortunately, this specific war somehow did involve me, and perhaps not
 as surprisingly, Eileen as well.

 For just the slightest moment, I thought he was referring to the sandwich,
 but that was just my stomach thinking for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I learned Steve had been working for these guys, the Normal Bureau, as an
 undercover agent taking part in what they called Operation Beetroot.
 He was positively psyched sitting face-to-face with Jules Caesar, who apparentl
y was some sort of legend in the Bureau.
 I don't know if that was indeed the case, and what kinds of feats had earned
 him that sort of recognition, but the look on Steve's face meant he was
 willing to do anything to get on Jules good books.
 And I do mean,

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow all that new information failed to materialise into something useful;
 for instance, could these guys with all their invisible supersonic helicopters

 I'd even write them a postcard from the after-world if they somehow helped
 me get in, and then back out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I suggested just that, all I'd gotten was two sets of awkward looks,
 with Jules adding with some hesitation

 Maybe it wasn't exactly something on their list of top priorities, since
 they seemed preoccupied with a lot of weird demonic shit, but it was number
 one in mine.
 And I had this very distinct impression that `briefed' actually meant `jerked

 he said, prompting Steve to jump up from his seat like a coil unwinding.
 He then opened a cabinet of sorts, revealing a large number of what appeared
 to be very silly hats, the kind the Pope wears.
 Steve put one on his head, and gave me one as well.
 I honestly felt we were going to some sort of Halloween party, or maybe
 one of those extravagant dinner parties held by eccentric rich folks.
 Jules insisted:

 tone in his voice.
 The intercom chirped once more, but this time it was the pilot:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came back the terse, almost frightened reply.
 He then turned the door handle and let the door slide open.
 With a quick hand signal, Steve was the first one off.
 He quickly glanced left and right, as if in some sort of confusion, and
 gave a thumbs up.
 Jules then nodded to me, and I got off as well.
 A warm summer breeze greeted me, and I felt my feet bury themselves in
 something soft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic smell of manure became instantly prominent.
 Which was to be expected since we had landed on what looked like a cow
 farm, the fresh cow dung I had just stepped on being a dead giveaway.
 The blimp's engines went full throttle a few moments, and it disappeared
 into the night sky like an imaginary whale, leaving nothing but a faint
 haze and an imperceptible rustling noise behind it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jules urged me to move and I duly complied; he kept right behind me, while
 Steve lead the way, heading for what appeared to be a nondescript barn.
 The moon was full, and its light cast a silvery sheen over everything,
 except perhaps cow dung.
 A few yards away from the large, half-open barn door, the unmistakable
 length of a hunting rifle appeared, while the rough edges of a figure that
 still remained in the shadows could be roughly traced.
 Steve froze in his tracks and pointed hesitantly at his silly papal hat.
 The figure took a step forward, revealing himself to be a squat, short,
 fat old little fellow wearing a farmer's overall and a pair of boots twice
 his normal size.
 He shouted then with a voice that sounded like weasels making out in the
 woods:

\begin_layout Standard
The sudden and violent exchange of insults started and ended right there,
 when the old man uncocked his rifle and stood at attention, before saluting
 Jules, who didn't as much as even look his way.
 Steve ushered us inside the barn, and before long we were walking in complete
 darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I heard a knock followed by a dull thump, and then I heard Steve say in
 poorly concealed agony:

 Jules said and I heard a clicking noise that soon turned into a whir.
 Before I knew it, the ground below us was moving, and we were smoothly
 riding down a shaft on some kind of a platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warm spotlights around the edges of the platform lit up then, while soft
 hall music started playing.
 Jules started humming along, and Steve couldn't resist the urge to do so
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You think you're a funny guy Johnson?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Jules said, giving off the aura that a positive answer would have been
 the wrong answer.
 Steve stopped, lowered his head and kept looking at his feet like a scolded
 schoolboy, while I was fascinated by the amount of gems hidden away in
 the various layers of ground, making a mental note to myself to invest
 heavily in Topeka real estate, provided of course that I'd put all this
 nasty business behind me soon and live as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a minute or so had passed, and while certainly the illusion of riding
 a perfectly normal elevator kept my mind adequately numb, I couldn't help
 asking Jules:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A polite little `pong' was heard and we came to a very soft stop in front
 of a dull, plain looking steel door.
 Jules cleared his throat and said in a very loud and clear fashion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's a niggah gotta do to get some respect around here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which promptly, as if actually responding to his voice, the door opened
 and revealed an immense well-lit space, with large balconies the size of
 plazas extruding from the rock, rigid superstructures extending from the
 ceiling downwards to scary depths, and uncannily curvy gangways crisscrossing
 like a metal knot.
 It was perhaps unsurprisingly filled with people wearing the same stupid-lookin
g hats as we were, milling about on foot, Segways, bicycles and even skates.
 It somehow reminded me of LAX on a bishop's annual convention, only this
 complex appeared to be a lot bigger.
 Jules stepped off the platform and showed the way, while Steve said with
 a proud smile, walking right behind me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked in a joking manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I realised Steve didn't answer `no, of course not, don't be silly,
 he's not a Nazi or anything like that'.
 He just gave me a wary look and kept his mouth shut.
 And then I started feeling nervous again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
* * *
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rabbit's Nest certainly looked impressive, even though it was in effect
 nothing more then a really deep and monstrously wide underground well.
 There were actually buildings sitting atop those balconies, as well as
 blast-proof doors scattered around the rock walls, large and small.
 There were all sorts of weird-looking people giving me the eye for no obvious
 reason, perhaps apart from the fact that I had this very miserable looking
 face on, feeling groggy, famished, and probably unable to resist the urge
 to use the bathroom pretty soon as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I didn't bother returning those looks, even though I felt I had every right
 to do so because of the silly hat, which Steve had so many times bothered
 to correct me on every occasion was called a mitre, and kept reminding
 me I should definitely not refer to it as a silly hat especially in front
 of Von Papen whom I was supposed to meet shortly.
 Something about the whole affair told me it wasn't exactly a social visit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name struck me as German; I was corrected once more to learn that he
 was half Austrian and half German, which further confused me.
 I couldn't help asking more odd little things that struck me as weird while
 we kept hopping from balcony to balcony, in a downward spiral ever deeper
 into the Nest's innards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve filled me in as best as he could, but even he had no clear idea why
 there weren't any god-damn elevators around this place or why the place
 had an excessive number of waste baskets that were provocatively empty
 all the time.
 He did know thought that the floor tiles were a mishmash of colours and
 types, a genuine mosaic indeed, not because of some flair of artistic design,
 but because they used dirt-cheap left overs from discounts and sales as
 a cost-cutting measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jules had kept silent for the entire time, curiously choosing not to participate
 in my impromptu orientation.
 I'd noticed he kept an eye on the both of us, and an especially keen ear
 on what Steve said, who seemed to think a lot about what he could and couldn't
 say, choosing his words carefully.
 That didn't strike me at all as a very friendly work atmosphere.
 Not only that, but I hadn't seen nor heard of Eileen.
 When I asked about her Jules gave me a hesitant answer, that she was transferre
d to a different location for her own safety, but his words had this hollow
 sound to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I consider myself a very capable liar, and as such I'm pretty adept
 at separating the wheat from the chaff; I know when a person is lying out
 flat, when he's just telling a small lie, and when he's lying like a man
 in congress does.
 Jules was talking exactly like that; he wasn't exactly lying technically,
 but he wasn't telling me everything.
 What I found somewhat comforting though, was that he acted and talked like
 he wanted me to know he wasn't telling me everything.
 And that only helped to tie my brain in a knot, not as large as the proverbial
 Gordian one, but still definitely a pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The further deep down we went, the fewer the people moving about.
 I could barely see the actual bottom of the well, but I thought I could
 glimpse a faint shimmer from below, and at the very center of it, some
 sort of huge, bulbous shape.
 I asked Steve then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What you don't understand is that this is just a sort of front HQ.
 Forty eight hours ago, it was sealed tight and quite empty of life, except
 of course for Von Papen and his personal team.
 There's probably a good reason there's no elevator.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Steve, shooting a couple of wary glances at Jules, who finally broke
 his silence and added:
\end_layout

Mr.
 Von Papen is the regional commander.
 Operation Beetroot falls under his jurisdiction, and the Rabbit's Nest

And so we did, and within a couple of minutes we had finally reached the
 bottom, where the lake stood.
 We crossed a rusty, creaky gantry over to what could barely be called a
 small island but in essence was a rather flat piece of rock right above
 the surface of what I hoped was just plain water.
 Occupying the island was, without any exaggeration, a sort of giant blue-white
 Faberge egg, etched with faint but intricate decorations that from some
 angles looked like detailed, precise geometric designs and from some other
 angles like perfectly innocent depictions of Easter bunnies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was easily three stories high and as wide as a moon rocket, curiously
 lit by some sort of inner light, as if it was painted with glow paint.
 There was this rather large, crude metal door at its base that looked quite
 out of place, as if someone had put it there as an afterthought, rather
 by design.
 Jules led the way and stood in front of the door.
 He knocked once, paused, then knocked again three times, the hollow metal
 banging echoing weakly, while the sound of ripples in the water around
 us made me want to pee urgently, prompting me to ask Jules:
\end_layout

 I said and started off to take a piss in the lake.
 Then I heard the rueful sound of a gun cocking, and as instinct would have
 it I froze in place.
 Jules sounded impossibly as every bit as polite as a nun on St.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said while slowly turning around and showing my hands which were nowhere
 near my zipper.
 I saw Steve standing there with an open mouth, apparently even more surprised
 than I was.
 He looked as if trying to say something like `no', or `fuck', but that
 would probably forever remain a mystery.
 A slit on the door opened, and a set of eyes appeared, sporting a troubled
 gaze right under eyebrows so large there could have been a whole lice ecosystem
 in there, hitherto unknown to man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eyes wavered some and then I saw with mounting wariness that they were
 fixated on me.
 The next moment, they seemed to smile, a loud clang was heard and the door
 opened.
 From inside poured some soft candlelight, and while I waited for Jules
 to step in and lead the way, he instead showed me in and said in awed overtones
:

I thought that all those words sounded awfully like something someone would
 say to a soldier about to rush straight on heavy machine gun fire through

And then I heard the door close behind me with a hollowed-out sound, while
 my field of vision was filled entirely with a stunning vista of rows upon
 rows of insanely tall bookcases, well-lit by blindingly opulent chandeliers,
 their tiny pin-pricks of light magnified by their numbers to a warm summer

It was without doubt the most magnanimous thing I'd ever seen, and even

Then I saw the man - or rather someone who might have resembled a man somewhat
 - to whom the huge eyebrows had belonged to: his back was monstrously deformed
 with a bulbous shape the size of a basketball, and his face looked like
 whole generations of plastic surgeons had used it for practice.
 Nevertheless, he was smartly dressed in some sort of brown uniform that
 sported some weird polished metal insignia like cherubs, skulls, crosses

 Which was almost unsettling if one were to think that thieves were becoming
 respectable members of society, but then again politicians had always usurped
 our rightful spot by pretending to be entirely different.
 Nevertheless that odd remark made me feel like someone famous, which was
 in and of itself, a uniquely new experience.

 the voice said and Bartholomew complied, swinging the large wooden doors

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We walked inside an incredibly opulent study, decorated with all shades
 of gold, wood, and granite, with rich evocative tapestries strewn around
 as well as hanging from the tall walls, amidst various detailed paintings.
 There was a pervasive scent of cigar in the air, and the room was dominated
 by a huge sort of display on one side, and of course, the only other man
 in the room, who I was right to presume, was Von Papen himself.
 He was dressed in a plain red uniform, with matching black and red breeches,
 wearing a single but very distinctive button on his collar.
 He rose from his chair and I saw him squint through his monocle, before
 grinning and saying to me, sounding exactly like a bad actor trying to
 do a German accent:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no, thank you.
 I'm full,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said and declined politely, because indeed I had eaten as much as a starving
 bull.
 I hadn't quite expected this sort of reception, especially with what I'd
 been told up to that point about the Baron.
 Had I based my expectations solely on the merit of what I'd been led to
 believe, brutal torture would have been the order of the day, instead of
 a lavish, gourmet banquet that seemed impossibly exceptional by any standards.
 It was indeed far better than the usual all-you-can-eat buffet, and definitely
 a lot more satisfying than Jules' sandwich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bartholomew had laid out everything on a solid, definitely antique wooden
 table with experienced precision and unusual alacrity and grace, not to
 be expected from someone looking so ungainly.
 Not only that, but it appeared he'd actually cooked everything.
 While my initial reaction upon learning that would have been to search
 my plate for signs of hair, fallen teeth, and worse, I found the idea childish,
 since it all tasted, and looked, perfectly fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt full, and content, I'd left all my cares behind, postponed every
 thought and notion of the why and how, and had instead focused on pure
 enjoyment of the simple things in life: roast phageant with sour berry
 and cream sauce, a deliciously refreshing sauerkraut, a variety of grilled
 sausages and lots of other things I couldn't be bothered asking about and
 rather concentrated on eating.
 I'd even taken a piss, in what must've been an exact replica of the bathroom
 of the Queen of England.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was bliss.
 The Baron even gave me the luxury, of engaging in nothing more than small-talk
 about nothing important in particular, like the Colts', the federal budget,
 or the Republican convention.
 Unfortunately, the generally unavoidable rule of thumb in the universe
 was well in effect in the Baron's study as well, and bliss could only have
 lasted for so long:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I won't say no to that, Baron,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied and followed him to the fireplace, a delicately crafted marble-lined
 fireplace, already aflame, the wood inside creaking and cracking as it
 burned, beautifully.
 I sat on a very warm and comfortable chair, sporting ivory inlaid arms
 and green velvet cushions.
 It felt like enjoying the afterglow of sex, without any sex.
 And even as my gaze wandered around the room for a bit, I felt for a moment
 like I was doing intel work for a job.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially when I saw the high-tech display at the far side of the room
 that looked rather like a map of sorts.
 Lights and icons blinked on and off, moving, vanishing and appearing as
 if stuff was happening all the time.
 The way the display seemed to be made out of thin-air, reminded me of Star
 Wars holograms, and stupefyingly rich folks with a tendency to spent it
 on perfectly useless gadgets such as this one.
 The Baron offered me a glass of rich, full-bodied brandy that didn't require
 a connoisseurâs experience to tell it was the best stuff on Earth.
 He sat opposite me, cupped his own glass in his hands, drank a mouthful,
 tasted it thoroughly, swallowed and said:

And then he grinned at me, and what I saw behind that grin was a friendly-lookin

 become the wiliest son of a bitch with the flip of a switch.
 It would have felt very reassuring at that time had I known for certain
 that we were on the same side.
 Judging from what I saw on the display next though, it seemed like for
 some reason or the other, we were like best buddies.
 But I could've sworn, on pain of anything other than death or excruciating
 torture involving genitalia, that I had never laid eyes on that man, or

Yet here I was, seeing myself in photos, playing cards with the Baron and
 the Pope, looking seriously drunk alongside a very healthy, yet still fat,
 gray-haired Elvis, and naturally it would seem, having birthday cake with
 the Queen of England.
 And that was just the people I could recognise: because there were hundreds
 of photos that I was in, wearing fatigues, those silly hats, examining
 crates of weird-looking stuff, some in exotic locations, others in what
 appeared to be laboratory facilities.
 There were even photos of me jumping off a plane holding something looked
 like a blob of pus-ridden flesh with stumped tentacles, skiing in the alps
 carrying a really strange sort of gun and shooting at faint blueish things,
 that looked eerily familiar like ghosts.
 To top things off, I saw a photo of me in an astronaut's suit, mock-humping
 another astronaut, on the moon, with a vast building complex in the background
 and a couple of things looking astonishingly similar to UFOs right above
 our hands.
 I just couldn't believe all that, and even though I was about to start

 Repeatedly.
 Until the magazine ran out and I was laying sprawled on the floor.

\begin_layout Standard
The after-midnight dinner with the Baron had made me groggy.
 Jules seemed very eager to make me some coffee, so I happily obliged him.
 The way the coffee he made carried over some of his most distinctive features
 was uncanny; he made some mean, black, coffee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had been briefed in super fast ways on what the current tactical situation
 was: Eileen was holed up around the gateway on the after-worldâs end.
 Demons and literally all hells kind of things kept coming at her and a
 few hand-picked men, wave after wave, time after time.
 More and more personnel was stacked on this end of the gateway as well,
 fighting off Falconi and his own mob, a mix of a few summoned demons, wild
 monsters, and unscrupulous men.
 They were trying to get to Eileen and the gateway by the backdoor, and
 open it for the hordes waiting on the other side.
 It was looking bad, and the only bright side about the situation was that
 I was immortal.
 Which, after making sure that there was no catch, like cutting my head
 off or melting me in hot metal, was pretty cool, and would definitely prove
 a life-saver; at least for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the middle of the night, and I was an avid believer that the faster
 things got done, the faster everything would be back to normal.
 Of course, in the Normal Bureau, normal had many meanings, none of which
 could be found in the vocabulary.
 Nevertheless, I found it strange that I could've probably walked away right
 then and there, but I didn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could have walked away, and Falconi couldn't - as Jules would have put
 it - `pop caps in my ass'.
 I could have walked away and all these people with their silly hats, all
 they could have done was go all wild-eyed and insist that I thought about
 it once more, and then perhaps cry alone or en masse for the coming Revelation,
 Armageddon, Rapture, or whatever they wanted to call the huge bitch-slapping
 that was about to hit home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then, I thought, where would that leave me? How could I have lived with
 my immortal self for aeons afterward, in a barren, molten, putrefied sulfur-rid
den landscape, with not another human around, and everyone's soul back in
 the pits of Hell, building more tar pits, and mountains made of bone, rivers
 of blood and bile, and the occasional but seemingly necessary, pit full
 of shit to bathe in.
 I'd just hate the place, and there even wouldn't be anyone or anything
 to steal from.
 I'd probably end up asking demons for favors of the worse kind, and that
 somehow seemed like a bad idea from the very start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'd decided I'd go in, use my mind, heart and soul, preferably only figurativ
ely speaking, and destroy the gateway I'd once build myself once and for
 all, so then the Normal Bureau could go back to policing the odd cult,
 the couple of occultists that actually got the incantations right, and
 the occasional stranded demon that had forgotten to dial home.
 At least that's what Jules told me they used to deal with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were scared, actually.
 The people in that briefing room, with their mitres on and their black
 suits carried hollowed looks.
 It was plain in their eyes that they thought their chances, our chances
 slim.
 Maybe that was because they understood what we were up against.
 I, on the other hand, only had a faint idea, and was totally oblivious
 to what they perceived as a horrific, end-of-days situation.
 Frankly, I thought they were overreacting, and that things weren't all
 that bad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I noticed Jules was looking at me intently.
 Under the harsh, bright white light in the situation room at first I thought
 he was just squinting, but then I noticed everyone was looking at me like
 they badly needed some prescription glasses.
 Jules made a hand gesture that I should go on.
 I had been woolgathering, and I couldn't remember what I was talking about
 at all, so I asked no one in particular:

 papal mitres shuddering like that was so hilarious I'd thought I'd burst

 I contained myself barely, and asked them to take those things off:

I couldn't believe myself when I said it, but it somehow felt like it was

 I sighed before asking, feeling embarrassed to even consider such a thing:

\begin_layout Standard
A sinister-looking red light dominated the large cabin space of the assault
 team's helicopter.
 What was left of the Normal Bureau's combatants fitted inside two helicopters
 in all.
 I was riding alongside Jules and his own hand-picked team.
 Everyone looked slightly ridiculous in the football jersey's, especially
 the women in the team who found the chest plates extremely discomforting
 and most had decided to just leave them behind.
 If it hadn't been for the constant chopping noise of the rotor blades and
 the grim visage on everyone's faces, the cabin could've been just the setting
 for an expensive porn film.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we banked left and right, crisscrossing in the air along with the other
 extremely modified blackhawk (which as far as I could tell consisted of
 a relic bible attached to its nose, leather-bound and hand-written by a
 catholic Saint), it looked almost as if a couple of playful night-birds
 courting in the sweet, warm summer night.
 In fact, there was nothing sweet about the night, and as we approached
 the Gateway station, I felt my stomach turn.
 It could've been the uneasy flying, it could have been something I ate.
 For the most part, I didn't want to think it was the shakes, the kind of
 fear that sometimes took over right before a job.
 Or so my false memories told me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was fear of failing.
 Like when you're trying to pull that Jenga block without ruining everything,
 or when you're about to flip that omelette in the frying pan, only in a
 larger scale.
 I'd taken things up to that point in my stride, just adapting, reacting,
 and trying to see the silver lining.
 I still didn't feel sure about why I just hadn't given everyone the one-fingere
d salute (or in some foreign countries, the two-fingered salute - I'm sure
 a man like Baron Hasso-Ludwig Freiherr von Papen would have gotten the
 idea right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it was the whole absurdity of everything.
 A part of me thought that this was just too bad to be true, and I just
 had to believe that it was a very big practical joke, or some kind of huge,
 honest misunderstanding.
 Another part of me was definitely awed by the newly discovered fact that
 I couldn't die.
 It felt empowering to the point of just wanting to do crazy stuff for fun,
 like jumping off a plane without a parachute, going lava-boating, shooting
 yourself from a howitzer, or visiting an Asian country and trying the local
 cuisine.
 Of all the above, I was trying my luck against the hordes of Hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as I saw the men and women around me who were probably thinking they
 might not make it out of this one alive, and that they had made quite possibly
 the worst career choice in human history, the thought of Eileen just popped
 into my head out of nowhere, exactly like when you can't remember that
 guy's name and it flashes in your mind when you're taking a shit.
 Was I doing all this, just for Eileen?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean, I remembered liking her, and I certainly remembered her anger and
 passion as a guardian spirit, and the looks she gave me, but it was very
 far fetched to believe that was going literally through hell for a woman.
 Not that it wasn't a pretty common phenomenon in the everyday lives of
 most men, but that was just a metaphor.
 I just couldn't think it was possible, but it felt right, even if that
 was the only reason I was about to get knee-deep in demon ichor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, I had nothing to lose, apart from the rest of the world that
 made it such an interesting place to live in.
 I'd get through this alive and that was guaranteed, but there was no guaranteed
 I'd really want to in the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was resting my hand-picked finely sawed-off shotgun on my lap, feeling
 its comforting weight.
 It was interesting to note that it had the words `et ibit in inferno erant'
 carved on its stock.
 Jules had told me that it roughly meant `go to hell and stay there'.
 I found it quite fitting and picked that one among a multitude of relics,
 including - but not limited to - the spear of Longinus, Mjolnir, and other
 similar stuff I thought belonged to a museum or perhaps a comic book.
 Seriously, a hammer?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I traced my hand across the shotgun's stock, and felt the engraved letters,
 the pilot was heard through the intercom:

 I heard the man say, and I couldn't understand anything other than that
 something would happen in three minutes.
 Jules made a hand signal like a circle and everyone around the cabin started
 checking their stuff.
 I tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention and had to shout to make
 myself heard over the noise and vibrations:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll see, sir.
 A-Team, sound off!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jules said and one by one everyone in the cabin shouted out name, uniform
 number, and readiness.
 I thought the uniform numbers would come in handy; I didn't know any of
 them by their names so I could just call them by their numbers.
 And that was probably the extend of help the football gear would provide.
 I hoped we might get lucky, but then again I tried to think claws like
 Novorski's against their flesh.
 I asked myself what was wrong with me, but I had to at least tell them
 to feel better for myself.
 I cupped my hands and had to shout to be heard:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't get killed! Okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of them couldn't hear me through their helmets, and shook their heads.
 I gave it another shot:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, sir.
 No pie!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one of the women shouted back, and I just gave her a thumbs up, sighed
 and fell silent.
 I heard the pilot through the intercom once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thirty seconds to flare, rope in and hang tight!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone passed their ropes through their carabiners and double-checked
 their harnesses, while the helicopter started lurching every way possible
 violently.
 I thought the pilot'd lost control and we were about to crash, while I
 saw a bunch of flares go off and light up everything with intense light.
 The other chopper in the pair did pretty much the same, but as I saw its
 flares pop away, this huge hand suddenly grabbed its underbelly, and it
 abruptly disappeared out of my field of view.
 Jules screamed at the men:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Safeties off! Go empty on that thing's ass!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the two men handling each minigun on the side just started shooting,
 trying to hit whatever kind of demon had grabbed the helicopter out of
 the sky.
 I only saw it once more, as the pilot wrestled to gain altitude or shake
 that demon off, even while our guys filled the sky with tracer fire, and
 the folks on the other chopper tried to get off some shots at that thing.
 Then our own helicopter suddenly pitched up as if a giant pair of reins
 were suddenly trying to stop us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it started to hover above the ground, I could see the gateway's building,
 a nondescript museum-like construct, a wide staircase leading up to a metal
 door, inscribed with all sorts of weird shapes and alphabets.
 Behind that, huge wells from the abandoned copper mine were dug in the
 earth, almost dried up, like huge shot glasses waiting to be filled.
 There was mayhem all around us, all kinds of hellish creatures fighting
 with the Bureau's men and women; some of the fiends and monsters were carrying
 guns, some wielded rocket launchers, and others were cradling sharp dangerous
 things like scythes, swords and axes.
 Mostly axes.
 Jules screamed like a maniac:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go! Go! Go!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and everyone jumped off the chopper, cradling their rope lines with one
 hand, their weapon in the other one.
 I hadn't realised it, but I was already tumbling down, and Jules was grabbing
 me from my belt.
 As I felt the softened impact on the sandy ground, I saw our chopper swiftly
 break off and try to gain height; I also saw the other helicopter that
 had been struggling with that demon finally succumb to gravity and clumsily
 fall sideways onto the gateway's building, its screeching sound drawing
 the attention of everyone for the slightest moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We all saw some of the men jump only moments before the chopper became lost
 in a cloud of concrete and smoke.
 The demon that had brought it down lay slumped on the ground, and even
 as I heard Jules rally the team and focus at hooking up with our people
 inside, I could feel my chest and ears thumping from the ferocious vibrations
 of wild gun-fire.
 Everyone seemed to have opened fire; I saw everything as though strobe
 lights were flashing all around me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had I been an epileptic, I'm sure I'd have a seizure.
 Instead, there was this buzzing inside my head, and a terrible feeling
 of sudden under-pressure, as something like a bazooka round flew right
 beside my head.
 As I turned around, trying to see what had caused the sudden panic from
 trained professionals who supposedly let rip small, controlled bursts,
 preserving ammo and making each shot count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally when things don't happen in their usual fashion, there's probably
 some kind of extraordinary reason, that more often than not calls for extraordi
nary measures.
 I was looking at a twenty-foot tall extraordinary reason, with all the
 charm and guile of a pair of outhouses, with four arms as thick as a man's
 torso, armed with bony blades larger than a broadsword and judging from
 their shiny sheen, sharper than a scalpel.
 The panicked response of just starting to shoot on full auto was, if not
 anything else, quite understandable even though rather underwhelming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I saw the demon lurch forward, ready to cut half a dozen men in tiny slices.
 Jules right beside me had gone apeshit gun-crazy, and having emptied his
 empty Magnum .44 he dumped it on the ground and drew a really keen blade
 out of a sheath on his back, charging at the demon like a really confused
 Superbowl samurai fan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demon saw him, and grinned.
 Shying away everything the others threw at him, he turned to face Jules
 head on, with the most probable outcome being Jules turning into a cut-away
 cardboard version of his old self, while the rest of looked in sympathy
 and complete helplessness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought it couldn't hurt to actually use the damn thing, so I just pointed
 the shotgun towards the advancing demon, and with the smell of it's sulphur-lad
en fumes right at my nostrils, I shouted at him, trying not to look at the
 stock:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Et..
 xzibit in inferno errand!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The demon paused in his lethal stride, and even Jules stood with both hands
 holding his sword above his head, right before he was ready to deliver
 a blow.
 I must've done something wrong and something right at the same time when
 I tried to say it right:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Et, ibit infernum in..
 Just go back to hell already!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I screamed and felt the kick of the double-barreled sawed-off shotgun.
 As I realised I wasn't quite prepared for it, feeling my nuts squeezed
 beyond their usual design capacity, I reeled from the pain, and through
 blurry vision I saw the demon take every single buckshot to the face, little
 writhing blue flames of holiness eating him up from the inside, even as
 the rest of the guys opened up fire once more, with Jules timing his blow
 perfectly, aiming right for the head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the demon roared in quite probably excruciating pain for the last time,
 it fell on its back with its hoofed feet wildly flailing in the air.
 I think I saw a few smiles, but there was little time for high-fives, since
 our surprise arrival had attracted the very loving attention of more of
 Hell's minions, but not very surprisingly from my point of view all I could
 think of was that I could now never have children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a quick glance I saw various imps, lesser demons, and a couple or more
 of flying demons had broken off their siege of the Gateway building, and
 were headed our way.
 Jules offered his hand so I could get up.
 I grabbed it and even though my balls felt like lead weight I got up and
 saw a line of men had formed up on our flank, and they were already opening
 fire against the devilish things coming our way without any care in the
 world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jules was taking opportunity shots with Magnum and at the same time shouted
 at me, even as I was reloading my own shotgun:

I prided myself in knowing pretty much nothing about fighting, except from
 when to run like hell.
 And exactly because of that, I knew this wasn't the time for running, or
 taking care not to get shot.

 Jules said and looked like he was ready to take them all on himself.
 I took a look at the entrance to the gateway, a few dozen yards away, the
 bodies of demons and imps strewn all around, a ragged bunch of guys in
 black suits double-tapping their pistols and rifles, some already up close
 and personal with wolf-like creatures.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he replied and emptied a clip on a flying demon, ripping its wings apart
 and putting a volley of bullets right on its head, which burst in flames,
 right before the demon crashed on the ground, ichor oozing out of every
 bullet hole.
 That was a pretty solid demonstration that in fact he could, so I calmly
 started walking towards the building's entrance, repeating to myself that
 I was immortal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curiously enough, no one bothered to have a go at a figure that didn't seem
 at all preoccupied with the ongoing firefight, so I reached the defenders
 totally unscathed with my football jersey in perfect condition, taking
 a couple of shots at a few imps that thought that perhaps I was worth biting
 their teeth into.
 A woman called out to me, her hair ruffled up but still wearing her sunglasses.
 She was kneeling down behind a badly chipped marble column, in what must've
 been the epitome of keeping one's cool:

\begin_layout Standard
Someone knocked rhythmically on the door, and in a moment it opened from
 the inside.
 There was this Bureau man with a suit that simply nodded knowingly, and
 without further ado, went outside, holding a machete and an Uzi.
 I closed the door behind me, turned all the locks and put its bar into
 place with some effort.
 The muffled sounds of the fighting outside could still reach me, but otherwise,
 I was completely alone inside the gateway's building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surrounded by luxury that itched to be carried away to a getaway car, I
 followed the main hallway towards a faint, blue shimmering light.
 Past an archway with all sorts of apocryphal inscriptions carved in a gold
 plaque, I reached a small circular pool, no more than a few yards across.
 I couldn't see any sort of cables, pipes, lasers or the stuff usually associate
d with weird machinery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It felt like water-lilies should be floating inside, and little frogs leaping
 around, catching insects.
 Hadn't it been for the fighting outside and the ticking clock, I could
 have just fallen asleep right next to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sole source of light inside that small and otherwise quite plain and
 empty chamber was this small pool.
 Small waves flitted across its surface, which was more like a mirror in
 turmoil, silvery and without depth, very much unlike water.
 No sound came out of it, just this intense, blueish light and I knew then
 this was the `intrinsic field reality horizon' Jules had told me I had
 to go through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He should've told me to just take a dip in the pond.
 I took a deep breath and held it before I jumped inside, shotgun at the
 ready.
 For a moment all I could think of was not to shoot the first thing that
 I saw on the other side.
 Then everything seemed to disconnect from my mind, from my feet upwards,
 as if I was very carefully and gradually being sliced.
 I then saw blinding flashing spots in my eyes, right before complete darkness
 took me.

\begin_layout Standard
The briefings and the charts, the various stuff they had shown me could
 not have relayed the fact that going through the damnable gateway was like
 filling your stomach with bricks and sand and then violently vomiting everythin
g through your nose.
 My head felt like it had already been donated to science and then returned
 as it hadn't been found useful at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked around and saw I was in the same chamber, only the pond, the gateway,
 was curiously enough placed on the ceiling.
 Everything else seemed exactly the same.
 I picked up my shotgun and checked my ammo.
 I also checked the `device'.
 It was still strapped on my back, tight and snug as a baby on a back pouch.
 On the outside, the `device', looked just like a stick pony toy.
 The difference being the stick was made of an intricate, super-light alloy,
 and the head, the pony bit, was like an enlarged, stylized chess piece
 horse-head made of some kind of crystal, among other more exotic materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no one around the chamber.
 I half-expected it to be crawling with demons, with Bureau men fighting
 at close quarters.
 Like, face-to-face close.
 Or at least someone guarding the gateway.
 But there was just me in there.
 I could hear faint sounds from the outside, but it didn't sound like the
 firefight I'd just left behind, but rather more like a murmur, or kids
 whining.
 As I was about to make my way out, and find Eileen, I saw a blueish, translucen
t form very similar to what John had looked like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Age-old human instincts and reflexes trained from a fake memory of a lifetime
 of running from the cops would have made me take a few steps back before
 running away from a ghost, something universally considered scary, abnormal,
 and potentially hazardous for sanity.
 Instead, I just lay there looking almost apathetic as I saw the unmistakable
 form of Eileen pass through the walls.
 She looked pissed, and quite incorporeal.

 she shouted and grabbed me by the wrist.
 Interestingly enough, she actually pulled me through the wall, and while
 I saw very tiny amounts of matter flash through my eyes in just a split
 second, I hadn't realised she could do that, so I was still looking like
 I had wet myself when I came over to the other side.
 Immortal or now, meeting a brick wall from that close was something I hadn't
 gotten used to, and did not intend to anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A pungent, sick smell with the distinct aroma of sulphur attacked my senses.
 While I grimaced at the almost insufferable smell, I turned my head around
 and saw.
 And then hopelessness grew inside me like beer foam.
 Just a glimpse, and that made me want to just have a smoke and some idle
 talk before just lying down and letting everything around me go up in flames.
 It made me think that perhaps that plaque outside the gateway room actually
 meant `abandon hope all ye who enter here'.
 Because it was a certainly fitting thing to say about that place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Legions, not hordes or multitudes, but innumerable armies were amassing
 in front of us, marching slowly but surely in perfectly ordered rows, their
 flaming scimitars swaying with each step.
 Great swarms of flying demons circled overhead, monstrously giant things
 that seemed like locusts made of bone, their cries echoing the agony they
 could inflict.
 It was like watching Dante's Inferno remade into an epic action movie,
 which spelled disaster in so many ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sky wasn't the black night sky I'd left behind, but a sickly orange
 red that belonged to some alien atmosphere or the aftermath of a nuclear
 holocaust.
 It seemed both were a reasonable fate if we failed here.
 Which was a most possible scenario, even if I applied some very creative
 math alongside certain imaginary power multipliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could see the men and women of the Normal bureau standing their ground.
 There weren't more than a few hundred at most, nothing but a drop compared
 to the ocean tide that was about to consume us.
 Most of them were already engaged in close fighting with what looked like
 the shock troops of hell, the same kind of demon that I'd killed with my
 shotgun just a few minutes earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once every few moments an intense bright white beam would shoot from something
 that looked like the ghost version of a unicorn on steroids, and incinerate
 a few of the brutish demons in one go.
 Large balls flaring with white and blue starlight would shoot up in the
 sky from what looked like a huge translucent caterpillar bathed in pixie
 dust, before it exploded raining swaths of cleansing fire among lesser
 demons and imps riding hellish hounds, burning them into oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But still, more of them came, in a nightmarish vision of the terror that
 was to be unleashed.
 It was hideous.
 It was unfortunately, quite real.
 And it was doom, on a monumental scale.
 I felt I had been cheated.
 Perhaps if I'd really understood how bad the odds were, I'd just have a
 last good night's sleep and spend the rest of eternity looking morose,
 just as I was probably looking when Eileen slapped me hard across the face,
 without the slightest warning:

 On my end, it was simply an idea put into practice, albeit I would've been
 a raving lunatic were I not immortal.
 Which hadn't really proven its usefulness, and was about to put to the
 test, not as a solid battlefield advantage which I'm sure every fighting
 man would be interested in, but as a way to put my stratagem into action.

\begin_layout Standard
As things were, the approaching hordes of Hell weren't as relentless as
 I would have hoped in their pursuit of overrunning our position; instead
 of simply barraging us with hellfire, storming the impromptu trenches and
 cover positions of what few defenders remained with their halberds, axes,
 scything claws and gaping maws, they were content to keep our heads down
 with occasional shots, and keep everyone busy by assaulting a position
 with enough force as to press us further inside a smaller perimeter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It felt like squeezing that very last bit of toothpaste from the tub with
 your nails.
 It also meant that they were effectively stalling, waiting for something
 to happen, or maybe someone to arrive.
 Maybe they wanted to trap us between the hammer and the anvil first, waiting
 for Falconi's men to get through the doorway, and make things finally impossibl
e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A runner had gone back with a message, sharing my plan with Jules.
 An answer had come back a few minutes later, telling us that the hardest
 part of their trials was probably over since the lawyers in Falconi's disposal
 - after having obtained a cease & desist order - were forced to retreat
 for a recess because of the `non-government organization' profile of the
 Normal Bureau.
 That and a few of Jules well-placed Magnum shots seemed to have put them
 effectively out of the fight, and only the lycans and werewolves remained
 alongside Falconi's head-honcho demon lackeys, and they too seemed to be
 in-fighting over `who is the most bad-ass of them all'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least, it seemed we would be safe from a backdoor attack.
 Which meant I was ready to start running around the various trenches, emplaceme
nts, positions, and generally make it painfully obvious and clear as rain,
 that I was showing them the finger, calling them jackasses, and generally
 making it well-known that I thought they were nothing more than useless
 demonic hordes only good for filling up tar pits with tar, and stirring
 the open-air shit baths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the saying goes, if Muhammad can't go to the mountain, let the mountain
 come to him.
 I looked at Eileen, and she gave me a nod and smile.
 She didn't say `good luck', but I knew she meant it anyway.
 I pulled myself out of cover, and started off with a walking pace, waving
 a hand for everyone to see, smiling casually as if this was a friendly
 get-together, or perhaps a get-to-know-us-better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'd told the guys to hold out a little while longer while I performed my
 antics, and keep Alice and Bob (the caterpillar and unicorn respectively
 - I didn't know at the time that they were such a nice couple) firing away,
 especially at the hell-bat swarms that seemed to fill the place with their
 droppings.
 The guys knew we were going to draw some attention, but they probably hadn't
 expected I'd do what I was doing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I walked around their positions, the rate of fire dropped substantially,
 and I invariably saw pretty much everyone give me a weird look, or rather
 a strange kind of stare.
 The kind of stare that people give that weird, obscure relative, that no-one
 really knows intimately, everyone always mixes up with someone else, just
 can't help pointing at him, comment on his improper attire, and eventually
 admire him just because he

\begin_layout Standard
And that was exactly what I was doing, because I just looked like I was
 talking a walk, without seeming to care, exactly because I didn't, and
 I didn't because I couldn't die.
 But that point was lost to all those, friendlies and enemies alike, who
 saw me climb up to this small improvised parapet made of dirt, kind of
 like an anthill actually, and shout out of the top of my lungs, extending
 both arms, facing the general direction of the hordes and giving them the
 finger in such a pronounced way:

I think my voice was carried around by an unusual echo that managed to somehow
 sideline the ever-mounting hubbub of the chanting that seemed to be coming
 from what in effect was probably a demonic choir battalion, complete with
 lecterns-on-wheels drawn by cats.
 Nothing unusual about them, just plain old cats.
 Even these mysterious hooded figures seemed to have stopped, and gasped
 at my taunting show of defiance, and gasped audibly in unison, before silence
 - a silence that was too complete for comfort - followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I grinned smugly and thought that I should've thought about this much earlier,
 that my commanding presence was such a natural gift that I could exploit
 in so many ways, and that was just the kind of impression I want to make
 on the battlefield.
 And then I saw tens of thousands of the demons roar, growl and howl, wildly
 flailing their weapons and shouting a mix of obscenities and curses that
 even though indecipherable in their abyssal tongues, their intended purpose
 was clear enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What kind of impressed me as well, was that I didn't actually have to run
 around to make my presence felt.
 I was now the center of attention, mostly in a bad way.
 It was also perplexing to see all these demons suddenly revitalized out
 of their ordered chaos into acting much more like themselves; I was starting
 to believe they actually enjoyed being taunted, even in such a basic level
 as being given the finger (two fingers in Britain, but in Topeka, even
 in the after-world Topeka - and naturally in Memphis - it's just the one
 finger).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I went a bit overboard quite possibly, seeing the instant success
 of the finger and accompanying defiant shout, and decided it was time for
 something that usually I'd consider crass and childish, and certainly not
 something I'd believe could be taking in place in what could be considered
 the biblical fight for Armageddon: I turned around, dropped my pants, and
 showed them their ass.
 I believe I could see Eileen looking at me, right before she buried her
 palms in her face.

Before I had a chance to use the opportunity that question posed to dig
 deeper inside of me and perhaps give a more in-depth answer than `don't
 worry, I can't die', I felt my bottom burn up as intensely as it would
 have had it been immersed in lava, and all the while my senses reported
 that I was in fact in mid-air, rushing to meet with a concrete wall, while
 there was this terrible itch across my back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next few moments consisted of a jarring feeling of being mushed into
 a pulp against a concrete wall with a flaming, molten lava rock shot smack
 on your behind.
 It wouldn't have been that bad had my clothing not caught on fire.
 I pulled myself together and out of the concrete, spent a few seconds to
 notice that I hadn't left a stamp on the wall so much as made an impression,
 and then turned back to the once-more silent crowd of hell's soldiers who
 seemed to be craving a proper answer to their flagrant show of lack of
 manners, shooting someone in the back.

And they just roared enthusiastically, breaking any and all formation; they'd
 forgotten about rules, they had violated orders, and they seemed they couldn't
 care less about being demoted to less-than-imp status, or perhaps turned
 into horned ants.
 It seemed that pretty much their minds, their very spirits were indeed
 focused on one thing: grabbing me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They rushed with all the speed and terrible force of a tsunami, some even
 dropping whatever they carried as weapons.
 Eileen and I exchanged glances and we both instantly knew that we were
 soon about to find out exactly how solid my plan was.
 I also knew that both of us tried not to think that it now all rested on
 a pony on a stick, which no matter how elaborate or technically and scientifica
lly advanced it might actually be, was still shaped like a god-damn pony
 on a stick.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I heard someone say, even as I saw everyone fire off their last bursts,
 sometimes followed by the ominous sound of a hollow bolt signifying someone's
 out of ammo.
 Fireballs started to land all around, as if hell was raining upon us.
 Every hellish creature that could fly was flapping its wings, of many shapes
 and sizes, forming into a huge combined swarm that blocked most of the
 sickly, orange light in the sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I saw the sheer scale of it, and every hair on my body stood up.
 Seeing them amassed, fighting slowly their way through, forcing us to fall
 back little by little was demoralising, bleak, and plain ugly.
 Seeing them rush onwards with wild abandon, lusting for pure chaos to be
 unleashed among their ranks, was terrifying.
 It was what the stories about the end of days were always about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And all I did was wait for Eileen to throw me the pony-on-a-stick and countdown
 to the last moment before they actually got to me, standing on the exact
 spot where the very center of the pentagram was, the place where I would
 be ritually sacrificed, crucified, and generally very probably die should
 the pony fail to deliver its stated design goal, which was to obliterate
 the lot of them, and send them to hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right about that time, and while the seconds grew ever longer, but fewer
 still, as the distance between me and the demons diminished with every
 bat of the eye, I saw this great shadow cover me, as if a small cloud had
 picked me out of everyone else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As everyone around me formed a last perimeter, a hopeless circle, some grimly
 pulling out their katanas or heirloom swords with all sorts of blessed
 rolls and holy seals of papal approval (but thankfully, no silly hats),
 I saw what had been throwing that shadow over me, and only had enough time
 to gasp, before it landed right on top of me with tremendous force, using
 me like some sort of training mattress to halt its fall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It literally threw me off me my feet and I was thrown a few yards away,
 my one-fingered salute flag now completely in ruins, but having served
 its purpose.
 I shook my head, while the pain from the impact that should have cracked
 every bone on my body and rendered me nothing more than a rag doll or perhaps
 a soft crash test dummy, disappeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could still hear the chaos all around, sporadic and quite probably last
 shots being fired, as well as the surprised gasps the appearance of the
 demon like a blight falling from the sky had caused among what few men
 remained standing.
 I glanced at Eileen who looked tense but determined, her hands glowing
 with that white-hot intensity that meant she was ready to rumble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I saw what the fuss was all about, because the demon I was looking
 at was exactly what the term `lean, mean, killing machine' aimed to describe,
 only not as lean, and definitely more mean than a kid at school eating
 all the candy from the other kids and calling the girl wearing braces `metal-mo
uthed freak'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that was guaranteed by its height of twenty feet, bifurcated barbed
 tail, red-hot flaming hoofs instead of feet, claws as large as jet engine
 fan blades, and a devilish smile that said that this one knew he had a
 natural capacity to instill gaping awe, mind-numbing fear, and send men
 early to their graves.
 Not only that, he was definitely one of those fellas who enjoyed spreading
 death, destruction and despair.
 He folded his leathery wings and said through a mouth filled with granite
 teeth and a set of fangs that could have been tusks for all I knew:

His voice was like rattling embers.
 I had the most definite and distinct privilege to not have met such a demon
 in the few hours in my reinstated career as a demon hunter, paranormal
 fighter, and half-assumed, half-proclaimed almost-unwilling protector of
 every human with a soul (meaning journalists and lawyers were quite possibly
 exempt).
 While everyone around me stood warily their ground, knowing full well that
 this was a distraction my plan had not accounted for, I stood up, dusted
 off my too-tight-for-comfort football pants, and replied, almost wanting
 to know the reason behind that question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, thank God, I don't,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said, and meant it.
 I then heard a very familiar, heavy New Jersey accent, with all the nasal
 qualities and street-wise flair, wiseguy tone, and Italian-bred fluidity
 of Marco Falconi, saying what I instantly knew was true:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who the fuck did ya expect? It's a me, Mario! You fucking wiseguy, you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said in that joking manner mobsters like Falconi used right before they
 stabbed someone in the back with a screwdriver or choked someone to death
 with a shoe lace.
 He was grinning widely, perhaps showing off his capability to choose between
 swallowing a car whole or chewing it first.
 Perhaps there was something seriously wrong with his facial muscles, but
 that wasn't probable as him just enjoying himself immensely for once again,
 ready and willing to mess up everything.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I felt this was probably his idea of settling things his way, having his
 personal hand in all this plan of his, from start to finish, from the first
 to the last stroke.
 He was that kind of a prick, and I'm certain all his charm as Falconi didn't
 go to waste in his demon form, but was all the more exaggerated.
 My mind raced with what I should do, while the moment where I'd had to
 fire up the pony was approaching fast.
 While I was thinking, others preferred the more direct approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Someone from the Bureau men thought it wouldn't hurt to try and cut the
 demons leg off, even though it was as thick as a tree.
 Falconi barely looked his way when he simply flicked his wrist and his
 claws cut him down, not unlike swatting a fly, only much more blood and
 gore was involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was the exact moment Eileen unleashed a lightning bolt she had been
 drawing energy for ever since Falconi appeared.
 The air around me parted with explosive intensity.
 The after-world around me was lit up with blinding white light that for
 a moment obscured everything from sight, casting fierce shadows on anything
 it touched, and it touched everything.
 It was hundreds of times stronger than what Bob the unicorn could shoot
 of its horn.
 it was the most awesome display of firepower I had ever seen, rivaling
 nature's and man's most powerful devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing normal, alive, or made by man could have withstood that amount of
 concentrated, focused power.
 But Falconi was still standing there once the smoke and haze cleared moments
 later.
 He was apparently visibly shaken, and of his skin singed as well; his great,
 dragon-like wings had been reduced to shredded bone and straps of leather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And all the while, from the corner of my eye I could see innumerable hordes
 all around us, finally having reached us at a stone's throw, ready to dismember
, gore and utterly annihilate everyone.
 I could even see large, spiked, infernally hot chains, the ones meant to
 shackle me in place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though I had probably gone temporarily deaf from Eileen's thunderbolt, I
 could hear the incantations again, reaching a climax I had thought would
 only come a lot later, when everything had already been lost and only I
 had remained as sad witness and unwilling executioner of all of creation's
 last will.
 But I could hear them now, satanic verse after satanic verse, uttered with
 that same regurgitating quality those European metal bands preferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I could see Eileen almost spent, faint and withering, unable to even stay
 afloat in her incorporeal body.
 I could see the last few men and women gathered around me and Falconi,
 bracing themselves for a last stroke, a last defiant kill, their faces
 grim but flushed red from the heat of the battle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I could definitely see Falconi, looking as smug and confident as ever,
 slowly pacing his way towards me, ready to gloat about their impending
 victory and his elevations from a prince to perhaps a spiritual successor
 of sorts.
 It was plain for everyone who could spare a look that he felt positively
 triumphant and totally invincible.
 There were only a few more moments left before everyone was cut down in
 a flurry of claws, swords, axes, bullets and hellfire, only a few more
 moments before the end of everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen used whatever little remained in her spirit to throw me the pony
 she was safely keeping with her until the last moment, which had just come.
 I grabbed it with one hand, still looking at Falconi, whose eyes had met
 only a flick earlier exchanging gazes like messages of hate and defiance,
 curses, and the odd term of endearment like `you little fuck'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in those eyes, through that gaze that worked as a bridge for a silent
 communion, a thing only possible between creatures, human or otherwise,
 that had gazed deep into the fabric of the cosmos, I saw a flare of uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the fear of something new, it was the sensation that something was
 amiss, that something had been overlooked, underestimated, forgotten, misplaced.
 It begun a simple hint of ignorance that turned into an avalanche of fear,
 uncertainty and doubt with all the rapid alacrity that the demonic synapses
 of his brain's equivalent could deliver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an instant, as I grasped the pony-on-a-stick with eyes closed, searching
 into my inner self, my most natural basic self to come through, to feel,
 to remember, dig inside that animal cortex and light up those searchlights
 of my soul, to really remember, to really think.
 In that split fraction of less than a second, where Falconi was tormented
 by waves of uncertainty, and I was probing my inner self trying to remember
 what my brain refused to by itself, there was a sweet balance, a cold time
 of glory for an uncaring universe where everything was possible, and every
 moment could change everything, for ever, no matter the cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then just when Falconi was reaching to grab that pony out of my stick,
 I believed I knew, that I remembered.
 I folded my legs around the stick, clenched my arms around the pony's head,
 and leaped into the air, shouting as if everyone, living and dead, should
 hear it, and know it was done:

Even though he had been very vocative in celebrating the demons' defeat
