\begin_layout Chapter
In the beginning there was everything
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's easier to write this down in the first person; none of the messy indirect
 speech stuff.
 None of the `he did that and then had he'.
 No.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, nothing happened at that time.
 Even though there was everything.
 Does that make any sense? Allow me to more fully explain.
 Hopefully, by the end of the book it will have made just enough sense to
 keep reading, and just enough nonsense to get published.
 At least, if that's how publishers work in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because I'm from the past.
 Don't try and calculate the when; it is not a certain time I'm talking
 about.
 I've always been from the past, from wherever you place yourself in the
 streams of time - even if it's essentially wrong to think of time as a
 constant, unique flow.
 See, I was there, right from the beginning; a beginning nested in so many
 beginning before this one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Believe me, I saw how it all went down.
 I saw the tiniest of things in the smallest of space and all that crap
 those folks that call themselves scientists believe in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's right, it's a belief.
 And I'm telling you, I saw all that and then some; believe me if you will,
 and laugh at me if you won't but it was nothing like these folks have been
 thinking it was like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know it's hard to explain.
 That's another reason I'm writing this all down.
 Also, I reckon it's quite important.
 I've heard talk that some have attempted this before, with a varying degree
 of success: some went crazy in the process, others simply vanished as if
 they had never existed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before I go any further, I should remind you I wasn't alive all the time
 in between, so there might be some dark spots.
 Places and names could be important, but then again it's only one version
 of events.
 What matters is..
 Everything matters, don't you see?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I guess you don't.
 I guess you will.
 That's why my life is out of love.
 No, wait, that sounds like some gangsta song I picked up on the way.
 Call it interference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway.
 It sounds a bit crazy but things might've started out on a large piece
 of rock.

\begin_layout Standard
Paul was sitting on a comfortably plush pillow, large enough to actually
 lie down on.
 His eyes were wide open but his head was drooped low, as if checking for
 signs of a strange new life right in front of his splayed feet.
 Sadly enough, there was nothing but sand there.
 A badly shaped castle made of wet sand and twigs occupied a spot nearby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All around hiim, the imagery of a lush lagoon paradise enveloped him warmly.
 Coconut trees and thick bushes of exotic plants swayed lightly in the breeze.
 The sounds of an ocean not very far away vibrated gently in his inner ear;
 a mellow sun indiscreetly cast soft shadows in a sapphire-blue sky.
 Thin clouds paced themselves like ladies clad in white lace on a promenade
 built in heaven.
 The emerald-glazed waters only rose far enough up to the sand castle, without
 ever reaching it; it stood as a barrier in that sense, a ramshackle fort
 between Paul's beach and the wild blue yonder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just a projection though.
 Paul made it go away.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't want to calm down,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sighed.
 The lagoon and everything else that came with it vanished in a jarring
 fashion, leaving nothing but an opaque black shiny surface behind them.
 An ambient light shone on every surface in the room, its source magnificently
 obfuscated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paul was now standing in the middle of a hemispherical chamber, its black
 walls non-descript, dull rather than imposing, dangerous-looking or ominous.
 It was meant to be soothing; Paul had begun to loathe it in the past few
 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At least the sand is real,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and got up, brushing off the last few grains of sand that clung
 stubbornly on to the cloth of his pants.
 A disembodied voice filled the chamber: it was clean, concise and carried
 a slightly whimsical tone.
 It had a carefully tuned characteristic - it sounded neither male or female.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I like the pants; quite the throwback,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Spare me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Paul and rubbed his eyes as if he'd just woken up.
 He ruffled his black short-cropped hair; it was a sign of being nervous.
 He simply sat there in the middle of the sand-laden chamber for a few moments,
 his hands firmly dug in the pants pockets.
 Clothing was another retro feature of his personality; black, cotton-woven
 pants covered his legs and he wore a green-dyed woolen vest over his torso.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paul was considered in many circles and from many perspectives, a weird
 person.
 He was medium-built and slightly short in modern terms, his physique unaltered.
 His brown eyes were possessed of a sparky glint though; the latest in augmented
 utilitarian optronics.
 Still, he kept them offline most of the time and allowed them to feed him
 his surroundings in the most unremarkable, basic human way.
 Most people did not believe a man of his status and responsibility was
 still, for the most part, a rather dull, limited human being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It all had to do with being the Co-ordinating Entity of Stellar Synergies,
 the single most powerful conglomerate in the Solar system, controlling
 the majority of mining zones and industrial facilities scattered between
 Mars and Jupiter, in the exorbitantly rich asteroid belt.
 In social gatherings, it made him a really popular figure.
 In reality though, it made his head spin most of the time.
\end_layout

They're still waiting you know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said, trying to remind Paul of the fact without being too pushy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know they're waiting.
 They're being paid to wait.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll have to agree, they're kind of uneasy.
 Waiting only multiplies that.
 I've been told it's not a good thing.

 Paul said and almost wished he'd picked up some kind of drug addiction.
 Real drugs though; an actual substance in the bloodstream.
 Somehow Paul thought biochemically imbalancing your brain was so much better
 than the purely stimulae-based digital stuff everyone felt it was okay
 to get absorbed in these days.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's like we're on TV,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added and scoffed before starting to pace around the room, the sand's
 abrasive nature fitting the raspiness of his voice.
 The disembodied voice tried to sound perplexed, for the sake of conversation.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've insisted that I sometimes play coy.
 I'm an AI, not a mind-reader,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the gender-neutral voice replied with a carefully measured level of hurt.
\end_layout

 Paul said derisively looking at his feet.

You're not my friend; don't call me by name.
 I hate it when people do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he added.
\end_layout

I'm not exactly people, though the definition is a bit hazy.
 I'd say I should be feeling hurt, but then again feelings are supposedly
 reserved for people, in which -

Just shut the fuck up! I'm trying to think!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Paul shouted, kicked the sand-castle next to him into oblivion as if it
 somehow was responsible for everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A thick silence ensued.
 Paul sighed and became more like his usual self again; he tried to relax
 his muscles, flapping his arms and legs like an athlete would right before
 the start of a race.
 It didn't feel like it was working; he was still tense like a rope made
 of marble strands.
 Hard, but brittle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Alright.
 I'll just have to tell them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just like that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the AI asked, disbelief carefully modulated in its tone.
 What Paul was about to do, had ranked really low on the probability estimates
 and simulations; he'd really taken it by surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do they need a fucking picture as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Paul growled and stood for a moment before an immaculate doorway appeared
 on the black, glass-like surface of the chamber, as if it had been there
 all along if you just looked at it from the right angle.
 It reminded Paul of smoke and mirrors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Smoke and mirrors,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he muttered to himself absent-mindedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I understand the reference, but not the implied train of thought,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the AI chipped in as the door to the chamber opened, letting in bright,
 clinical-looking white light flood the limited space of the chamber in
 a blinding way.
 Paul's eyes adjusted automatically, but he squinted nevertheless for just
 a moment; the memory of sunlight was still strong in the animal parts of
 his brain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who the fuck asked you to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and stepped outside.
 He felt the hard, unyielding white surface of the nanoceramite surface
 adjust; it was set to a grassy, earthly feeling.
