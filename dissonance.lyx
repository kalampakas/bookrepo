\begin_layout Chapter*
Necessity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke pulled down his visor.
 A freezing gust of wind buffeted against his face suddenly; it made him
 swivel around like someone had slapped him; he lost his balance and fell
 on his back.
 Fresh powdery snow went up in a small silver cloud around him.
 Fresh snow in Greenland.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn laughed with hands crossed over his chest and a carefully constructed
 grin on his face.
 He helped Sousuke back on his feet and started walking towards the crawler,
 shaking his head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half-way there he paused to pick up the surveyor unit; he brushed some snow
 off his beard, powered down the panel, folded the telescopic legs and placed
 the very expensive piece of eqipment across his shoulders.
 Bjorn worked as a lumberjack before he signed up for this one, back when
 Hemmeldalen was still green.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He ventured a glimpse at Sousuke; he was struggling to walk upwind; Bjorn
 shook his head once more, and chuckled.
 He couldn't for the life of him, understand what made a guy like Sousuke
 take this job.
 He knew his geology stuff, but other than that..
 Everyday seemed like his first day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone laughed at the new guy, that much was to be expected.
 The psychologists on the evaluation team always noted it was a sign of
 good mental health.
 A few practical jokes and a some seriously bad efforts at humor were the
 order of the day at seventy-four degrees latitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except Sousuke had been stationed in Field Zeta for three years, without
 rotation.
 It hadn't grown on him; it had made him sick.
 But somehow he never asked to transfer out; he didn't complain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three weeks of leave each year, and that was it.
 That was his lifeline with the world that despite the climate change and
 the Disconnect of '33 and the Big Melt of '35, still had beautiful warm
 beaches filled with young girls in miniscule bikinis.
 Even in Hokkaido in November.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three hours by helicopter to Spitsbergen, then a four-hour flight to Murmansk
 to the Roskosmos SSTO.
 From there on, it was a three-hour suborbital flight to almost any place
 on Earth.
 And still, when it came time to buy that ticket, he always flew to Sapporo.
 He somehow always wanted to see the half-sunken family house at Nemuro,
 the cherry treetops grazing the sea surface like dead corals.
 He tried to remember what the blossoms looked like; a faint memory of a
 fragrant smell came up instead.
 And bees.
 He remembered their sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He must've been woolgathering there for a moment; Bjorn was shouting at
 him to move on.
 He put on his best effort at a smile and gave a thumbs up to Bjorn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wished there was some other way to go about it, but he had committed
 himself.
 Everything was going to change, soon enough.
 For the better.
 He shouldn't worry too much though; he would do his part and then they
 would either fail or succeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There could be no middle ground, no chance at negotiating or talking things
 over once it went down.
 Not even if they wanted to.
 No failsafe, no human factor.
 Except himself, of course.
 And Joussef, Jun, and Richard.
 They'd all do their part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn shouted at him again from the relative comfort of the crawler, a lit
 smoke already in hand:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a reason that was wholly above and beyond Sousuke's understanding, Bjorn
 seemed to relish in the job of running around in a snow crawler in the
 undecided day or night of the Arctic, searching almost blindly for thorium
 deposits in a faceless white desert.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it was the rush of discovery, or the associated finder's fee.
 Perhaps it was just Bjorn being Norwegian.
 Robots might have been able to do the job better, cheaper, and a whole
 lot warmer for any humans involved in the process.
 But they couldn't be trusted; not like regular folk itching for a chance
 to live the life.
 Anything that could transmit and receive couldn't be trusted these days.
 The Disconnect had made sure of that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke jumped inside the crawler, closed the door behind him, reached for
 his thermo and poured a cup of almost scalding hot tea.
 He didn't sip, he just held on to it for warmth.
 Bjorn started the engine and focused his attention on the control panel,
 waiting for the 'Engine Ready' sign to light up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He drew a puff from his cigarette and offered Sousuke one, purely from habit.
 Sousuke shook his head, still wearing the heavy fur-lined hood: real fur,
 an overpriced luxury, never mind banned by the UN, or what it had lately
 voted to call itself the Earth Coalition.
 As if the name `United Nations' somehow offended the Big Three.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke relaxed a bit into his seat, stretching his legs.
 The cabin of the crawler was spacious, but spartan.
 He'd turned an empty display socket into a small sort of basket.
 There was a small nook somewhere in the plastic that doubled as a cup holder.
 Sousuke placed the cup there and closed his eyes for a moment.
 The engine revved up suddenly, making the crawler lurch forward like a
 startled beast.
 The tea spilled; Sousuke looked at Bjorn who simply shrugged and drove
 on through the snow.
\end_layout

There's more where that came from, no?

You could have asked,

 Bjorn retorted in an equally dry manner,

Still,

 came the bleak answer.

\begin_layout Standard
Stan passed on the borsht and instead made his way to the pantry.
 His wrinkled nose gave away the fact that the smell put him off.
 Sergei shrugged and dug in heartily, though rather noisily.
 Miki and Elaine were sitting at one table, playing a rather convoluted
 version of chess, involving dice and an imaginary toroidal chessboard.
 It hadn't caught on with the rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were heavily absorbed, and didn't take notice of Stan nibbling away
 at their snacks.
 Souvenirs' from a trip southside: goat's cheese and garlic bread from France;
 smoked salmon from Finland.
 They didn't even take notice when Stan sat down next to them, pretending
 to watch while stuffing himself shamelessly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn entered the small but comfy mess room, all red-faced and smiling.
 Sousuke followed close behind, his thermo in hand and a more than usually
 sore look on his face.
 Stan had the courtesy to swallow before asking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's with Takahashi?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn gave a shrug and made his way to the toilet, while Sousuke simply
 ignored Stan and vanished inside the small kitchen.
 Stan downed another bite of cheese before talking to practically none other
 than himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's with everyone? Not enough snow? Too much white in your day? What
 is it this time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sergei looked up from his meal, opted to pitch in by shrugging and happily
 continued sipping his soup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I spilled his tea!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came Bjorn's muffled shout from the toilet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

All of it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, asked Stan leaning back on his chair.
 Elaine momentarily raised her head searching for the source of the small
 raucus, but gave no sign it was about to ruin her game.
 Miki took Elaine's knight, smiled and announced her victory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Checkmate.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaine took a moment to look at the chessboard like it had grown legs.
 Befuddled, she asked rather haplessly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No? No way out? If I..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Checkmate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 repeated Miki, barely shaking her head.
 She then turned to Stan with a frown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you eat all the cheese?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan licked his lips and looked at the ceiling mischievously.
 Elaine buried her face in her palms, her voice barely audible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Merdre..
 Three times in a row.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn came out of the toilet with his work suit unzipped, hanging around
 his waist like a peeled banana.
 A lot of sarcasm but just a hint of genuine concern went into his question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't it strange that a quarter of the world's thorium stock relies on a
 bunch of geeks with a lot of time, a lot of money, and very little in the
 way of spending either?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke came out of the kitchen holding a sword.
 An unsheathed sword.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan was the first one to exclaim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wow! A real-life samurai.
 Just like in those old movies.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They all smiled.
 Bjorn laughed.
 Sousuke did not seem to share their humourous disposition.
 He was looking intently at the shining metal of the blade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't that the antique you brought in last time? What was the name for -
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bjorn's sentence was cut in half, as was his throat.
 Jets of blood sprayed Sousuke as he moved with sharp, calculated steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sergei was trying to smash through an observation pane when Sousuke's blade
 severed his spine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stan tried to put up a fight with a shovel that happened to be lying around
 but his one swing never connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sousuke was flawless, each move of the blade a killing blow; Stan's head
 rolled off his spine like it had been fake all along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Elaine rushed to the door only to find it locked from the inside - everyone
 had been too absorbed to notice.
 Her death wound was clean, through the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Miki sat frozen still at the table, clutching at the chessboard.
 It happened; some animals never flee - they accept the inevitable nature
 of death, seeing through the falseness of their instincts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her evolved brain though had to know, so she asked, tears running down her
 face.
 Amidst sobs and silent, muffled cries she managed to croak:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why? Whatever the reason, why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I hate you, Miki.
 I hate the whole world.

Her voice died abruptly in her throat with a horrible gurgling sound.

\begin_layout Standard
It was just him now.
 The katana had served its purpose.
 He didn't know why exactly, but he felt compelled to bury the Fukushima
 Masamune in the snow, next to their bodies, leaving the hilt exposed.
 It would have to do instead of a cross.
 He looked at his watch; there was still ample time to start his descent
 to the Pit until what passed for evening at this latitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat down on a work uniform next to the sword, and crossed his legs; he
 breathed deeply, letting the cold inrush of air revitalize his senses.
 The sun's blurry orange shape somehow felt as cold as the snow.
 There was no warmth in that sight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spent a moment in reflection; he did that often but he always felt constricte
d, restrained as if imprisoned by a higher authority than himself.
 Somehow, he felt all the dead people around him made him serene, liberated.
 He smiled despite himself at the thought that he had almost forgotten the
 feeling of serenity; they irony that he had to kill five people to feel
 at peace was not entirely lost on him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He remembered Miki's question then, and he somehow felt his answer had been
 - on retrospect - incomplete.
 The least he could've done was take a deep breath right then and there
 and tell her why he hated the world.
 Explain, make her understand.
 Maybe she could realise it wasn't personal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew he didn't need some sort of validation or acceptance of what he
 had done, or more importantly what he was about to do.
 He had made up his mind, he just couldn't tell when exactly.
 Maybe even before he had been selected for this task.
 Perhaps it was when he saw his grandfather's orchard being slowly eaten
 away by the rising sea in just a few months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it had been the Disconnect that had cleared up his mind.
 He felt it had freed him from all the digital detritus of a quietly but
 falsely discontent life, from all the by-products of a society hell-bent
 on pacing itself out of existence.
 It made him think.
 That was when he went to the temple at Sengakuji, hunting for his inner
 demon, his own personal

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his search, he found out what humanity lacked: a sense of balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nations had failed, time and again; the monstrously deceiving financial
 system couldn't sustain the boom-and-doom cycle.
 As a means of hoarding wealth, energy became scarce even in the developed
 world.
 Feeding on the human propensity to dream, imagine and create, the global
 information network slowly turned into a parasite that took root into people's
 hearts and minds twisting them, enslaving them, watching them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Disconnect changed all that.
 The network did not devolve or wither away; it went away with a bang.
 Nobody is perfectly sure why it happened.
 Horrible error or extreme terrorism, it nearly plunged the globe into unremitti
ng chaos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every connected machine became infested.
 Efforts to reinstate a new network failed.
 No virus could be detected.
 Even radiation-hardened systems failed consistently.
 The networking infrastructure collapsed.
 The era of the internet had died.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Along with it came most communications, industry and finance.
 Anything more advanced than a radio or a pulse tone telephone was practically
 impossible to operate in a meaningful way.
 Someone had let the world slip back into its Gernsback pajamas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People woke up having to learn how to live anew.
 Sousuke remembered how distraught his father had looked to him those first
 few days, while his grandfather smiled wryly, watering his watermelons
 and reminiscing about his own childhood.
 `The only net we knew was the fishing kind', he had said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't the complete catastrophe the media had predicted; those were hard
 times, but famine and disease did not spread like wildfire - however dependent
 the world had become around its gadgets and smart networked machines, a
 man still had his own hands to rely upon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the things without faces or hands that had it worst: corporations.
 About to hang themselves with a rope they had pretty much made themselves,
 they tried to think big for a change.
 But only after the Big Melt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only measurable cause was a freak increase in solar radiation.
 That afact alone though, couldn't account for almost half the Greenland
 ice sheet melting away in just two years.
 Extreme measures were put in place; weather systems went to hell.
 The global conglomerates offered to practically buy most nations around
 the Earth and in exchange provide the means to survive.
 Few could refuse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corporations invested every last iota of what remained of their resources,
 human and otherwise, into what became known as the `shift'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thorium-based nuclear power became a main source of electrical power production,
 alongside the solar forests of the Sahara and the Great Energy Reef in
 the Pacific, right on top of the dying Great Barrier Reef.
 The Chinese having founded their Second Empire, relied on practical, sustained
 nuclear fusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Space became a real priority for the first time: the mass driver on the
 moon supplied Earth with cheap processed strategic minerals, while modified
 Soyuz tugboats hauled asteroids for exploitation near mineral refineries
 at the Langrangian points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Alps had melted away, but the Himalayas made for excellent skiing.
 The tropics were delineated anew.
 Winter - for the most part - became a historic reference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In just two decades everything had seemed to change, while it had actually
 remained the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not to Sousuke.
 Not to the others like him.
 Joussef at Bilma, Richard at Lizard Island, Jun at Lake Nasihu.
 At 20:00 UTA, the world would plunge into darkness, and humanity would
 either truly try and evolve or die out.
 Just like so many species before man.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got up and walked to the service elevator.
 He depressed the descent button, and watched the various strata of rock
 roll past him evenly, as if he was walking down the two mile shaft at an
 easy pace.
 The main generator facility was a huge natural underground cavern, carefully
 modified to accomodate the single largest power generation station in the
 world, an array of thousands of thorium reactors capable of producing energy
 in the scale of terawatts.
 Room-temperature superconductors carried it through the rock and across
 the ocean bed to America and Europe alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Africa had become completely self-sufficient due to the Sahara Solar Field,
 and Asia was being fed by the Chinese Empire's fusion stations.
 Australia and Japan relied on the Great Barrier Reef.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four central locations provided the world with more than enough energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it wasn't free.
 Nothing, ever, was free.
 Except for their own conscience, their own spirit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did not expect to be lauded; far from it, there were no misconceptions
 on how the childish masses of the human populace would greet their vision-come-
reality.
 There would be little in the way of assigning guilt and blame when the
 whole planet would be just another black spot in the night sky.
 When each man's reach would be as wide as any kingdom's, past or future
 alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words of Rudi came to mind then, in that bar in Magdeburg: `The world
 needs a reset button, and we will push it.' For the first time in a long
 while he smiled for noone to see.

\begin_layout Standard
The wall of the corridor was ridden with indication LEDs, a living tapestry
 of light.
 The air was stale; it had a heavy copper scent about it.
 The warmth from the heat exchangers was a stark contrast to the temperature
 at the surface.
 A gentle breeze flowed through the maze of valve computers.
 There was no victorianesque quality to them, he noticed; simply a crude
 lack of imagination, a persistent lack of taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He walked through the maze of interconnects and cabling grids.
 At times, he ventured a look upwards into the bleak emptiness of the cavern.
 There was the faintest light coming down from the ventilation shafts, a
 gray-blue light, its hue reminiscent of dark ice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a while, he reached the central distribution hub.
 From there, he would interfere with the neutron emission mechanism, and
 turn the whole grid into a giant ticking bomb.
 Joussef would reorient all the reflectors in such a way as to cause them
 to melt down, while Jun would simply release the dam's valves over at Lake
 Nasihu and cause all the water to flood onto the valley.
 Thinking about how people in power had relied on people once again because
 they could be trusted smelled like poetic justice to Sousuke.
 He laid down his backpack near an access panel, when he heard footsteps
 and a metallic, clicking sound that faintly echoed barely above the low-pitched
 hum of the machinery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

End of the line, Sousuke.
 Hands off the backpack.
 Just kick it towards me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said an unusually uncharacteristic voice, the voice of a man.
 Another pair of footsteps could be heard approaching pacefully, without
 hurry.
\end_layout

Who are you?

\end_inset

Wouldn't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said a female voice that somehow seemed way too familiar to Sousuke.
 She spoke with a heavy japanese accent.
 The realisation hit Sousuke too hard, too late.

Kaname?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked plainly.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I did need to, but I wanted to see you one last time.
 You do realise, three similar yet much less civilized conversations are
 taking place elsewhere.
 You probably want to know why, and I do want to tell you all the reasons.
 Because I hate you and your kind, Sousuke.
 You're just kids playing with adults.
 It's not about money and greed, or power, whatever your idea of the worlds
 powers might be.
 It's about survival.
 You'd wreck humanity in your neo-lutheran dream of simpler, darker days.
 You think we're alone out there.
 Would you do otherwise had you known we're not?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded accusing, but there was conviction behind those words.
 They rang true to Sousuke's ears.
 He brought a picture of Kaname playing hide-and-seek in the cherry orchard.
 She always managed to surprise him.
 His voice carried all his feelings of pity and grief into a simple word:

No.

 Kaname asked with a dry throat.
 Sousuke hesitated for a moment, then replied:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, we did..
 Kaname, was all that necessary then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man with the gun walked a few more paces towards Sousuke, his shoes
 claterring on the floor threateningly.
 Kaname tried to sound composed, but her voice wavered slightly:

Would it matter, whatever my answer was?

\begin_layout Standard
Dan walked up the creaky wooden steps and gazed at the old house.
 It looked neglected, almost abandoned.
 He had been gone for too long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was springtime in Sapporo again.
 The air was full of a fragrant essence; cherry blossoms strewn all over
 the hills.
 A cold breeze swept down throughout the foot of Mount Teine.
 Dan breathed in a lungful of air and then watched as his own breath turned
 into nothing more than little wisps of cloud.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled and stood in front of the door for a moment, searching his pockets.
 He found his ever peculiar-looking key and inserted into the padlock.
 A click and a moment later, he was pushing the door panes open, letting
 fresh air and the warm light of mid-morning enter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't bother with the suitcase or any of the other stuff lying around
 the house.
 There were motes of dust twirling wildly above the various packages, and
 an awful lot of it on the floor as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan cared little for any of those packaged household items, with one notable
 exception.
 With mischievous sparkling eyes, he picked one out of the rest with all
 the joy and mirth of a kid handed a chocolate bar: the small box was labeled

Tea Kit

.
 Two minutes later, he was boiling water in a small kettle on top of a small
 gas stove.
 He took a moment to gaze around the large hall: a soothing feeling washed
 over him in the knowledge that everything was just the way he had left
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the tea was ready, he poured himself a cup of and sat down on the wooden
 floor.
 For a few moments, he kept his eyes shut and simply let the aroma of green
 tea waft into his nostrils.
 It was to be expected that the tea would be stale, but he had hoped the
 smell would be less disenchanting.
 Still, it made him feel homely, attached.
 Such fleeting moments of peace were more than he had ever hoped for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He couldn't resist running his hands on the old cedar planks on the floor.
 They were filled with deep, rugged pores, jumbled cracks and woodwater
 that managed to seem almost deliberately engraved - unnatural yet familiar.
 The floor felt far too old to his touch, yet warm and endearing - it made
 Dan feel like he had grown up in this house.
 But that was not true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a sip of tea and reminded himself this was the house where Shimaki
 Kensaku had been born..
 At the back of his mind, he never really wanted to actually live in it.
 He had always thought it should belong to noone in particular.
 Perhaps he should have turned it into some kind of museum.
 Maybe next year.
 Or the year after that.
 Not yet, at any rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun was slowly dimming away behind the mountain, yet some wild sunrays
 bounced off the glimmering sea like flecks of sprinkled gold across his
 eyes.
 He squinted for a moment, and looked away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan blinked furiously until his vision redjusted and once he could see clearly
 once more he was startled by the figure of a wrinkled old man in a tweed
 suit, grinning widely with his hands glued to the sides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan was surprised; he wasn't expecting anyone.
 There wasn't much of a neighborhood to speak of either.
 The old man didn't even let him ponder about all that; he bowed smartly.
 The overall effect of a courteous fellow was only slightly marred by his
 japanese accent.
 It was english though, still:

He offered a handshake, all the while grinning profusely.
 The man struck Dan as vaguely familiar, in the way that most men his age
 looked about the same.
 He gave him a nod instead and motioned with his hand for the man to sit
 down, waving the handshake away with his implant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan pointed at the kettle and his cup of tea; the spare cup in the tea kit
 had proven useful more than once.
 The gentleman in the proverbially out-of-fashion tweed suit accepted happily.
 He bowed more deeply, sat down with graceful ease and took the cup of tea
 in both hands.
 He sipped politely but didn't seem to enjoy the aroma.

Dan gave it a moment's thought.
 It was pretty much along what he had been thinking - like a museum of sorts.
 He couldn't for the life of him understand what schoolchildren could find
 interesting or exciting about it though.
 He remembered endlessly boring schooltrips.
 He smiled thinly: he felt he had found his own spot in the never-ending
 circle of irony.
 He pointed at a heap of packages, still shrink-wrapped airtight and said
 to Mr.
 Kurawa, leaning slightly in front:

 the old man exclaimed with a burning smile across his face.
 Then he said something in Japanese that to Dan sounded more like a growling
 series of curse-words.
 He hadn't really managed to keep up with the language.
 While he was trying to sort out what the venerable teacher had said, he
 was staring at what was probably the whole class of children.
 Uniformed, standing upright, tightly and neatly arranged in rows and columns
 like toy soldiers, they looked like they had been drilled to death just
 for this day.
 Then he heard thin, child-like voices shouting on the top of their lungs:

The drive up to the house was a quick ten-minute ride, most of it a series
 of turns.
 Springtime had set in fully by now; every tree was in full bloom and the
 harsh sunrays were mellow and warm.
 Dan was sitting behind the wheels, and felt he could actually taste the
 sun.
 That's why he kept trying to catch the rays with an open mouth, laughing
 all by himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a Monday.
 One of those Mondays when you just look at the world outside your window
 and instantly become enthralled; when you just take off, and go fishing.
 When you just feel like ten years old, sitting on a bench having ice-cream,
 bathing in the sun like school's out and is never in session, ever again.
 The kind of day the world could burn for all you care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he arrived at the house, he noticed a school van parked outside.
 They were at it again; he really wasn't bothered, he'd told Mr.
 Kurawa.
 But he had insisted he would allow the kids to bother him, asking all sorts
 of questions.
 That was a teacher's job, he had said proudly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He admired that in the Japanese; not their multiple forms and ways of being
 polite, or their cherished, twisted form of samurai pride in a world wholly
 alien to noble notions.
 He admired their dependable character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They came in the morning school hours.
 He'd given Mr.Kurawa the keys, and would ring him whenever he'd be out for
 more than a couple of hours.
 Nothing ever went missing, and everything was always in place.
 For all he knew, they hadn't even stepped one foot inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He parked the sportster right beside the van, and gazed at the house.
 A canvas of sunlight graced the front porch; the gently swaying trees cast
 small patterns of soft shadow.
 When the kids left, Dan thought to himself, he'd have some tea outside.
 Maybe this time Mr.
 Kurawa could be persuaded to join.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he walked up the stairs, he was a bit surprised to see all the windows
 were closed shut, the inside of the house filled with shadows.
 Motes of dust tumbled lazily in front of the open door.
 It was as if the house was empty; as if it had been boarded up and left
 to rot for days.
 A strong, uneven smell of sweetness assaulted him suddenly.
 It reminded him of sugar burning in a pan.
 Cooking? That would be a first, Dan thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a few more steps and stood right under the doorway.
 He was barely able to make the outline of the staircase leading to the
 upper floor.
 What on earth were they doing? Film screening? And where was everyone?
 These thoughts kept going around in circles, as the smell grew stronger
 and pungent.
 It wasn't like caramel anymore; it reminded him of vomit.

Hello? Mr.
 Kurawa? Are you here? What's going on?

 Dan said, loud enough to be heard on the other floor as well.
 No answer came back.
 No sound other than the whistling of the trees.
 The wind was picking up outside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan took two steps inside.
 Instinct and a rising sense of worry turned his every step in a complicated
 matter; as if his legs were made of stone and he had just learned to walk.
 He hadn't felt this silly since high-school, but something in the back
 of his mind told him this really wasn't just a prank kids would pull.
 Dependable, Japanese school-children didn't do pranks.
 Not of this sort.
 He shouted once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hey, Mr.
 Kurawa.
 Just, show up.
 Light on now, OK?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, no answer.
 No movement, no light.
 The darkness in front of him was so total, the sun seemed to shy away from
 it right at the door.
 As if it could go no more.
 Then Dan heard the creaking of the door and a swooshing sound as it closed
 shut right behind him.
 He turned around instictively and almost lost his footing.
 He fumbled for the door handle, trying to pull it open again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As did most Japanese, Dan prided himself a peaceful man.
 Despite that half-truth, and despite his past experiences, he felt the
 anger inside him gorge suddenly, with only that slight provocation.
 This game, or prank, it really shouldn't get him going like that.
 He should deal with it, he thought, like a responsible adult of a certain
 education and character:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strangely enough, as he stood there facing the closed door, he felt the
 an ice-cold rush of air tingle the hair on his back, as if he was stark
 naked.
 And a sound like rocks tumbling down into a frothing river started to echo
 distantly.
 He slowly turned around and still saw nothing.
 For a moment he was about to erupt into a frenzy, running wild inside the
 house, just to feel the walls on each end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then a man not very much unlike Mr.
 Kurawa showed up, appearing from the shadows as if an invisible source
 of light shone at his face, which was in fact covered by a mask.
 Dan was startled and involuntarily took a step back.
 The mask seemed familiar; it was one of those used in the Kabuki theater.
 
\shape italic

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan heard those words in his mind.
 After only a second's pause, he wished he had just 
\shape italic
thought
\shape default
 he'd heard these words.
 The man in the mask, perhaps hopefully Mr.
 Kurawa and not some other nut, hadn't taken it off.
 He hadn't moved an inch, neither lips or limbs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
It's a recording, that's what it is
\shape default
.
 The thought sprung up inside his mind to the rescue of his sanity.
 Any hope of that being the truth was promptly shot down when he heard once
 more, in crystal clarity and with all the harmony and honey-laden softness
 of a fairy-tale trobadour:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Come now, Dan.
 I'm no recording.
 You're not crazy.
 At least, not right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan went wide-eyed and instinctively pushed the man in the mask.
 His hands went right through where his torso might have been.
 A second, flurried attempt at the man's head was equally, if not more so,
 disturbing.
 A moment of freezing terror was quickly followed by the last chance of
 a human mind to comprehend; a hologram.
 Maybe this was all weird and fucked up, but it was still, just a hologram.
 And that voice? That voice's just-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
That is the voice of the Origami.
 I'm real, Dan.
 As real as it gets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the entire house shone brilliantly and suddenly without a flash,
 as if it had been so all along; like an impossible cover was pulled aside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What Dan saw, or at least hoped he thought he was seeing in some drug-induced
 haze, or some virtual hypnoprojection, drove him almost past the edge of
 sanity into a nightmarish land he had never thought the mind was capable
 of dreaming up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw the man in the mask, wearing Mr.
 Kurawa's tweed clothes, his veined and wrinkled old hands crossing each
 other, palms facing opposite walls.
 And on each wall, the heads of the children.
 Pale, lacking expression, as if sleeping solemnly.
 Trails of dark blood ran down the white walls like withered, bony branches
 of dead trees.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flow of blood led to the small-framed bodies of the children still in
 their school uniforms; dismembered, broken, cut up like disused dolls.
 They had been gutted, their entrails laid out in a straight line.
 Like spokes in a wheel, they led to a bloody mess of a pile in the very
 center of the room.
 A pile of hearts, still beating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His would've pulled his own eyes out if he wasn't frozen still in sheer,
 unthinkable horror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shock made Dan release his bowels involuntarily.
 The man in the mask threw his head backwards in a fit of audible laughter.
 Dan was trembling visibly, but somehow his knees didn't give way.
 His spine felt chilled to the bone, and all colour had left his face.
 He looked more like a corpse than a man.
 His mind raced with just one crude, repetitive thought:

 head, but with Mr.

\begin_layout Standard
Dan's heart was near stopping, while his instinct of fleeing had chipped
 away like frail paint in stormy wind.
 He sat frozen, limp and unable to do anything else other than breathe in
 a shallow fashion.
 Cold perspiration ran down his forehead and back, but he didn't register
 it.
 Kurawa, or whatever it was that called itself the Origami, went on:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man's mask smiled in a deathly grin, revealing two sets of kid's teeth,
 half-formed and somewhat crooked, as if someone had strung them together
 in a necklace.
 Dan bent slightly forward and retched.
 The spasms and the cramped stomach muscles connected him to the sick reality
 around him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was looking at his feet, a small pool of vomit like a blotch of ink staining
 the old wooden floor.
 That was his bloodied vomit on the floor, but it didn't look like blood
 at all.
 It was a pitch black ooze, sticky like tar, its surface shining with a
 glistening iridiscence like oil.
 Dan didn't feel as shocked as before.
 Instead, he spent a few moments simply gazing at what had come out of his
 stomach.
 He felt curious, whereas he knew he should've felt deathly sick, or gone
 instantly mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought of a species of sand-lizard that could voluntarily stop its
 heart came uninvited to his mind; a part of him wished he could do that
 just now.
 Another part of him felt intrigued that he would be contemplating suicide,

\shape italic
That's not me

\shape italic
Oh, but it is you.
 It's the new you, my son
\shape default

 That voice in his mind again; only much more different.
 Radiant warmth seemed to embrace every word.
 A feeling of knowing that voice came to settle in his mind.
 It was someone he knew, someonw he trusted.
 Someone he loved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His body slackened, and he fell on his knees with a thud.
 The Origami stepped aside almost on cue, as if ushering Dan inside a holy
 house.
 Tears ran down Dan's chin, as the pile of hearts began to pulsate with
 a sickening violet light.
 The Origami began chanting on the top of his lungs, in a strange language
 full of vowels and throat sounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pile of hearts turned into a mass of flesh, the aortas turning into
 gaping mouths for just moments, tissue folding inside out and fusing together,
 as if trying to remember.
 Remember a shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chanting grew louder; it was because Dan was chanting along.
 His mouth moved of its own volition, spewing forth nonsense that somehow
 meant something to him.
 It was madness, he knew; a fleeting part of his sane mind told him so in
 writhing agony.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was pure madness; with any luck, none of it had happened: He was still
 in that veteran's hospital, plugged in a nightmare of his own creation,
 a tailored poisonous concoction running through his veins.
 He'd done that before, he might've done it again.
 He might've just imagined being released, and all the years in between.
 Just as long as this wasn't happening, as this wasn't real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
It's real, my son.
 All this, and the last war.
 The draught and the famine, the killings and the plague that followed.
 You, in that deep, fathomless basement.
 Trying to find a way to cure humanity of all its ills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiments? How did the voice know? The chanting buzzed through his
 head like a power-drill right on his eardrum.
 He couldn't think, he just chanted along with an alien fervor he had never
 thought himself capable of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was as if he had been locked outside his own mind and someone had thrown
 away the keys, small glimpses of the past and the present mingled together,
 seen through a red-misted slit.
 In front of him, the mass of flesh took further shape; muscles and formed
 into back-jointed legs, the bulbous mass in the center slowly but clearly
 extending two fibrous webs.
 Wings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The voice in his mind came as a welcome, soothing sensation.
 Its absence, Dan could now tell, hurt with each passing moment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
You're old self is fading away, yet you still do not recognise me.
 You cling on to your genetic past, while I offer your kind immortality
 past the flesh.
 It matters no more, Dan.
 Humanity will be no more, but it is saved.
 Such a small price, really.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Origami began dancing in a swirling pattern around the bodies of the
 children.
 He swayed his hands this way and that, the mockery of a graceful ballerina;
 a devilish clown in a mask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Echoes from the walls magnified the rhythmic chanting, reverberating, repeating
 and adding to the sound like hundreds of majestic voices singing at the
 wall between this world and the other, wishing for it to crumble down forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dan had a sudden revelation; what little remained of his own self in that
 body knew know who that voice was.
 As the mass of flesh took the form of a winged demon, a monstrous dragon-like
 head appeared, eerily familiar.
 It was grinning impossibly wide, as if its face barely held together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shimaki Kensaku.
 It was him; he couldn't tell why or how he knew, but it was really him.
 Even after death, it was him.
 Just when the demon was fully formed in the flesh, the chanting stopped
 abruptly and the light in the room was extinguished as if the flame on
 a candle had been suddenly blown.
 In the darkness, Dan heard the deep voice of his lost friend and esteemed
 colleague, Shimaki Kensaku.
 It had a serrated quality about it, like a saw grinding on stone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It was just a name.
 Good as any, Dan.
 Remember the acceptance speech at the Swedish Academy? It was all lies

 But it did.

\begin_layout Standard
For a precious few moments, Dan felt himself regain control of his body.
 He instinctively felt like running, running harder and faster than ever
 before.
 But it wouldn't do, he knew it didn't matter.
 He remembered the joy and awesome marvel that had been finding the mythical
 elixir of life - relieving humankind of the Primordial Sin.
 A new society, a bright, unending future.
 Then he remembered Kensaku's death; a gleaming fireball in the clear Parisian
 night.
 A suborbital reentry accident.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wept then; not because of the memories, or the tragic truth that was
 revealed in front of him in such a horrific way.
 Because of what that implied for their work - for the species.
 How else did Shimaki exhibit that intuitive grasp of cell mechanics? Those
 papers on mitochondrial regeneration, free root consolidation, flexible
 protein assembly and energy-free transcriptions?

Like they had been handed down from up above, almost overnight, the two

 intensity.
 Dan's head was throbbing from the pain; he knew he just had a few more
 moments before his personality was utterly discarded, erased like a blackboard.
 His last words, he found them quite fitting:
