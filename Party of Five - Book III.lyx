\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a sinister threat lurking in the cosmos.
 It is dark, sticky as tar and far worse than moldy cheese.
 It reaches in places you would never believe or feel comfortable with;
 its livid tendrils are sneakily out to get everything that's fair and beautiful
 around us, even unicorns.
 I must do as my conscience bids me; I must fight to expose their ill-doings
 and bring them down once and for all.
 There's a lot of danger involved which means I'll probably die or go mad
 in the process.
 But I have to do this, for the sake of my children alone.
 And perhaps all the things I find dear in the world, like Taem berries.
 And roast veeb.
 Perhaps, Rovenii mead and Yule beer as well.
 Just thinking about what is at stake here, makes me ravenous.

\begin_layout Quotation
-- Athmoor Radaniel, from his personal journal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea felt her face set against something wet and grainy.
 As if caught in the moment between wakefulness and sleep, her mind felt
 numb, soft and muddy.
 A word popped in her head: 
\shape italic
Sand
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Wet sand
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her face was half-buried in a patch of wet sand.
 There was a feeling of cold water splashing against her body every now
 and then.
 Maybe it was time to go to the latrine, she thought to herself, but she
 quickly realised it was the feeling of waves embracing her gently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
A beach then
\shape default
, she came to realise and opened her eyes half-expecting everything to be
 a dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no silken bedding around her, no morning sun's glory behind laced
 curtains; just a misty, fog-laden beach with low, crumbled rock outcroppings
 in the hazy distance, which really wasn't much of a distance at all.
 The sun lay hidden behind a grim overcast sky, dull and undignified.
 Lazy grey clouds barely seemed to move; a harsh, cold, salty breeze made
 her face flush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw the white bunny rabbit to her right, the way her head lay; Bo was
 munching on a small brush of salt-weed when she looked her way as if enabled
 by some sixth, or perhaps even a seventh sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good, you're awake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words rang crystal clear in Lernea's head; she was instantly confused.
 It was a woman's voice, warm and cheerful.
 Her first thought was she had either bumped her head somewhere along the
 way or had gone mad.
 Voices in her head were more than she could cope with - it was indeed the
 worst time to check her sanity levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's alright.
 It's me, Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said while Bo munched away, seemingly possessed by a real appetite
 for destroying salt-weed bushes.
 Lernea squinted at the bunny with a puzzled, weary look.
 For all she knew and cared for, a talking bunny made as much sense as a
 magical, fire-spouting one.
 What felt weird was that Bo sounded to her like a female.
 That didn't register as a life-threatening situation, Lernea knew; she'd
 just come out of one alive and well.
 
\shape italic
And quite wet
\shape default
, she added in her mind as an afterthought.
 She sighed and suddenly wished for a steamy hot cup of chamoleon: she could
 almost smell it too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised her head slightly above the wet sand and felt a sudden, awful
 dizziness.
 She remembered the drop into that churning nightmarish void fire and the
 flash; a bright, blinding flash.
 She remembered Theo falling right behind her, clasping her hand and Bo's
 eyes flaring up as as if the small white bunny was about to explode with
 a hail of brimstone and fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She dug her hands in the sand and propped herself up; her shoulders felt
 sore.
 She looked to her left and saw Theo laying there, his back against a patch
 of damp sand with arms splayed and eyes closed, where the waves would barely
 lick his body.
 Her mind flashed with a horrifying thought; she felt her stomach tie itself
 in a knot.
 
\shape italic
His hair looks dreadful
\shape default
, she thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's just sleeping.
 He was actually snoring a little while back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can read minds now as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea audibly, with just the right amount of annoyance in her
 voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, but it's not that hard to tell what must've crossed your mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo replied in her thoughts and dug her rabbit body under a rocky ledge
 where the wind seemed to die down, and sat there snugly.
 Lernea replied with an annoyed stare and a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She drove a hand through her hair reflexively; it was all a ragged mess,
 pieces of seaweed clinging on like little green, mushy braids.
 Her leather bodice was soaking wet and her boots made squishy, childish
 sounds.
 She felt wet and miserable, her only measure of relief the reassuring weight
 of her bow still strung against her back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aren't you cold? At all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked her timidly, her little bunny body shivering involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am the rightful Queen of Nomos, the Kingdom of the North,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied in a stern voice.
 She felt better just by saying that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, you're accustomed to this cold, I take it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know, Theo would need to ask something as obvious as that.
 Are you two related, by chance?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked as she took the bow off her back and began to run its curve
 with a hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actually, Theo is my brother,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and in Lernea's mind, the voice carried an awkward feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised an eyebrow and took a long, hard stare at Bo.
 Then she shook her head and looked at Theo; a silver-haired head with just
 a touch of blond, the wet, ragged dreadlocks adorning his elven face with
 all the grace of a mop.
 She burst out laughing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're funny! You're better than Ned!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and the bunny replied in her head flatly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm serious.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo's words nearly made Lernea's mind feel a bit heavier with all the weight
 the voice carried suddenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea blinked furiously as if something had been caught in her eye.
 Her face became taut suddenly; she stared back at the sea like a castaway
 waiting for a ship that'd never sail by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned.
 And Parcifal.
 They're not here, are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and walked over to Theo, vague footprints from her boots trailing
 behind her on the impressionable sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Neither is Winceham,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent.
 Lernea shot her a frowned look and paused mid-stride.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The weird, short fellow.
 Don't you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked with a hint of worry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin, really.
 I remember.
 I'm not really sure what exactly happened, that's all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat down beside Theo, legs crossed.
 Locks of her hair were glued against her face.
 She looked to windward, her arms laid back against the sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want the short version, or the long version?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo queried in Lernea's mind.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wager we're not in a hurry.
 If someone wanted us dead, they'd have done it by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shouldn't we wake Theo up as well? He might want to hear all this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added as an afterthought.
 Bo twitched her nose and hopped towards the sea, soaking her bunny feet
 in some wet, gravelly sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He gets a bit antsy if you wake him up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said in Lernea's mind, cautiously.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's kind of groggy and slow-minded for a while afterwards as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added and backed away playfully from a slightly frothing wave.
 Bo seemed to be having some kind of fun, despite it all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For a while? Like what, till the sun sets and the moon rises?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a sneer.
 Bo turned her bunny head uncannily towards Lernea; her eyes seemed to brighten
 up, if only just a little - it was a reflex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, that's not nice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she sent to Lernea's mind.
 There was some sadness involved, rather than anger.
 Lernea looked at Bo for a moment and closed her eyes.
 Right beside her, Theo could be heard, snoring lightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean it to sound like that.
 My apologies,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and awkwardly ran a finger in the sand, drawing random curves
 and shapes.
 Bo seemed satisfied; the bunny's eyes lost their glint and she turned to
 look at the undulating sea once more, her head bobbing slightly as if mesmerize
d by the waves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's true though, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said after a while.
 The bunny looked at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he can be a little daft sometimes.
 But he did save us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and hopped merrily towards Theo and snuggled right beside his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He did? I thought that was your doing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied, genuinely surprised to hear that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried, but there wasn't much I could do other than put a shield around
 us.
 The wormhole that brought us her in the nick of time, that was Theo, not
 me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and a little bit of pride had seeped into the thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a while, Lernea stared at Theo as if in shock.
 The sound of waves dying a few feet away rose easily above the eerie silence.
 Bo blinked at Lernea without saying a word.
 Overhead, a sea bird of some kind croaked.
 It drew Lernea's stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was quite inept at all things magical, especially for a sorcerer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, whatever he did, trust me, it wasn't magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and wiggled her nose.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo is magically inert.
 Has been ever since I can remember,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the bunny said and dug its face in Theo's sand-ridden dreadlocks, before
 pulling it out again sharply - as if some unruly smell assaulted her nostrils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was a sorcerer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

At least he seemed to perform like one; well, kind of.
 Sometimes, at any rate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added with a shrug, sounding clearly confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 I just made it appear so; I'm the sorceress in the family,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and her bunny eyes flared up with a tinge of red flame that was
 snuffed out the next instant, just to illustrate her point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just for appearance's sake?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked.
 Bo leapt above Theo's slowly rising and falling chest and perched herself
 on top of a mass of rocks.
 She stood straight up and looked around, surveying the misty landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin that raised us knew.
 I have a soft spot for Theo, what can I say? I thought it was a prudent
 thing to do.
 Magical bunnies aren't a dime a dozen - if word got out...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo let the words echo faintly in Lernea's mind.
 She gave Bo a weird, squinting look; it was her calculating, thinking look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're both in hiding, aren't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's right.
 Have been for years,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent with a feeling of relief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

From who? Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and put her bow down on the sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have no idea.
 I only have the words of my father, ringing in my head,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to Lernea and paused, sniffing the air.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hide.
 That's all I can remember.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I can relate to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a shallow voice.
 Her face became taut, remembering how she and Parcifal were cast out, humiliate
d, to be excised from living memory, from history even.
 As if they never had existed.
 She bit her lip and her mind turned to the quandary at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then how did he manage to pull off whatever it was he did that saved us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked and nodded at Theo's snoring form, looking baffled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The wormhole? I haven't got the slightest idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to Lernea's mind and uncannily shook her head slowly like a human
 would.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Same goes about the place we've ended up at,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, her nose twitching faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It could've been worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and stood up.
 A cold breeze snapped against her hard, lean face.
 She felt invigorated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We could have been charred to the bone or flash-steamed into space, that's
 true,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and began scouring the sand and rocks for signs of moss or something
 generally green and preferably edible.
 She sniffed profusely, like only some kind of herbivorous hound would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, this place could have been worse.
 Far worse.
 It however kind of feels...
 Homely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said after pausing for a moment, searching for the right word.
 She cleaned a bit of the sand off her pants, but the majority of the grains
 mostly clung on heedless.
 Bo's eyes widened and she turned her bunny head around at an impossible
 angle; anyone passing by would have been horrified by the unnatural movement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's homely about this cold, wet place? I can barely see what's out there.
 And as far as I can tell, there's nothing but rocks \SpecialChar \-
 not even a tint of
 moss.
 The sun is hidden \SpecialChar \-
 there is no way to tell the time.
 It's moody and grey, suggestive of a rainy afternoon without the rain.
 It's \SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kind of like home, indeed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This place reminds you of home?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked Lernea, the thought echoing with a positively glum quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Reminds me of Thraka; the northwestern reaches.
 My sister and I spent a whole summer there when we were kids.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Must've been a lovely summer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent, the sarcasm lost to Lernea.
 She dug instinctively in a shadowy cleft where \SpecialChar \-
 lo and behold \SpecialChar \-
 a cluster
 of mushrooms lay.
 She began nibbling at them after barely affording them a peremptory look.
 They didn't seem poisonous, and anyone hungry enough would have arrived
 at the same conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was; we went whale fishing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied with a thin smile.
 Bo was focused on the mushrooms, making sure to eat just the caps; she
 never did like the stems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was being sarcastic,but never mind.
 Whale fishing, you say? Just how old were you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Twelve,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said, nodding slightly to herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What kind of kids go whale hunting?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We were rarely, if ever, normal kids, even by Nomos standards.
 We were born to become queens, mind you,

 She was frowning once more, her mind seeking refuge in sweet memories past.

Lernea nodded and then frowned scornfully.
 A lady, even in the guise of an animal, that admitted to making vulgar

 She was about to begin lecturing Bo when a noise was heard, very much like
 someone sneezing at a quarter of the speed but ten times as loud.

 Bo sent, not feeling entirely sure.

A ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied and put a hand above her eyes, searching for a sail, a mast,
 a bow, or the smell of cider and mead.
 The creaking grew louder; it was as if the ship was riding past them.
 Theo's light snoring could not have hoped to match it.

 Lernea said and stuck out both of her arms in frustration, wild-eyed and

\begin_layout Standard
Then a giant shadow carved itself through the mist with alarming speed.
 A dark wooden bulk in the shape of a ship's prow appeared, accompanied
 by a creaking noise and the sound of foaming, rustling water.

Move!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo managed to sent with a gasping thought to Lernea and Theo both, while
 the ship ran aground heedlessly, kicking up wet sand violently all around
 its prow.
 No-one had time to move, but nevertheless the ship came to a jarring, abrupt
 halt with a grinding noise reminiscent of millstones and sliding tomb doors.
 Nobody was hurt, but they nonetheless couldn't pry their eyes off the ship's
 prow; there was a bronze-and-marble statuette of a luscious half-gorgon,
 half-mermaid decorating it.
 It was voluptuously sculpted, sexually suggestive and quite terrible to
 behold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Who goes there?

 leather and skin.

You're not a mermaid, are ye?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said a scruffy-looking old man that suddenly appeared at the ship's railing.
 He was wearing what appeared to be more than a slightly used horned metal
 cap on his head and a tattered old shirt with matching pants of an indiscrimina
te nature and original color.
 A rather musky old beard hung from his face down to his waist; what looked
 like tiny barnacles clung on strands of it, as if their life depended on
 it, which was probably true.
 There was a wooden parrot that appeared to be physically and permanently
 attached to his shoulder.
 It was also quite emphatically dead, judging as it didn't breathe nor move
 on its own.

I was hoping a gentleman of your caliber and seamanship would be much more

 Lernea replied, to which the man strained his neck like a turtle and offered

Lernea sighed and let her shoulders sag.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you'd know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and waved a hand at the ship at large.
 The old man who quite closely resembled a rather out-of-luck, struggling
 old-timer pirate picked at his nose and flicked its output with a bony
 finger.

 he said and smiled showing an array of teeth in all their possible states

Lernea felt let down.
 She was hoping there'd be a silver lining in all that mess of a situation.
 Bo whispered in her mind, even if there was no real need to do so:

Don't tell him anything.
 Ask him everything.

\begin_layout Standard
There was a slight hint of paranoia right there; if the Ygg had reached
 out wherever this place was, Lernea thought to herself, their agents would've
 realised who they were talking to by now.
 More to the point, she reasoned, if that old geezer was working for the
 Ygg, they were indeed a sad, hopeless, desperate lot.

Mr.

 wary.

Where are the others? Why don't they show themselves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she sent to Lernea, in what resembled a hiss.
 She was trying to gnaw at her paws, but bunny physiology sadly made that

 Theo was still trying to get some sort of bearing with reality at large,
 sand running through his palms.

 Lernea said aloud to make sure the old pirate would hear her.
 He looked behind him for a moment, as if someone had tapped him on his
 shoulder, but there seemed to be no-one there.
 He nodded to himself, shrugged and said to no-one in particular:

 It splashed into the sea audibly with a plop, and lingered for a moment

 Parcifal replied icily.
 She was staring vacantly at the rosy-red sky.
 Thick, puffy clouds passed them by, while below them a green tapestry inched
 by.
 There were tiles of brown and gold in there too; farms and villages, the

 Roads and bridges, the roofs of houses, small and big.
 Big piles of manure and freshly grazed hillsides.

 Tark said trying to smile thinly, his words carefully selected and his
 voice pitched so as to get the message through in a nice yet slightly irritatin

 Parcifal did not bat an eyelid nor did she budge even by an inch.
 She simply spared Tark a fleeting glance, to serve as a warning.

 Ned interjected, seeing the first signs of a discussion evolving into a
 fight.
 And Ned knew there had been more than one on their way to Pi Gamma Mu,
 from what they could gather, a reasonably peaceful planet of the Human
 League.
 The fights usually involved Parcifal and Tark, and they were mostly resolved
 before anyone got physically hurt by either Ned or Judith acting as peacemakers.
 Winceham was either sleeping, having a smoke, or not having a bath most

 His decidedly neutral disposition had earned him a sort of invisible attribute

It is a matter of principle, Mr.

 he added and turned his back on everyone without another word.
 Parcifal remained silent, unperturbed.
 Her mind was fixated on what really mattered; the whereabouts and fate
 of her sister.
 She knew Lernea was alive, that much she felt as well.
 But where, and for how long, she couldn't answer.
 Those uncertainties gnawed at her soul; it do any good for her manners
 either.
 She was in a state of constant ire, angry at everything and everyone.
 What she wouldn't freely admit but knew it in her heart, was that she blamed
 herself, more than anything.
 After all, she was still a princess of Nomos, the Captain of the Guard.
 She had failed her queen, putting her in harm's way, failing to protect
 her.

Absorbed in thought, it took her a while to realise Judith was watching

 Parcifal's gaze did not follow her.

Ned was conversing with Tark in a low voice; Winceham was sitting comfortably
 at a swiveling, puffy chair, his feet resting at the helm proper.
 The helm moved and rocked as Winceham shuffled his legs, but the ship oddly,
 stayed on course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was because the helm, though operational, didn't really do much of
 the handling.
 The ship was an advanced design; among the many utilities and assorted
 paraphernalia, the mysterious thingamajigs and spurious artifacts it carried,
 it was equipped with an autothaumagator, a device that supposedly served
 many purposes, but whose primary function was to navigate the ship safely
 and without any crew assistance whatsoever.

 Tark said, smiled and nodded meaningfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I see.
 This Human League of yours, it doesn't sound like a particularly inviting

 If it wasn't for the predicament we've found ourselves in...

 Theo said and let his voice trail conspiratorially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The Tallyflop Incident,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark added, sounding drawn in to some other kind of conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Whatever you wish to call it, it was more than just an incident.
 The whole place nearly got consumed by that, what was it again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

A Thaumaturgic Event Displacement.
 A TED, we call it,

 Tark said just to get the technicalities out of the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you have a name for everything?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo wondered frankly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not for everything.
 But for everything that matters.
 That thing mattered a lot.
 It still does,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark reassured him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I have a feeling it really only matters to you.

The Ygg are growing stronger by the minute.
 They're a destabilizing force that needs to be dealt with,

 Tark said with a suddenly steely gaze.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I've seen the truth of that.
 But what is it to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo asked, his voice needlessly harsh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Human League has a vested interest in a number of worlds.
 It'd be foolish to have to deal with this later, while we can deal with
 this now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said, his face austere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I meant, what is it to you personally?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Theo insisted.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's my job, that's what it is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied with a deep-set frown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Just a job? Going through all this, just to do your job?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said smiling, and shook his head in disbelief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's called professionalism.
 I wouldn't expect you to understand,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark replied and looked away, a show of rejection.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why is that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Because you're amateurs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark replied scornfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You haven't seen me perform then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Theo said with some pride in his voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Perform what, exactly?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark inquired, sounding confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I do stand-up comedy and play the drums.
 I know it's an unusual mix for a bard, but I think it can have its own
 appeal.
 You know?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said casually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Maybe you really are good at that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and perhaps for the first time ever genuinely smiled.

\end_inset

How can you tell?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Wasn't that a joke? About the drums and all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark asked in all seriousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, not really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo replied counfounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, I wouldn't really know.
 I work for Naval Intelligence, after all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How are the two connected?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

It's an utterly drab, humorless job,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark replied and nodded to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Another reason I can't understand why you're doing it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said and shook his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because someone has to do it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and sounded like he genuinely believed that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But why does it have to be you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo asked and pointed a stabbing finger to Tark's chest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why not me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark asked garrulously and let the words sink in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That really doesn't make any sense,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said and threw his hands in the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's no sense in intelligence.
 Just gents,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and looked thoughtful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Was that supposed to be a witty play on words?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied after thinking about it for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought it was funny, anyway.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As far as I know, that's highly unlikely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said without the least bit of humor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judith approached them and nodded to Ned with a slight smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir, we're approaching Rampatur,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and stood there, apparently waiting for instructions.
 Tark nodded and his eyes scanned the horizon momentarily, before his eyes
 met the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the white towers and glistening prisms that made up the core of
 Rampatur City were growing closer.
 Like a miniature set built with extreme detail in mind, Rampatur City looked
 nearly perfect and almost fake.
 Yet it was real enough: stretching across both sides of pristine river,
 it was a sprawling metropolis graced with a distinctive meld of architecture
 from many different schools, representing nearly every world of the Human
 League.
 A large, tall pyramid-like structure dominated the center of the city,
 its marble-white and steel-grey impeccable surface glistening softly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned sat there wide-eyed, wonderfully fascinated at the rich white, grey
 and golden hues reflecting the mellow green and brown countryside surrounding
 the city.
 He was transfixed; he couldn't stop staring, his lips curled in a grin.
 The sight of the approaching city even managed to attract Parcifal's parsimonio
us stare, but she didn't break her silence.
 She simply stood there, unable to contain the fact that her interest was
 indeed piqued.
 Ned, on the other hand sounded openly ecstatic: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What a sight! It's so grandiose.
 So majestic!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just a backwater planet's capital.
 It's quite rustic, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, scoffing.
 He then turned and faced the helm abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ship, send a hail message to the Directorate Office.
 Be sure to include the word `pumpkin', capitalized.
 Negotiate a mooring with Rampatur Aerial and bring us in for landing.
 What was that nice place on Rampatur Central?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

An index of three hundred and nineteen topographical entities in the vicinity

 Tark said with some mild annoyance.

Stimulate,

 the ship repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never mind.
 Find an exorbitantly-priced restaurant.
 Book a table for five.
 Make sure to ask for privacy.
 And put it on the expenses list,

\end_inset

 Tark said raising a finger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thaumaturgizing your request,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 voiced the ship in mellifluous tones.
 Tark turned to face Ned once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Excellent.
 We'll be landing shortly, Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You made dinner reservations?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked him.
 Tark stared at him for a moment before ceding an answer with a slightly
 confused look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark, his answer sounding a lot like a puzzling question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you reserved a table for five.
 Does that mean you're offering us a night out? Like a welcoming gift?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said smiling a bit awkwardly, always wearing a polite smile on his
 lips.
 He could see Parcifal fidgeting uncomfortably near the ship's prow, as
 if itching to get off the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Good gracious, no!

 Tark exclaimed with a polite little laugh.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would've been impertinent to say the least.
 Quite frankly, whatever gave you that idea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark was looking at Ned from head to toe; what Ned implied sounded almost
 absurd to Tark.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been in the field for months.
 I'm having a blast tonight.
 All sorts of debauchery in mind, if you must know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and made eyes at Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I wasn't asking for details, but what about us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned demanded with a sharp frown.

Judith will handle your lot.

What does that mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It means you need to co-operate and everything will be fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squinted as he gazed towards the city, a hand over his eyes.
 From the right point of view, the setting sun wasn't blinding but rather
 painted the round-topped towers with a rosy, pinkish sheen.
 Ned's answer came with a heavy, slow nod of his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll co-operate alright.
 Just as long as we're treated fair and proper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and made sure to stress the last word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What about her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and pointed at Parcifal, looking at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal is strong-willed and proud.
 She's like a hurt, caged animal right now.
 You never know when she might lash out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and shrugged.
 Tark took him by one shoulder and nearly whispered in his ear: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As a word of advice, don't act the fool with Intelligence.
 You're not Human League citizens; you'll only be granted a provisional
 status upon landing.
 And that halfuin friend of yours, he'll be in trouble.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

How do you mean? What kind of trouble?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said, sounding alarmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see he's humanoid, not human standard.
 He will be considered an illegal alien,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised an eyebrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Winceham? He might be old and smell bad because he never takes a bath, but
 he's not an alien!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not the official take on the matter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned slightly around to check on Parcifal.
 He noticed Judith was busy making last minute checks to her inventory,
 all neatly stacked and tied down to the deck.
 Ned's voice was filled with sudden angst: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why didn't you say so before?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It would have been pointless, really.
 There was no place to drop him off,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied with a smug little grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And now there is? Treating halfuins like aliens.
 Aren't there any short people in the Human League?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's an entirely different subject.
 I don't make policy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squatted, reaching for a metal box near the helm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're on the clock.
 I'm doing you a great favor just by letting you know.
 This could get me into a lot of trouble.
 Lose my job, get shot.
 I'm talking that kind of trouble,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sounded positively serious even though the grin would not disappear
 from his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You won't buy us dinner, but you're willing to risk getting shot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's not get all chummy all of a sudden,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised one finger with one hand while he rummaged inside
 the metal box with the other.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dinner is one thing; getting shot is a professional perk anyway.
 I like to think of this warning as extending a little bit of professional
 courtesy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, looking up to Ned with a smile.
 In his hands he held what looked like a small backpack or rather a large
 bag, riddled with straps and whatnot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I'm a performer.
 You're a...
 Spy, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked, a good measure of uncertainty lingering in his voice.
 To his knowledge, spies were vermin-like people, all cloak and dagger that
 you'd never guess in a million years what they did for a living.
 In this case, Tark was practically shouting out the fact from the tree
 tops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Things seldom are the way they appear to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and perfunctorily gave the bag a look all around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You're not a spy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo asked with disbelief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you seriously expecting me to answer that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said while wearing the bag on his back.
 It was black and somewhat rotund.
 A pair of red lines made of stitches ran its length; they were made in
 the shape of a lightning symbol.

 I'm not the one making up the names.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, what does it do?

 Ned asked, voicing some genuine interest in what appeared to be little

 Ned asked conversationally, and vaguely shrugged with a pondering finger

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Oh, there's no magic involved.
 It's a simple aetheric device.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

You mean like, involving aether science?

That's what the big-heads in VV-section told me, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark replied, fastening a pair of straps around his waist.
 Ned's gaze seemed drawn to the retardation device.
 After a couple of moments of scrutiny, Ned asked poignantly, one hand resting
 under his chin in a knuckle:
\end_layout

There's always religion, I'm told,

 Tark said and walked past Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned asked him with a tint of curiosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I need to jump,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and made a jumping gesture with both hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were coming along,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and took a few steps closer to Tark, hands crossed over his chest.
 He was pouting slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh, no.
 I'm not even supposed to be on this ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said, grinning profusely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

So, you're hiding as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hiding is a harsh term.
 Obfuscating one's whereabouts is much more preferable a phrase,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said smiling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It still means you're hiding.
 Winceham will be forced to go into hiding as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned commented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Look, I really need to jump.
 I'd hate to get skewered on a one of those towers if the wind changes all

 Tark said nodding down below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I need you to do me a favor,

 Ned said and touched Tark on the shoulder gently, smiling lightly.
 Tark noticed the gesture and sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is strictly business.
 Nothing personal to all of this, do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and turned his back on Ned.
 He grasped the railing and was preparing to actually jump overboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I wouldn't jump just yet if I were you,

 Ned said, tapping Tark's shoulder profusely.

Sweetness of a maiden's tit! What is it now?

 Tark asked, looking at the backpack's straps mundanely.

\begin_layout Standard

Misdirection, mostly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said as if it should have been obvious.
 Tark stepped away from the railing and took off the backpack.

 Ned asked him with a worrisome voice.

 Tark said and sighed, steadying himself as the ship tilted itself gracefully
 and began a slightly curved descend to Rampatur Central.

And all this time, Parcifal was still staring at the sun, wholly uninterested

The ship was the 
\shape italic
Mary Drunkard
\shape default
; a twelve-gun fast runner, light and deadly as a hawk when it was first
 put to sea.
 Three hundred and twenty three years later though, it was a small miracle
 or perhaps even a feat of magic that vessel still remained afloat.
 Anyone who could afford a bit of common sense would have bet an arm and
 a leg that a ship filled with gaping holes and made out of maggot-infested,
 rotten wood would happily sink to the bottom like a shapely rock.
 The few unlucky souls who made those kinds of bets gave a small bump in
 the always-in-demand, but never-really-breaking-it-big, prosthetics industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original owner, a rich eccentric drunkard that liked to spend his vast
 wealth in pointless exotic travels and self-inflicted adventures, had indeed
 named the ship in one of his drunken binges.
 If one were to judge by the way it teeter-tottered ungainly as it tried
 to navigate the unbudging fog, it was a very fitting name indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked skeptical, while Theo sported a withdrawn expression, thoughtful
 to the point of weariness.
 It had everything to do with the game-board he was glued to, its multi-colored
 tiles and numerous pieces too much for the untrained eye to handle.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What if...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea suggested at one point and inched a finger closer to one of the
 pieces.
 Theo stopped her in her tracks with a single, wild-eyed glance.
 She drew her hand back onto her lap where Bo sat, her bunny eyes going
 back and forth between Theo and the captain, as if a tiny spark was all
 that was needed to ignite a deadly silence into a veritable mayhem, even
 though all they were doing was sitting comfortably around a table, sipping
 some tea and playing Po.

 Theo said nibbling at one of his fingernails.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What kind of game would that be, lad?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Captain Van der Breckenrod asked with an abruptly aroused suspicion, holding
 his chin up; the pipe in his mouth followed suit and remained stuck upwards
 as it glowed, ember-red after he drew heavily on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Po,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Theo without skipping a beat or breaking his concentration.
 The Captain looked around him for a moment, then looked at the table and
 let the smoke out of his nostrils.
 A small cloud hovered between him and Theo before he finally rolled his
 eyes and as if waking from a dream, fluttered his eyelids and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course, Po!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo fidgeted in Lernea's lap; she couldn't sit still.
 She had been growing more and more nervous by the minute.
 She voiced to Lernea and Theo, for their minds alone to hear: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He suspects something.
 He knows.
 He's hatching a plan, we're in grave danger!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea tried to control her breathing; her face jerked slightly, involuntarily,
 as if something had bitten her.
 She picked up Bo and looked her in the eyes, those wonderful red-hued bunny
 eyes with the propensity to spout fiery wrath when provoked.
 Bo looked rather adorable in her fluffy white bunny form, and Lernea was
 a young woman of noble heart, scion to a kingdom and very lady-like, good
 and proper in her manners, just and swift with her bow.
 But she was an inch away from actually breaking the bunny's neck, and Bo
 could feel she was at the edge of a chasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's just say, for the sake of argument, you were afraid, for some reason
 \SpecialChar \-
 well-founded or not \SpecialChar \-
 that a particular set of events might occur in the
 future.
 Like taking an arrow to your knee that would prevent you from living the
 life of an adventurer.
 Or some stranger you just met was awfully weird and had really bad bladder
 control on top of a drinking problem that made you suspicious of him.
 That man would not constitute a let's say, clear and present danger against
 your person, without showing overt aggressiveness in the form of killing
 you outright, in your sleep, or at least trying to throw you overboard
 to the killer whales, now.
 In which case I would be more than happy to do something about it to the
 best of my ability.
 Seeing though, as there isn't any evidence to support such a claim, I would
 be remiss to not point out that going on and on about a hypothetical situation
 without any basis on reality \SpecialChar \-
 bent as it may be under certain circumstances
 \SpecialChar \-
 can drive a person mad.
 It would thus be, by any account, not unlikely for a person under duress
 to be driven into acts of temporary insanity as can be proven under law,
 to which extent said person might not be held liable for his actions and
 be set free, even after killing said person with the imaginary fears.
 Wouldn't you agree, overall, gentlemen?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said without tearing her eyes away from Bo who remained perfectly
 still, soaking in what was mostly intended for her ears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Captain Van der Breckenrod looked at Lernea sideways for a moment and then
 looked at the glass in his hand.
 There was a little tiny piece of handicraft floating in it, an umbrella
 \SpecialChar \-
 or some would argue, a parasol \SpecialChar \-
 and it was slowly sinking in the dark,
 cherry red mixture of unidentifiable alcohol and rum.
 He downed the glass in one go, frowned heavily for a while, checked the
 bottom of the glass for signs of more liquor and then looked at her and
 told Lernea, the tiny umbrella still stuck on his beard:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I, for one, Miss Testarossa, am agreed.
 I am quite agreeable a person, after all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and threw away the tiny umbrella with the intention of sending
 it overboard.
 Instead, it somehow stopped in the air and flew around in circles and settled
 on Theo's hair, who was too preoccupied with planning his next move to
 afford the most perfunctory of looks.
 He did nod though, but only to himself in relation to a possible move he
 was contemplating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's quite alright, Mr.
 Van der Breckenrod.
 Silence is after all, a common indicator of approval.
 Isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and Bo seemed to nod imperceptibly.
 She remained silent indeed, and almost managed to look prudish somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, if my crew is any indication, you are spot on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the old pirate said and raised his glass.
 It was pretty soon floating mid-air in the direction of the ramshackle
 captain's cabin.
 Lernea had noticed a lot of that was going on around the ship; sails hoisting
 themselves, ropes being tied up as if by way of magic, giant waterproof
 holes in the hull.
 Yet it had nothing to do with magic, or else Bo would have at least found
 a real possible threat to take into account.
 It had something to do with ghosts and Theo was the only one who could
 see them, but talk to them as well.
 It was all about Rho, the ever-present life force of sorts that exists
 in everything living, according to what Theo had been taught.
 Somehow, that even involved the undead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still, a skeleton crew; no pun intended.
 How do you manage?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked and put Bo down on the deck.
 Her voice was weary, but noticeably calm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the captain said while scanning the board of Po with a squinted gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, it's just you and what was it, three ghosts?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and Theo nodded reassuringly to her.
 He had made his move and thus was now aware of what it was that Lernea
 was talking about.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You've been lost at sea for fifteen years.
 Don't you find it, taxing? I mean, isn't there a home you'd like to get

Ah.
 I've turned the sea into my wife and mistress; this ship is my home, and

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the captain said nodding to himself.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sometimes though, I do wake up and see what's for breakfast and I wish I
 were dead, yes.
 But then I'm reminded I might end up as ghost crew in a ghost ship and
 I just know the kind of heartless bastards that run those ships,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and gave the main mast an angry, crazed stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That brings me back to my senses,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and took a swig from his pipe before moving a pawn shaped like
 an extravagantly built windmill to a blue tile on the Po board.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and reshuffled himself in his seat.
 He was rather more quiet and thoughtful than his usual self.
 He hadn't raised many questions since he had woken up, and he had made
 no mention of Tejwel, the bear involved in whatever that thing they blew
 up in Tallyflop was.
 Theo must've thought him a real friend indeed though, judging by the way
 he so easily and quite impressively killed the Ygg as if they were nothing
 more than monstrous dolls at play.
 It had certainly had some effect on him; he sometimes appeared grim and
 boring, all grown-up.
 Even the game they had been playing seemed utterly drab, and he seemed
 to be enthralled in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is it that's interesting exactly? I haven't heard of this game before.
 All I see is a mosaic of tiles painted on an irregularly shaped board,
 and lots of different pieces made out of all sorts of things.
 Not to mention you've been playing for four hours straight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat up straight in the utilitarian stool.
 She produced a comb out of a small pocket of her vest, and began combing
 her hair.
 Apart from not doing much to rectify the sad affair that her hair had been
 reduced to, the combing had the deleterious effect of grains of sand falling
 onto the game-board with a rasping, cluttering sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could you do that someplace else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said while the captain extended a hand blindly to receive his flying,
 refilled glass of the cocktail he was drinking, complete with a tiny umbrella
 and everything, up to and including a slice of pineapple.
 Lernea looked at Theo and noticed his stare wasn't the usual bland-eyed
 stare he seemed to confront the world at large with; it had a purpose and
 a hint of ire this time.
 She stopped combing her hair and apologized, though she hadn't expected
 anyone to notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the captain roared, and Theo nodded, intently fixed on the game-board.

You do realize games are simulations, don't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the captain said, and the dead stuffed parrot hanging onto his shoulder
 seemed to nod the way the old pirate made a vibrant gesture with his hands,
 roughly shaping up a sphere in the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought games were supposed to be fun,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was looking at the pirate intently, ears standing
 tall and upright like antennae.
 Though she remained silent, Lernea felt she was ready to absorb everything
 the captain was saying.
 Theo, on the other hand, was looking at the game-board with a heavy frown,
 too absorbed in planning his strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They have to be fun, so people will want to play them.
 Do keep in mind, people's idea of fun differs greatly.
 For instance, Mr.

 to throw away all the navigating equipment.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea nodded with a frown, while the captain let the barbed comment sink
 in.
 After seemingly observing a moment of silence, the captain spoke again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're not having that discussion, again, Mr.
 Gunnadeer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said flatly and drew on the pipe.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see, Ms.
 Testarossa, fun and games can be quite productive past-times.
 The risk-taking, the strategy involved, the planning, the logistics of
 the thing, your opponent and his idea of you, your idea of him...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and straightened the dead parrot on his shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that's detailed enough, it's like war and all that fighting that goes
 on and on everywhere.
 But if you play it out first, in something as innocuous looking as this
 little board of Po, it might show you an advantageous situation, a way
 out of trouble or a way into it.
 You might learn a winning strategy, or the cost of defeat.
 It's more of a tool, Po.
 It has the added benefit it's pretty hard to injure yourself with.
 Unlike sword-fighting and full-scale war.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So in essence, it's like Zatrik,

 Lernea said nodding.
 Both the captain and Theo were instantly adamant in their rebuttal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 they said in one voice and glowered at her for a moment.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No need to get excited.
 I'll take your word for it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was nowhere to be seen.
 Which was quite unsettling knowing she could flame her eyes up in a split
 second and start fire-balling everything for no apparent reason.
 Adding her latest streak of paranoia did not help either.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's good to know you're keeping tabs,

 Lernea said and went off to find Bo.
 Perhaps she just wanted to converse with Lernea in a slightly more secluded
 spot - the ship offered plenty of those.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not doing that; I'm playing Po,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said long after Lernea had left the table.
 Stringing words together rather than someone talking, his eyebrows raised
 in a wide arch, the captain asked Theo:

Whose turn is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Well even if it is, I don't care, because...

 Theo said and looked around him, the tiny umbrella still stuck in his dreadlock
s.
 The fog was clearing up; the first purely golden rays of sun shafted through
 from above.
 It was as if someone had delineated an invisible line on some grandiose
 map, where one side was all grey and bland and the other side was shiny,
 green and sported cute depictions of butterflies and cupids.
 It looked like the ship had just passed it and emerged on the fancy, nice
 side of the map.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So, it worked,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo sent to Lernea's mind happily.
 She was standing precariously on the ship's prow, like a living figurehead,
 eyes slightly glowing orange, not unlike tiny beacons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Lernea said with a wide, appreciative smile.

\begin_layout Standard

Not much, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo sent to Lernea's mind with a sigh.
 It seemed like the perfect answer to Lernea for a moment; her mind was
 indeed elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her gaze wandered up and down the coastline that unfurled itself graciously.
 The sun was almost noon-high, shining with all its might.
 Its warmth was a pleasant contrast to the fresh, icy breeze; they were
 still someplace cold but at least there was warmth to be found in the daylight.
 At the farthest reaches, Lernea could still make out large rocky cliffs
 and islets.
 A spatter of snow and ice hugged their topsides.
 But the way the ship was pointed, they were sailing straight for a small
 bay, surrounded by golden-brown thickets.
 In the distance beyond, a hilly terrain formed, slightly sloping into a
 grey phantom vision of a mountain ridge.
 What was more telling, she could see thin columns of smoke rising up from
 the bay.

 she said and helped up Bo like one would a furry trophy or a lovable pet.
 She restrained herself from squeezing in a damaging way.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

 Bo sent and Lernea put the bunny down on the deck again.

The walls of the Marvelously Rotund and Equivocally Reassuring Grandiose
 Officious Hall of Endearment were basically rotund and ostensibly too large
 for the common eye to perceive fully.
 Yet it was simply one of many similar halls \SpecialChar \-
 if not in name certainly in
 capacity \SpecialChar \-
 dotted around the Naval Intelligence Bureau building in Rampatur
 City, itself one of many government buildings of varied shape and uniformly
 huge size to be found in the very center of the city.
 From the outside, the Naval Intelligence building looked like an even,
 totally opaque block of granite from which a huge flag of the Human League
 was unfurled, drooping over the north face, above the diminutive revolving
 door entrance.
 It was identical to any other government building and no-one in Rampatur
 seemed to pay it the least amount of notice, even if everything it shadowed
 was made cooler.
 As in, the temperature dropped because of the huge shadow it cast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hall boasted some soft lighting in the form of a couple of hidden spotlights
 of dubious nature; Ned, Tark, Judith and Parcifal were standing under guard.
 Four men in full body armor, boasting elaborately ornate halberds that
 sported some sort of exotic machinery on them were keeping an eye on all
 of them.
 The ridiculously colored suit came with a number of silly-looking hats
 being worn one on top of another, as well as any number of a variety of
 feathers adorning them.
 There were also a number of medals and bones hanging from the guards' breastpla
te armor.
 If anything at all, they looked like some sort of very state-of-the-art
 laughable jokers armed with nonetheless sharp, really bleeding-edge, instrument
s of death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood emotionless, her face stuck in a cold, calculating gaze.
 Ned was wary; he felt the whole situation was akin to a very tight balancing
 rope act, without a safety net, with razor sharp spikes waiting on either
 side of the definitely terminal drop.
 Tark was looking smug and confident in a very stylish, simple yet exotic
 suit of black cloth with matching smart pants and soft, spongy shoulder
 pads that made him look pretty suave.
 Judith was looking worn out, red-eyed, fidgeting in her tight leather suit.
\end_layout

In front of them, at what was probably judged to be a safe but not too impractic
al distance sat the Impromptu Intelligent Committee on Matters of Intelligence

 There was even a wooden sign carved with those exact words sitting on a
 bleak, wooden desk where the members of the Committee rested their crossed
 hands.
 They were all dressed in nondescript white robes.
 Only the older man among them wore a fine-wrought silver chain around his
 neck from where a small curio hang.
 Their desk was filled with all manner of scrolls, maps, and papers which
 were being scrutinized seemingly at random.
 The sound of shuffling papers reverberated across the gigantic empty space
 of the hall which appeared to have, oddly enough, excellent acoustics.

 humbled and civil about everything.
 Ned on the other hand was wearing a giant frown: although he felt like

 Lady Govida said with a thoughtful look on her face.

Your report was vague.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked him.

Well it was huge, and made mostly of crystal.
 It was built with something bad in mind, that's for sure,

 Tark replied.
 Ned commented with evident sarcasm,

 his head bobbing up and down slightly.

 Parcifal said angrily, real emotion pouring out from her voice.

Calm down now, Lady Teletha.
 You're not mistaken; in the morning, we'll have to secure the funding and

 Lady Govida said flatly, before adding with a weighty measure of confidence,

 Judith said following a curt nod.

If you'll excuse us,

Well, that's actually a good idea.

 Ned offered.
 Parcifal shook her head reproachfully.

 Parcifal finally ceded with some reluctance in her voice.

And maybe Judith could bring a friend, if she'd like to.

They left the ghost ship with its skeleton crew in a nearby alcove, protected

 From then on the walk to the village was an easy, refreshing trip which

 Lernea offered thanks and praise to Svarna for guiding her home, and kissed
 the ground, quickly realizing the picture in her mind did not match the
 taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The salty breeze mingled with the smells of green grass and mushy, wet ground.
 It brought a heartfelt smile to Lernea's face to be back home, even under
 the very unusual circumstances.
 And it was a true wonder in itself that her mentor, friend and caretaker,
 the man who had been to her more than the grandfather she had never met,
 was alive and well, despite what she had thought she had seen with her
 very eyes.

Theo felt the cold climate bite through his linen robes.
 The southern seas were warm, and space had been generously temperate and
 comfortable when not threatening their lives.
 But the northern reaches of Nomos offered a cold, harsh climate, suitable
 for the hardy locals, but not so friendly to anyone else.
 Except Bo who was comfortably covered in fur and was quite excited at the
 prospect of munching on northern, exotic grass; brushes were rare and flowers
 even rarer, but they provided a challenge with interesting, mouth-filling
 rewards.
 She delightfully hopped along, sampling what freshness the outdoors of
 Nomos had to offer.

Lernea was decidedly not asking Sisyphus a lot of questions; she was content
 knowing that there was time enough to get up to date on matters of importance.
 And there were quite a lot of those, Master Sisyphus had told her, but
 his philosophy was that the slow, careful approach, always offered more
 time to think and analyze things through.
 That way of thinking, in turn, offered more choices of action, and considerably
 more ways of egress out of nasty situations.
 Which was exactly the manner he had \SpecialChar \-

 clever planning \SpecialChar \-

You'd be surprised how much heat the body generates.

 Sisyphus said nodding.

You can tell me all about it when we rest properly.

 Sisyphus commented grumpily.

I'm afraid what stories I have to tell are in the same vein as well, Master.

Winceham? That's an interesting name.

 mused Master Sisyphus.
 Lernea added with a soft voice:
\end_layout

Parcifal is with them.
 Only Svarna knows where they are now.
 At least, I think they're safe.
 Last I saw them, they were flying away in a ship, trying to flee a terrible

I was referring to the Teletha sisters,

 Master Sisyphus said, eying Theo with a powerful frown that made the elf

Is he really a sorcerer?

 Theo said with what amounted to a lopsided grin.

 he whispered while the villager made a motion with his head and asked in

As it is the norm these days, secrecy, deceit and counterfeit is essential

The Jangdrivals are a plight to the people; they've tripled the amount of
 labor levy and have placed a firm grip on free trade and the crafts.

\begin_layout Standard
The moment she stepped into the house, the smell of roast fish assaulted
 her nostrils, and she felt a pinching on her neck.
 Then another one, and another one in quick succession.
 Her head started spinning and she became oddly aware that the house was
 being lifted into the sky, as if it was made out of gum.
 In fact, she slumped onto the floor with a strange smile on her face and
 lay there, peacefully unconscious.

Sisyphus calmly appeared through the door, stepping over Lernea casually.

 Is this some kind of custom?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he inquired, and a double-shot of tiny globes of fire flew right past his
 hair, singing it slightly, to strike at patches of darkness at the roof.
 Cries of agony were heard before the reassuring thud of bodies hitting
 the floor.
 Bo appeared through the door, eyes flaring, ears pointed straight up, ready

 Sisyphus made a hand gesture to the bunny.
 Bo raised her head and looked at him in an uncannily human fashion.

 After they'd met for dinner, he was loathe to disclose details of his exact
 whereabouts, but he very eagerly went on to consume copious amounts of

 As such, it was no wonder he was grumpy, feeling sick with a splitting
 headache and itching for a smoke, a small luxury that was denied to him
 until after the vote was cast.

Winceham toyed with his empty pipe wearing a sour expression on his face.
 Next to him sat Parcifal; her silent manner and grim face afforded her
 an awe-inspiring, deadly-looking gaze.
 Her eyes scanned the auditorium piecemeal, looking for danger without success.
 Her gaze though did lock on to the form of the Council members, once they
 entered the auditorium's stage: they were dressed in elaborate, ornate,
 red and black robes, wearing plush velvet hats that looked like furry bloated
 versions of dead skunk-like creatures, strangely colored but thankfully
 odorless.
 They looked rather silly to everyone except for the crowd in the auditorium;
 the noise died down to a few careless whispers suddenly.
 Ned turned his head and asked Judith in a whisper:

 Parcifal hissed suddenly and her eyes met with Ned's in a strange, awkwardly
 cold fashion.
 She was evidently upset; she hadn't been herself ever since Lernea had
 been drawn in that cataclysmic hole, possibly to become lost forever.
 They knew Lernea, Theo and Bo were alive, but where they had ended up was
 beyond them.
 There was little they could do, and there were more pressing issues at
 hand; their home planet was in danger and this was their chance to make
 a whole lot of difference.
 It was disconcerting for Ned though not to be able to read through Parcifal's
 opaqueness; he didn't know whether she was so tightened up because she
 might never see her sister again or because of a whole world being at stake.
 Still, he was worried about her, and especially that temper of hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned felt surprisingly calm and reassured.
 It was as if he knew that everything was somehow going to work out itself.
 He felt that his new friends were able to hold on their own.
 And even if they never met again, just knowing they were alive somewhere
 made him breath more easily.
 His mind went to Judith suddenly, without cause; there too, was a newly
 found friend.
 He smiled thinly as he ventured a sideways look to the young woman who
 had saved his life back on Tallyflop; he was about to say something to
 her when he felt Winceham's elbow poking him through his ribs:

Trust! Trust, fellow council members and citizens, is the real issue.
 Lady Godiva cannot be entrusted with those responsibilities she so vividly

 How can we trust someone so frivolous with her public image, a person of

 an infatuated child, all glitter and smiles, spending her time in the arms

The good Lord Kennelsey obviously has no real facts to present to this assembly,

 invaluable insight into this new-fangled threat.
 I will not go into the depth and breadth of the threat that Lord Kennelsey's
 fixation with what happens in people's bedrooms might entail for the safety
 of the Human League at large.
 It is perhaps of paramount importance in his own mind, but I have yet to
 see an army of lovers amassing their forces against us.
 We do have proof of the Ygg and their sinister plot though, to covertly
 infiltrate known habitable worlds and insidiously turn their populations

It is no wonder Lady Govida so shamelessly admits her malfeasance to appear

 It is of course a sure sign of growing increasingly power-hungry and arrogant,

 responsibilities.
 She keeps on purveying all about this Ygg threat without one solid piece
 of evidence.
 What we do have to go on is hearsay and imaginary reports from the man

Seriously, this attack on my credibility is Lord Kennelsey's futile and

 If there is one thing Lord Kennelsey is known for, it is his long-standing
 service to the Human League as chancellor and treasurer, secretary to the

Isn't it satisfying to hear Lady Govida use the same line of reasoning against
 me? It is said, imitation is the most sincere form of compliment, and I
 thank her for that.
 But it is not I who seeks to spread lies and disinformation to befuddle
 and daze the public, wary of my pompous ways.
 My service to the Human League is a matter of public record; and if I were
 as arrogant and self-aggrandizing as Lady Govida, I would consider myself
 proud to have served fully and to the best of my ability the Human League
 through means rather less glittery and awe-inspiring than Naval Intelligence

I propose that a small strike team is dispatched to the world of Laertia,

 turn the world into one huge slave camp to further increase their capacity

My point, Lady Govida,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lord Kennelsey said with cold mocking undertones, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

is that we know nothing of their disposition, their forces or their capabilities.
 And if it is one thing we should not let ourselves fall for, is your machinatio
ns in using up resources for a wild goose chase, just so that your enamored
 agent Tark can have one of his many holidays.
 Such matters must be dealt with decisively, in full force and with the
 care and organization that the Human League has strove for over the thousand
 of years of its existence.
 Several scout vessels would be needed to collect information on this imaginary
 enemy of yours, as well as support vessels, at least a legion of armed
 men with their matching troop transports, pickets and destroyers to provide
 cover for such a fleet and last but not least, a flotilla of battle-cruisers
 to provide field support and be able to engage such a supposedly powerful
 enemy with more than just an upper hand.

Master Sisyphus and Lernea were sharing some mead together, enjoying some
 cuts of smoked fish on the side.
 The smell was overpoweringly homely to Lernea.
 She felt the rough wooden table with her hands; it was almost alive to
 her touch.
 A few negligent rays of sun shafted down from what little cracks and holes
 lay in the roof, warming up the make-shift laboratory just the right amount
 to make it feel welcoming despite all the strange apparatus lying about,
 looking menacingly unfathomable and uncomfortably pointy.

 Lernea replied in earnest and drank from her cup; the strong mead made
 her body shiver and her face twitch.
 Sisyphus swallowed his bite and offered Lernea an explanation: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Such is the way of riding the waves of life, Lernea.
 You've just embarked on the Dromos, life's great boat, that's why it can

 Sisyphus said and produced Theo's crystal from a pocket in his robes.
 It looked every bit as perfect as the last time Lernea had laid eyes upon
 it; there was a faint cloud of lights dancing in its very heart, casting
 rays filled with an arcane glow, forming intricate geometrical patterns.
 Lernea was instantly awestruck and nearly drowned as her mouthful of mead

A few moments of silence ensued; nothing but the sounds of birds chirping

 Fidias said as if to correct his master, his eyes searching for a place

 Sisyphus said nothing for an awkward moment and then flung his cup against
 Fidias with a flick of his wrist.
 Fidias dodged the cup expertly and remarked in a quizzical, rather than
 an impertinent manner:

 And hop to it,

 he insisted while the boys sprang into action, raising the lid of a hatch

 Soon, they disappeared down in the basement, sounding busy.
 Lernea offered quietly:

Don't you think you're running the boys a bit too harshly, master? They're

 Judith had been assigned to be their liaison with the ship's commander,

Ned seemed to be in high spirits, and Parcifal was absorbed in watching

There were hundreds of men and women loading up the ships with provisions
 of many kinds, some of which were fairly basic like dried food; for the

 There was understandably quite a hubbub from all the people going back

Judith turned her head and looked at the halfuin with a seriously bland

 A slight shake of her head and a minuscule shrug of her shoulders only

 Judith said, mostly for Ned to hear.

I will protect you to the best of my ability, but I have orders I need to
 follow.
 Don't make me choose, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and looked at the others with a truly sad pair of eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Or any of you.
 My loyalty defines me, it's what makes me useful.

 Ned told her rather coldly.

Then I wish you'd lend it heartily,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and shot Ned an honest, proud look.
 It was Parcifal who stood before Judith, the wind ruffling her short hair,
 her face unperturbed in any way, and told her: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't speak for the others, but I understand a soldier's loyalties cannot
 be divided.
 It would mean her ruin one way or the other.
 I appreciate your candid manner; it is more than most would offer though
 less than I would wish.
 Be it so, I shall stand my ground next to you, sword in hand, to face the
 common enemy as long as it is your wish as well.

\begin_layout Standard
Judith nodded solemnly to Parcifal, while Ned shook his head slowly.
 Winceham shrugged before coughing wildly, his body shaking; he roared and
 grumbled for a few moments, before clearing up his lungs and throat.
 A hearty glob of mucus and spit left his lips and landed a couple of feet
 away, and onto a pair of nice, shiny boots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boots belonged to a tall, almost gaunt man with a smart beard and mustache,
 who looked rather prim and elegant in his suit, full of decorations and
 shiny bars and medals, without threatening his chest to collapse.
 He was wearing a Navy Captain's cap \SpecialChar \-
 skull and anchor sigil \SpecialChar \-
 and owned
 a set of piercing black eyes; by his side, Winceham saw an attache of some
 kind, a rather short fellow with a face seemingly built for smiling, which
 was what he was doing even as he reached for the captain's boots with a
 piece of cloth.
\end_layout

Captain Elsenior Jones?

 Judith asked briskly, to which the captain replied while still eying Winceham
 as if he were an impossible curiosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why, yes.
 I presume you are agent Judith of Naval Intelligence.
 And this is the infamous Alien Trio?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, nodding ever so slightly, not looking the least bit offended about
 the boots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I speak for all when I say that calling us aliens is an insult, captain,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said out of turn, looking stern but not angry.
 The captain replied in kind, even as his attache seemed to have cleaned
 up the glob of spit; realizing the piece of cloth had been rendered useless,
 he tossed it expertly without the captain noticing.
 Winceham offered a slight bow of apology and the attache just shrugged
 it off with a grin and a thumbs-up, which only served to confuse the halfuin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I wouldn't know, sir; it's in the Navy's line of business to insult each

 We find it endearing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the captain said and smiled warmly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Of course, rank does have its privileges.
 Sailors and officer's alike face corporal punishment if they trash-talk
 to the higher ranks.
 Unless it's `Keelhaul' day when anything goes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the captain said in a flat, uninteresting voice.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Enough of Naval tradition.
 I have orders that consider you, Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the captain continued pointing at Ned with a playful finger, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

as vice-admiral in-commission, to lead this fleet in victory.
 Here's the sealed envelope containing the fleet disposition, rules of engagemen

 Ned asked as if he hadn't heard clearly.

 all kinds of funny faces.

 Ned said and Judith simply shot him a wild-eyed look and went up the wooden
 plank stairs to the Magnometriton amidst a heavy, hurt silence.

 Master Sisyphus was engrossed in finding a clean piece of scroll and a
 pen in what undoubtedly was a mess of a laboratory; pieces of equipment

 Sisyphus wondered and shuffled at various desks and shelves at random.
 Before long, he found a suitable piece of scroll that had only been used
 in the most rudimentary way; an old shopping list with enough room in the

 He picked up a jarred piece of a broken glass tube, very much like a sharp-tipp

 Fidias murmured drowsily, right before the wooden planks above their heads

 like living things with a mind of their own, reaching for the two boys.

 Pole-arms! On the double, boys! Cover!

 Sisyphus said and reached under his robes, uncovering a minuscule repeating
 crossbow loaded with unusually sharp cone-shaped bolts.
 The boys fell on the ground instinctively, the clawed hands and tendrils
 grabbing nothing but air.
 Sisyphus had an easy enough target, a blue-black mass of flesh that was
 stuck half-way into the basement.
 He let fly his shots wildly, turning a crank that reloaded the crossbow
 in less than a second.
 All the bolts found their target; the monsters seemed to feel and acknowledge
 that they'd been hit, but it didn't seem to slow them down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They ripped another whole section of flooring and just when they were about
 to jump down, they began trembling uncontrollably, faint rivulets of milky
 fluid oozing from where they'd been stung.
 The next moment, their heads exploded like a toad on a hot summer's day
 without warning, in a messy, gory fashion, milky blood and pieces of tendrils
 and Ygg brains flying in all directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That wasn't supposed to happen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said puzzled, while the boys reappeared from the weapon rack,
 each armed with a wooden training pole-arm easily three times as tall as
 them.
 Lernea popped her head through the flooring, milky white blood stuff dripping
 from her dangling hair.
\end_layout

Master, we need to move.
 Right now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said urgently while behind her Bo flew past in an amazing flying leap,
 shooting fireballs that left a sizzling sound long after they'd flown into
 a couple of directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Not the training pole-arms! The real ones!

 Sisyphus exploded in anger, while tucking the crystal and the piece of

Ready or not, you'll have to do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and reached for an arrow in her quiver before standing up and
 away from the hole in the floor.
 The sounds of battle echoed down below, as otherworldly cries rose up from
 numerous directions.

You heard the queen, boys.
 Consider this a pass if you live,

 Master Sisyphus said, making sure to pickup his old, venerable quarterstaff
 before pulling down the small wooden staircase and climbing it in a hurry.
\end_layout

If we live?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Fidias wondered and Damon shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't suppose this is just another elaborate test?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fidias said, as they too climbed the creaky staircase, wielding the pole-arms
 in a cumbersome manner, very much like fishing poles.
 What they saw at ground floor, left them speechless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The roof of the house had been ripped apart, as if shaved off.
 The walls had mostly turned into rough patches of still standing wood and
 bodies of the same hideous black-and-blue monsters that had attacked them
 lay everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny that had only barely singed a couple of locks off their hair,
 was hopping about, letting go fire-bolts with dead-eye accuracy at the
 ranks of the approaching, abyssal foe that the boys had only believed existed
 in sweat-breaking nightmares, of the sort you really can't wake up from.
 Lernea was picking her targets wisely, covering for Bo, and Theo was levitating
 a foot or so above ground, holding his hands against his ears, as if trying
 to block out everything from his mind.
\end_layout

 Sisyphus asked her.

I went to search for Theo and Bo.
 They were out fishing on the docks, with little success if I may add, when
 the whole village turned on us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea answered flatly.

 Lernea replied shaking her head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Is it possible that you brought them here, my lady?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus said ponderously.

\begin_layout Standard

No way that I can think of,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she replied in earnet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Then they were here already.
 Waiting...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said and let his voice trail off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need to carve out an escape path.
 I'm not sure we can take all of them head on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and let fly an arrow at nearly point blank range right in the
 head of a flying Ygg who was very mute about its death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Excellent tactical analysis, my queen.
 But on the strategic side, if those Ygg were already here, lying in wait...
 That only meant they were waiting for you, and that crystal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus told her as he stood by her side, reloading his crossbow with
 spare bolts from a cupboard-turned-armory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did you find out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied as she nocked another arrow in her bow, waiting for a good
 target to approach them.
 Bo was having a blast, literally, but she was too busy turning Ygg into
 crispy stumps to even send a thought on the matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Their father,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said nodding at Theo and Bo, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

he's alive and well, but hiding.
 He knows what the Ygg are truly after.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That information was inside the crystal? Who is he?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked impatiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A very talented, ingenious individual by the name of Athmoor Radaniel.
 What's even more important, he's marked a way for us to track him down.

 Sisyphus said with a voice full of untimely melancholy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's that? What's so important about that thing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said as she let a double-shot fly, felling two Ygg, their heads
 perfectly pierced where it mattered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Everything!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus said, sounding excited and scared at the same time, a feeling
 he very rarely exhibited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suggest you take some kind of cover, master,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea told him, looking at Theo with a cautionary gaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus wondered, as if the hordes of the Ygg trying to kill them were
 not justification enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo is right about ready to blow them all to pieces,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He can do that? How?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus asked her, sounding very interested in the mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Something called Rho,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she replied and closed her eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you say Po?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Master Sisyphus said and Lernea replied with a shake of her head and said
 `Rho' once more.
 Only, no matter how loud her shout, her mouth seemed to simply open and
 close, in a slow, languid fashion, the sound of the compression shock that
 expanded from Theo visible in the air, blanketing everything in all directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And indeed, just like a stone makes waves when it lands on water, so did
 the power of Rho reverberate in a radius all around them, the Ygg writhing
 in sudden, terrible agony before their heads exploded in a gory mess of
 milky blood, pieces of tendrils and cerebral matter flying about, leaving
 their bodies slumped hard against the ground, exactly like a puppet on
 torn-away strings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I hope to the Gods Master won't make us clean this up,

 Damon said under his breath before Theo collapsed on the floor with a dull

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Fidias was heard then and seeing his master's squinting gaze, realised

The rest of the fleet should be arriving in the vicinity of Laertia within

 Shall I signal the Magnometriton?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the short, thick-set captain of the HLS 
\shape italic
Maryland
\shape default
 asked Ned, eagerly waiting for a reply.
 Ned was surveying the starry landscape with an intricate eye-piece that
 only served to make the distant stars a tad less brighter.
 Nothing remotely strange registered; instead, the world of Laertia rotated
 slowly, filling most of the star-scape with its blue, white and green hues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not yet, captain.
 I don't see anything strange.
 It's just that I'd never fully realised how beautiful home was,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said thoughtfully and turned to look at the captain with a furrowed
 brow.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have you noticed anything strange, Mr.
 Peelpot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he then asked the plump little man whose uniform looked about ready to
 burst.
 The captain of the HLS 
\shape italic
Maryland
\shape default
 gave the matter the short time of attention it required and formulated
 an easy enough answer: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're running low on beer, sir, and as any half-competent sailor will tell
 you, that could prove to be troublesome.
 A beer-disgruntled crew is no laughing matter; I'll check the stores personally
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, turned about crisply and quickly disappeared below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was under the impression that, with the ship being so small and all, there's
 very little crew involved.
 In fact,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said, not having realised the captain was gone.
 He then nodded at Winceham who was shooting craps with a small gang of
 sailors under the main mast of the Maryland and added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there's the whole lot of the crew right there.
 They look disgruntled all right, but I wouldn't suppose it's because of
 the beer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he pointed out as another wave of boos and awfully uncharming swearing
 rose out from a half-dozen men who seemed to be having a suspiciously long-wind
ed streak of bad luck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Seven times in a row? Again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried one of the crew.
 Judging from the look on his face, even if he was probably not very well
 versed in statistics, he knew there was something terribly lucky about
 winning seven times in a row, again.
 And everyone knew, luck has the propensity to run out in the end, not the
 other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is seven a bad number for you? How about eight?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said with a provocatively smug grin, just about ready to throw
 the dice once more.
 Another one of the crew rose up to his full height, which was a little
 more than twice Winceham's diminutive, halfuin-standard size.
 He gave Winceham a very haunting look that more than implied bad things
 were just waiting to happen, but Winceham continued unfazed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bets? Anyone? No?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked around, more comfortable-looking than a pig rolling in mud.
 He received no reply and just as he was ready to pick up the small pile
 of coins resting on the ship's floor, the tall, heavy-set sailor who otherwise
 looked like a nice fellow, if one could go around the fact he could crush
 a man larynx single-handedly, he told him in a rather calm yet threatening
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No ya don't.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham cocked his head sideways and looked at him the way kids look at
 obnoxious neighbors.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

These are my winnings.
 You know what winnings are, don't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said as he made ready to gather the small shiny golden pile in
 his cupped hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're a thief,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said one of the other sailors through gritted teeth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham laughed a polite little laugh before making a gesture with his
 hand, implying that was no secret to anyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And a liar,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 another sailor added with some more bravado.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now I won't have any of that name-calling.
 First and foremost, I'm a gentleman and I demand that honor be satisfied,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said in a passionate voice even as he began sweeping the coins
 with the cup of his hand off the ship's deck and into his money pouch.
 Every last one of the sailors had lost money in that dice game.
 A lot of money, perhaps equal to half a month's pay, which amounts to about
 a quarter of their drinking money.
 Which was a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them took the dice into his hand for the first time since Winceham
 started shooting, and felt them in his hands.
 Then he held one up and turned it round and round; they looked like perfectly
 ordinary dice.
 He shot one down on the deck, letting it roll freely; the dice hopped and
 spun, and fumbled and sat in one of its faces with a seriously ponderous
 wobble.
 The face was adorned with the crude drawing of an anchor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anchor.
 Again,

 he said and looked at Winceham, through angry, red-shot eyes.

\begin_layout Standard

I wouldn't hope to explain to you the intricate workings of a game of luck,

 Winceham said with a barb in his voice, his withered, leathery face twitching
 in a well-placed insult.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What's that mean? Someone like me?

 the sailor asked.

\begin_layout Standard

 Winceham replied, acting like an innocent git who was only happening to

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You playin's us for a fool now, eh?

 another, bulkier crewman said, rising up to Winceham, his shadow occluding
 him easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fools are a lot more fun than you fellas, even the bad ones,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham retorted, cooly smug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The group got up on their feet and huddled around Winceham, just about ready
 to unanimously vote on giving him the old silent soap-in-a-sock treatment.
 Ned, seeing where things were headed, demanded their attention, trying
 his most conversational, level-headed tone of voice: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, gentlemen, I'm sure we're all a little uptight about the mission and
 all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The men slowly looked at Ned with a curious kind of gaze, the kind people
 might think lizards look like when copulating.
 It was eerie and uncomfortable, but Ned had somehow gotten their attention
 for a moment, only to have Winceham pull them back in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

See what I mean? Even the bad ones are kind of fun,

 the tall muscle-bound sailor said and grabbed Winceham by his leather jacket,
 and whisked him into the air with just one hand.
 Winceham looked down upon the tall sailor and the rest of the men who nodded
 approvingly to what their idea of justice looked like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Now, let's not make any hasty decisions,

 Ned said and added with a generous smile and a show of his hands,

 someone else said and the others agreed heartily, nodding in mumbling unison.

 someone intoned.

 another one asked indignantly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh.
 Guess you've heard that one before,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said to himself mostly and another sailor, the eldest of the crew,
 the one who had misheard earlier, did so again: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Rump, did you say? Wot's going on? Is there lamb to be had on this ship?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

 someone roared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aye!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the crew cheered unanimously, cradling mops and brooms, as well as ropes

 like smoking pipes and switchblades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could you be so kind as to hold me up a little higher, now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Winceham asked strangely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nah, I'm not kind enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the tall sailor said grinning.
 Winceham replied after weighing in his options for a moment: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That'll have to do then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the halfuin said and kicked hard and high, aiming for the sailor's jaw.
 Instead, he missed and his boot connected with the sailor's nose; a crunching
 sound was heard and blood spurted, some of it spilling on his boot.
 The sailor growled with pain and the next instant, a shout was heard from
 someone in the crew:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a free-for-all!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fists began flying and various instruments of seamanship found a new use
 as bruising, head-crushing implements.
 Stools and pegs were in good supply and eagerly used as well.
 Ned hadn't realised how easy it was for a gambling issue to escalate into
 a full-fledged fist-fight.
 They had only been out to space for a day or so, and yet the beer had run
 dry, and the crew was already fighting amongst themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wince? Stop monkeying around! These people are trying to help!

 Ned shouted, only to receive a muffled answer of sorts a little while later:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But it's my money now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of Winceham's voice trailed off into a dusty cloud of fists and
 brawler's growls.
 He was well into the fight, and Ned knew that the captain of the HLS 
\shape italic
Maryland
\shape default
 should be taking things into his hands sooner rather than later; unfortunately
 he discovered the captain was ostentatiously drunk, trying to steer the
 ship by using a strange mechanism that included a dead fish and one of
 those dangerous-looking, multicolored cannonballs.
 He was experiencing difficulties keeping the dead fish level on the rolling
 cannonball.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What the hell happened to rigor mortis, eh? Bloody useless fish.
 Throw'em out to dead space, I say!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Captain Peelpot urged no-one in particular, and Ned sadly realised he was
 all alone, at least until the rest of the fleet arrived.
 Ned took the helm, smiling all the time at the captain who looked at him
 with a wild-eyed look of confoundment and asked him with glazed, red-shot
 eyes:
\end_layout

Come to me, my bristling sea-wench, smelling of salty toffee, wet like the

 Captain Peelpot cried and throwing the dead fish aside, tried to grab Ned
 with arms open-wide and kiss him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was very nearly taken off-guard and side-stepped the drunk-like-a-bat
 captain at the last moment; he put out his foot and tripped him, but as
 Captain Peelpot was going down, he reached out a hand and grabbed Ned from
 the belt of his pants, bringing him down with him.
 The prospect of being fondled on the deck of a very fast picket by a drunken
 captain of the Human League did not appeal to Ned who held on to the helm,
 making the ship roll with him vicariously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship swerved violently and changed attitude and course as if some gigantic
 hand slapped its sides; and it was at that exact moment that Ned saw a
 blinding flash of purplish light fill the void of space above them, casting
 pinkish shades all over the ship.
 A great swath of light, like a flaming torrent of pure energy had missed
 them by a couple of seconds, Ned realised, and just a look whence the intense
 light came, made everything so much clearer and darker at the same time.

A huge oblong shadowy shape, stony black and flashing blue at times, was

 bizarre crystal constructs dominated its surface.
 It was sort of terrible ship, shaped like a malevolent arrowhead made of

The mess they'd left behind them was a grim reminder of what may lay ahead

 Bo was leading the party in nearly complete darkness.
 She'd lit her eyes up just so that there was enough light for them not

The party continued on, passing through rough-cut service tunnels made by
 man as well natural crevices that widened abruptly or became barely passable.
 The whole underground tunnel system was filled with caves, large and small;
 housing room and storage space indeed, by the looks of it.
 They hurried by, following a twisting and turning path as directed by Sisyphus

 He gave simple, short directions at every junction, and Bo hopped along
 in silence, lighting their path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boys weren't exactly restless but they could be heard whispering idly
 from time to time.
 Invariably, Master Sisyphus turned and gave them a look, which somehow
 penetrated the nearly complete darkness and made the boys fall silent once

 There was even the hint of a shudder when they realised there would be
 serious reprisals when the proper time came.

Bo, lights,

 she said and the next instant the cave filled with a clear, bright light
 that seemed to come from nowhere in particular.
 The vision that filled everyone's eyes made them freeze in place, holding
 their breaths.
 Everywhere around the cave's walls which was large enough to be a king's
 court, there were strange, egg-like things clinging on to the rock and
 dirt like outrageously oversized clams.
 Even in the stony pillars that held the ceiling, interspersed around the
 cave, these odd eggs lay, scaly and silvery, fish-like in appearance, yet
 trembling and pulsating like living things should.

 This is not natural, it is the Ygg's doing.

 Sisyphus replied with his thoughts firmly on the task at hand and cautiously
 moved forward.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's the plug, that circular plate of metal over there,

 he said and pointed with his staff to a manhole cover, jutting out of the
 ceiling at the end of a wide cast metal pipe a few yards away.

We need to get to the Walled Garden.
 It is where the so-called monument is being constructed.

 he asked once more and looked behind him only to discover they weren't

 other, as if the eggs were just one of many curious toys.

 Sisyphus shouted, his voiced raised to an echoing din.

 Their heads drooped, even as one by one, the eggs started sprouting open,
 in the shape of a certain exotic peeled fruit.

 Sisyphus said and the boys sprung into a running spree, like a pile of
 hot coals was shoved down their backsides.
 At the same moment, the eggs opened up fully, each one revealing a tentacled
 larva the size of a large rat, arrayed in dark, glistening scales, hundreds
 of pseudo-pods writhing under their carapace as they emerged and began
 crawling around the floor and the walls of the cave, menacingly drawn to
 the party.

 he shouted as he turned the manhole a full circle, unscrewing it and tossing

 writhing certainty.

A sleek, fiery streak of light, metal and wood hurled itself across the

 Close behind it like an incessant hound on its mark, was the jagged hulk

 Ned replied from the deck, where he was helping the crewmen take out a
 fire that threatened to burn down the main mast.
 The ship's hull glowed with a warm, at times fierce orange and silvery
 light as they entered the planet with a speed far superior to the one the
 ship had been designed for.
 Unfortunately for them, the Ygg behemoth which closely resembled a sharp
 flying mountain like a magnified chipped stone spear-tip had little trouble
 keeping up.

 Ned added from a prone position on the deck, after a sudden violent lurch

 A wide beam of purple, eldritch light thick as shadows shot by the ship's
 starboard side, right beside the ship's waterline, filling the air with
 a reverberating, fizzing and crackling sound.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Parcifal!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted out, his eyes searching for Parcifal frantically.
 He saw her then, at the stern of the ship, perched inside a huge throne-like
 enclosure, like a bird in a cage with a pretty hefty-looking cannon attached
 to it.
 Then the whole assembly she was controlling through all sorts of levers
 intricately connected to a whirring, rotating mass of cogs and rods, shook
 in its entirety as a violent, blinding, multi-hued colored flash of light
 followed a fireball shot forth from the cannon's muzzle in a show of sputtering
 fireworks.
 A moment or so later the shot landed at the Ygg ship, tearing down a jutting
 rock spire and stripping it away from the main ship, crumbling in the air
 as the turbulent air wrecked it to pieces.
 The Ygg ship seemed to have noticed, trying to swerve a moment too late,
 but only barely; it answered with a massive volley of violet bursts of
 raw energy in a square-grid pattern, its source a neatly packed, shiny
 mass of rough-hewn crystals.

 replied the crew-master, expertly unfazed even as a violet ray of death

 Ned yelled, running toward her, the mast behind him snapping in two like
 a badly burned fire log, just when Winceham put the

 The sudden lurching motion threw everyone off their feet, except for Parcifal
 who was tied down in her cannon cage and Winceham who held on to the helm
 as if it were the last mug of beer in the universe, his body going flat,
 in line with the deck.
 The rest of the crewmen were very professional about it all and simply
 held on to anything they could, their expressionless face a testament to
 their seamanship and complete ignorance of danger, even when faced with
 it, clear and present.

 she said while another tap on her knee made her pull on the firing lever,
 and another fiery ball of light and destruction was hurled against the
 Ygg battleship, missing at the last moment.
 The Ygg ship was steadily closing in and this time replied with another
 salvo of hooked chains and anchors flying in an lopsided arc, aiming to
 land and latch on to the HLS

 Ned exploded, completely unaware of a deadly mass of iron in the shape

 Ned saw a flash of silver then and feared for the worst.
 Before he had time enough to speak a word, the fog lifted as if some giant
 hand pulled away a huge bedcover, and what they could now see, was something
 they didn't have time to realize fully.

\begin_layout Standard
An Ygg was standing between the crew-master and Parcifal, Encelados protruding
 from the monster's belly, its blue-on-blue eyes flickering with their dying

 Winceham screamed and took out his daggers, tumbled swiftly on the deck

 The Ygg turned around and with a throaty yell lunged at Winceham, its tentacles
 writhing morbidly.
 Ned went for his crossbow and loaded a bolt, before realizing the Ygg warship

The ship keeled slightly to its left and began a whimpering free-fall, bereft

Parcifal folded her arms and fell downwards like a bird of stone, flying

 Their eyes were sharp and clean, bereft of fear.
 Ned had closed his eyes, his legs splayed and his arms wide.
 Winceham was trying to steady himself in the air, fumbling for his tobacco

 Her face was cast in a reverend agony, while her feet and hands began to

 Her clothes were ripped apart even as her head became elongated, her forehead
 becoming a bony, enlarged plate.
 Her nose turned into a snout and her skin turned into a leathery, deeply-scaled
 hide, red and orange, the colour of fire.

In the span of a few heartbeats, she had turned fully into a dragon, red

 Parcifal, in her dragonform, twist in the air gracefully and clutch Ned

 He then saw her coming for him, swooping down like a majestic predator.
 He was confused, feeling unsure whether or not he'd been kind enough to

Theo was in the middle of a rough circle formed by the rest; Lernea was
 down to her last few arrows, and Bo couldn't shoot her fireballs fast enough.
 She barely had enough thaumaturgy left in her to hop around.
 Damon and Fidias were using their slings and blowpipes to little effect,
 while Master Sisyphus was quietly contemplating their situation.
 Everyone's feet were wet, except for Theo who was hovering above the water
 of the shallow lake uncannily, as if praying solemnly.
 Around them, hundreds of Ygg were closing in, marching instead of charging,
 as if they were biding their time, reveling in the promise of the coming
 slaughter.

 Fidias said and reloaded his sling with a pebble from the Hallowed Lake,
 letting it fly hard against an Ygg a few yards away.
 The pebble struck the Ygg in its mouth, whereas it begun choking and convulsing
, before crumbling down onto its clawed feet and splashing in the lake.
 Others quickly replaced their fallen kin and followed in its steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Damon first and then Fidias felt a harsh, bony thing hit them hard against
 their cheeks, followed by a slapping sound.
 It was Master Sisyphus, who had shown them once again the back of his hand,
 while the rest of the party kept tightening the circle around Theo as if
 partaking in a silent, slow dance with death itself, every movement sombre
 and unique.

 Sisyphus exclaimed and his face instantly returned to an unusually calm
 look of deep introspection.
 He then looked at the sky, and noticed that higher up near the clouds,
 a dozen or maybe more dark spots were being brilliantly lit from flashes
 of light.
 Various colours doused them in a flame-like appearance.
 Then he noticed the flapping wings of a red dragon, and his thin, craggy
 lips curled into a tight smile.

 Lernea said and looked behind Theo, exchanging a knowing glance with her
 former Master and mentor.
 She knew then he wasn't talking about the Ygg - he looked up and saw the
 large red dragon coming down right on top of them, behind her, higher up
 into the clouds, strange-looking blots that were probably some kind of
 ship, literally having a blast.
\end_layout

For a moment she thought when it was the last time she had seen a dragon

 Bo sent, and perched herself on Theo's shoulder, huffing and puffing from
 the exertion, feeling her powers nearly spent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal spat a gush of fire from her snout, engulfing a row of Ygg in writhing
 flames, their raspy throats letting out otherworldly growls of dying pain.
 Her attack cleared some space in front of Lernea, while she flapped her
 wings quickly, breaking hard and releasing Winceham and Ned from a couple
 of feet into the lake, letting them splash feebly in the water, meeting
 its shallow bottom with their faces.

 Lernea said sternly, while Parcifal let the surviving crew of the Maryland
 disembark from her back.
 A shot of bright blue light like thunder-flash cut a swath of Ygg down
 like a reaper's giant scythe.
 It was Sisyphus, who was looking at his staff with a sad, pitiful gaze.
 Winceham and Ned got back on their feet, Ned loading his crossbow with
 a fresh bolt and Winceham brandishing both his daggers, eying his next
 move against the approaching Ygg.

 Lernea yelled, rising her short sword up in the air; then the two sisters
 charged headlong against the oncoming wave of the Ygg, cutting a path through
 them even as the monstrous abominations tried their best to slash and pierce
 them with their claws, their tendrils aiming to grab them in any way possible.
 Lernea hacked, swiveled and pierced them again, while Parcifal swiped with
 her claws and breathed fire upon them, cutting down half a dozen Ygg at
 a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters were a terrible sight to behold, looking invincible, a powerful
 natural force of righteous revenge.
 But behind them, Theo was struggling with an unseen foe, his veins jutting

 Damon cried in terror, while Fidias popped up from behind him and stuck
 the foremost Ygg with his knife.
 Once, twice and then three times; yet the Ygg didn't fall, white blood
 oozing from his punctured wounds.
 As the Ygg was about to lunge at Damon's head, his tentacled maw twitched
 with the expectation of feeding on a young mind.

 cried Sisyphus and struck the Ygg squarely on its head, bringing his staff

 The crew-master of the Maryland urged his people then to stand fast:

 the crewman replied shaking his head and shrugged.
 A moment later the claws of an Ygg were dug deep in his neck, his tentacled
 maw attached to the back of the man's head.
 His eyes twitched and rolled impossibly, his face chock-full of mortal
 horror, even as his eyes were drawn inside from their sockets, the contents
 of his head sucked through the Ygg's maw.
 A heavy cutlass struck clean against the Ygg, its head rolling while still
 alive, its tentacles still writhing with the splendor of a fresh kill.
 The crew-master looked at the Ygg with disgust as its body lay slumped
 against the empty husk of the crewman who had just asked for his due break.

 Winceham suggested as he unstuck his daggers from a dead Ygg, tumbling
 at the last moment to avoid a deadly claw attack from another.
 Ned shot his crossbow at point-blank range, felling two Ygg with one bolt.
 He swerved to the side and dodged a dozen or so tendrils aiming for his
 waist, before kicking the Ygg hard in the face, making it dizzy for just
 enough time to hack at its head with a machete.
 The first hack dug deep; the second and the third made the killing a nasty,
 messy affair.

\begin_layout Standard
It was at that moment that everyone felt a wave of pressure overcoming them,
 feeling it reverberate through their bones.
 They saw the Ygg then tremble, growling in agony for a moment before succumbing
 to Theo's powerful Rho, splashing in the water in an outward pattern, like
 stalks of grass blown against the wind.
 Theo fell down awkwardly with a splash as well, planting his feet in the
 bottom of the lake, gasping for breath, sweating profusely.

 the crew-master said feeling at ease and the crew sat down in the shallow
 water, the water up to their waist as their buttocks touched the pebble-bed
 floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The small host of riders galloped at an easy pace, the horses' hooves splashing
 in the water in a strange, perfect rhythm.
 A man wearing the Jangdrival's colors over a shiny full-plate armor was
 at the head of the host, all in all no more than a dozen riders.
 Beside him rode a banner-man, flying the colours of the Jangdrivals proudly,

Once it reached the boundaries of the Ygg crystal, the sphere of light collapsed

Ned opened his eyes lazily; he saw a stone-crafted ceiling, rough but elegantly
 put together, each piece of stone fitting, well-placed.
 Soft, golden-hued light bathed the room he was in from a wide-arched, paned-gla

 Outside, rows of chestnut tress could be seen with snow-capped mountains
 in the distance.

\begin_layout Standard
He felt the mattress comfortably hugging his body; he felt tired, his muscles
 aching for stillness.
 He heard the chirruping sound of birds; it reminded him of lazy mornings.
 He put his hands on his belly above the soft beddings, and felt content
 just by being there.
 He remembered the terrible white that occluded every other sense, and the
 thought of perhaps being dead entered his head.
 He stared vacantly at the ceiling for a moment, uninterested in the sparse
 fittings of the room; there was a simple bedside table where a jar stood
 and a low wooden table with an empty candlestick.
 And that was that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then heard the door to the room swing open; the face of a woman appeared
 through it timidly, as if he was being pried upon.
 He had no recollection of seeing her before, but her face was elven-like
 in its appearance, a sight to behold.
 Silver-haired with a face of simple, elegant beauty, she presented herself
 fully; she wore linen, heavy robes of a dark brown, starkly contrasted
 with her milky skin.
 If she had been wearing white, he'd be tempted to think once more he had
 died and this was what angels looked like.
 She smiled at him tentatively and bringing her palms together awkwardly,
 she spoke with a girly voice that made her impossible not to like:

 Lernea said and looking at Ned, stepped in front of Bo, as if protecting

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What did I do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned demanded and slid off his bed in order to protest.
 He felt a rush of cold air in his nether regions; it was Lernea's shocked
 eyes and Bo's curious gaze that alerted him to the reality of being completely
 naked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cover your eyes!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea shouted to Bo even as Ned began to feel inadequately embarrassed,
 his face flush red, and his hands reflexively trying to cover up the offending
 area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What for? I've seen everyone naked,

 Bo said sounding quite uninterested and left the room with a nod and a

I used to be a bunny, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said without turning to look back even as Lernea looked at Ned with
 a sour face and told him: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wipe that grin off your face.

The large expanse of the dining hall echoed with the harmonious sounds of
 lutes and flutes.
 The din of the chattering people wasn't invasive, pervasive though it was.
 Ned was feeling a lot more comfortable among normal, yet completely unknown
 people.
 He was sitting next to Master Sisyphus who was enjoying a cup of mead,
 his watchful eyes meandering around the room, and always affording Damon
 and Fidias who had been assigned as honorary guards to Lernea and Parcifal
 a wary gaze that kept them on their toes, even if that did not add much
 to their overall height.

 Ned began reiterating.
 Sisyphus nodded and sipped quietly.

 Sisyphus nodded once more, after pausing to think for a moment.

And you don't remember how any of it happened exactly?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned asked with worry in his voice.
 Master Sisyphus cleared his throat before answering: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What I can clearly remember is that I used the Metathaumaturgic device as
 a Resonating Amplifier for a powerful disintegration spell, just when Bo
 got in the way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

So you kind of disintegrated her? Along with the huge crystal the Ygg had

 Ned asked sounding rather concerned about what had happened to the crystal.
 He then heard Judith's voice as she pulled the empty, heavy, thick-built
 chair beside him and sat down.

A loud gong was heard then suddenly, its ringing reverberating across the

As he did so, Lernea appeared from behind a wide-arched doorway, Parcifal

 kind and honorable in their demeanor, as they eyed the room with an elevated
 sense of duty.
 The guests, hundreds of them, rose from their seats and bowed in total
 silence.
 It didn't look like a sign of subservience; it rather looked like a show

Lernea stood by a thick piece of stone, carved in the semblance of a stool

 seat herself.
 Parcifal stood right beside her, not a step behind.
 They both scanned the dining hall with bright, gleaming eyes; a thin smile

 she had been for the past few days.

It hasn't been that long if we were to measure time by the rising and the

 Mountain and the values of our forefathers.
 That is the very heart and essence of our being, our way of life and our
 code of honor.
 For without law and honor, we are but beasts made to look like men.
 Without fairness and goodness of heart, we are but tools to be used, wielded

 she said with a crystal clear, strong voice.

I came to realise, perhaps too late for comfort, how a far darker thing

 It is an evil of many faces, but one name: the Ygg,

 protection.
 Lernea paused for a moment before she went on.

Good fortune and the guiding light of Svarna showed me the True Path; with

The crowd cheered and voices of praise rose up to the ceiling.
 After the crowd settled back into listening, Lernea continued.

And that is why I must take leave of my reigning duties, for now.
 Because I cannot, and will not rest, until this scourge is nothing but
 a memory, a footprint in the annals of our time.
 Haste is of paramount importance; there are certain things that have been
 put in motion which must be acted upon now, lest the tide turns once more
 against us.
 I have trust in you to carry on your duties like you have always done,
 obeying the laws and listening to the heart of the Holy Mountain.
 We will have the aid of our newly-found allies, bonded in the heat of battle,
 the proud alliance of human worlds, the Human League.
