\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a sinister threat lurking in the cosmos.
 It is a dark, sticky as tar and far worse than mouldy cheese.
 It reaches in places you would never believe or feel comfortable with;
 its livid tendrils sneakily out to get everything that's fair and beautiful
 around us, even unicorns.
 I must do as my conscience bids me; I must fight to expose their ill-doings
 and bring them down once and for all.
 There's a lot of danger involved which means I'll probably die or go mad
 in the process.
 But I have to do this, for the sake of my children alone.
 And perhaps all the things I find dear in the world, like Taem berries.
 And roast veeb.
 Perhaps, Rovenii mead and Yule beer as well.
 Just thinking about what is at stake here, makes me ravenous.

\begin_layout Quotation
-- Athmoor Radaniel, from his personal journal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea felt her face set against something wet and grainy.
 As if caught in the moment between wakefulness and sleep, her mind felt
 numb, soft and muddy.
 A word popped in her head: Sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wet sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her face was half-buried in a patch of wet sand.
 There was a feeling of cold water splashing against her body every now
 and then.
 Maybe it was time to go to the latrine she thought to herself, but quickly
 realised it was the feeling of waves embracing her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A beach then, she came to realise and opened her eyes half-expecting everything
 to be a dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no silken bedding around her, no morning sun's glory behind laced
 curtains; just a misty, fog-laden beach with low, crumbled rock outcroppings
 in the hazy distance which wasn't much of a distance at all.
 The sun was hidden behind a grim overcast sky.
 Lazy grey clouds barely seemed to move.
 A harsh, cold salty breeze made her face flush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw the white bunny rabbit to her right, the way her head lay; Bo was
 munching on a small brush of saltweed when she looked her way as if enabled
 by some sixth or even seventh sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good, you're awake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words rang crystal clear in Lernea's head; she was instantly confused.
 It was a woman's voice, warm and cheerful.
 Her first thought was she had either bumped her head somewhere along the
 way or had gone mad.
 Voices in her head were more than she could cope with - it was the worst
 time to check her sanity levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's alright.
 It's me, Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said while Bo munched away, seemingly possessed by a real appetite
 for destroying saltweed bushes.
 Lernea squinted at the bunny with a puzzled, weary look.
 For all she knew and cared for, a talking bunny made as much sense as a
 magical, fire-spouting one.
 What felt weird was Bo appeared to be female.
 That wasn't a life-threatening situation, Lernea knew; she'd just come
 out of one alive and well.
 And quite wet, she added as an afterthought.
 She sighed and suddenly wished for a steamy hot cup of Chamoleon: she could
 almost smell it too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised her head slightly above the wet sand and felt a sudden, awful
 dizziness.
 She remembered the drop into that churning nightmarish fire and the flash;
 a bright, blinding flash.
 She remembered Theo falling right behind her, clasping her hand and Bo's
 eyes flaring up as as if the small white bunny would explode with a hail
 of brimstone and fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She dug her hands in the sand and propped herself up; her shoulders felt
 sore.
 She looked to her left and saw Theo laying there, his back against a patch
 of damp sand with arms splayed and eyes closed, where the waves would barely
 lick his body.
 Her mind flashed with a horrifying thought; she felt her stomach tie itself
 in a knot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's just sleeping.
 He was actually snoring a little while back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can read minds now as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea audibly, with just the right amount of annoyance in her
 voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, it's not that hard to tell what crossed your mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and dug her rabbit body under a rocky ledge where the wind seemed
 to die down and sat there snugly.
 Lernea replied with a stare and a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She drove a hand through her hair reflexively; it was a ragged mess with
 pieces of seaweed clunging on like little green braids.
 Her leather bodice was soaking wet and her boots made squishy sounds.
 She felt wet and miserable, her only measure of relief the reassuring weight
 of her bow strung against her back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aren't you cold? At all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked her timidly; her little bunny body shivered involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am the rightful Queen of Nomos, the Kingdom of the North,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied in a stern voice.
 She felt better just by saying that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, you're accustomed to this cold, I take it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know, Theo would need to ask something as obvious as that.
 Are you two related, by chance?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actually, Theo is my brother,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and even in Lernea's mind her voice had an awkward feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised an eyebrow and took a long, hard stare at Bo.
 Then she shook her head and looked at Theo, silver-haired with a touch
 of blond, the wet, ragged dreadlocks adorning his elven face with all the
 grace of a mop.
 She burst out laughing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're funny! Better than Ned!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm serious.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo's words nearly made Lernea's mind feel a bit heavier with all the weight
 the voice carried suddenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea blinked furiously as if something were caught in her eye.
 Her face became taut suddenly; she stared back at the sea like a castaway
 waiting for a ship that'd never sail by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned.
 And Parcifal.
 They're not here, are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and walked over to Theo, vague moulds of her boots trailing behind
 her on the impressionable sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Neither is Winceham,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo voiced.
 Lernea shot her a frowned look and paused mid-stride.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The weird, short fellow.
 Don't you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked with a hint of worry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin, really.
 I remember.
 I'm not really sure what exactly happened, that's all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat down beside Theo, legs crossed.
 Locks of her hair were stuck against her face.
 She looked to windward, her arms laid back against the sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want the short version, or the long version?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wager we're not in a hurry.
 If someone wanted us dead, they'd done it by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shouldn't we wake Theo up as well? He might want to hear all this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added as an afterthought.
 Bo twitched her nose and hopped towards the sea, soaking her bunny feet
 in some wet sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He gets a bit antsy if you wake him up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said in Lernea's mind.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's kind of groggy and slow-minded for a while afterwards,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added and backed away playfully from a slightly frothing wave.
 Bo seemed to be having some kind of fun, despite it all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For a while? Like what, a whole day?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a sneer.
 Bo turned her bunny head uncannily towards Lernea; her eyes seemed to brighten
 up a little - it was a reflex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, that's not nice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she sent to Lernea's mind; there was some sadness involved, rather than
 anger.
 Lernea looked at Bo for a moment and closed her eyes.
 Right beside her, Theo could be heard, snoring lightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean it like that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and awkwardly ran a finger in the sand, drawing random curves
 and shapes.
 Bo seemed satisfied; the bunny's eyes lost their glint and she turned to
 look at the sea once more, her head bobbing slightly as if mesmerized by
 the waves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's true though, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said after a while.
 The bunny looked at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he can be a little daft sometimes.
 But he did save us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and hopped merrily towards Theo and snuggled right beside his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He did? I thought that was you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied, genuinely surprised to hear that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried, but there wasn't much I could do other than put a shield around
 us.
 The wormhole that brought us her in the nick of time, that was Theo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a while, Lernea stared at Theo as if in shock.
 The sound of waves dying a few feet away rose easily above the eerie silence.
 Bo blinked at Lernea without saying a word.
 Overhead, a sea bird of some kind croaked.
 It drew Lernea's stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was goofy with magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, whatever he did, trust me; it wasn't magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and wiggled her nose.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo is magically inert.
 Has been ever since I can remember,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the bunny said and dug its face in Theo's sand-ridden dreadlocks, before
 pulling it out again sharply - as if it smelled something unruly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was a sorcerer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He seemed to be; well, kind of.
 Sometimes at least,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added shrugging, sounding clearly confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 I just made it appear so; I'm the sorceress in the family,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and her bunny eyes flared up with a tinge of red flame that was
 snuffed out the next instant, just to illustrate her point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just for appearances?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked.
 Bo leapt above Theo's slowly rising and falling chest and perched herself
 on top of a mass of rocks.
 She stood straight up and looked around, surveying the misty landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin knew.
 I have a soft spot for Theo, what can I say? I thought it was prudent as
 well.
 Magical bunnies aren't a dime a dozen - if word got out..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo let the words echo faintly in Lernea's mind.
 She gave Bo a weird squinting look - it was her calculating, thinking look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're in hiding, aren't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's right.
 Have been for years.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

From who? Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have no idea.
 Just the words of my father, ringing in my head,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to Lernea and paused, sniffing the air.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hide.
 That's all I can remember.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I can relate to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a shallow voice.
 Her face flushed red, remembering how she and Parcifal were cast out, humiliate
d, to be excised from memory, from history even.
 As they never had existed.
 She bit her lip and her mind turned to the quandary at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then how did he do whatever it was he did that saved us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked and pointed at Theo, looking baffled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The wormhole? I haven't got the slightest idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and uncannily shook her head slowly like a human would.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Same goes about the place we've ended up at,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, her nose twitching faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It could've been worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and stood up.
 A cold breeze snapped against her hard, lean face.
 She felt invigorated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We could have been charred to the bone or flash-steamed into space, that's
 true,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and began scouring the sand and rock for signs of moss or something
 generally green and edible.
 She sniffed profusely, like only a sort of herbivore hound would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, this place could have been worse.
 Far worse.
 It however kind of feels..
 Homely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said after pausing to find the word.
 She cleaned some of the sand off her pants, but the majority of the grains
 mostly clung on heedless.
 Bo's eyes widened and she turned her bunny head around at an impossible
 angle - anyone passing by would have been horrified by the unnatural movement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's homely about this cold, wet place? I can barely see what's out there.
 And as far as I can see there's nothing but rocks - not even a tint of
 moss.
 The sun is hidden - there is no way to tell the time.
 It's moody and grey, suggestive of a rainy afternoon without the rain.
 It's \SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kind of like home, indeed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This place reminds you of home?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked Lernea, the thought echoing with a positively unenthused quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Reminds me of Thraka; the northern reaches.
 My sister and I spent a whole summer there when we were kids.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Must've been a lovely summer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and dug in a shadowy cleft where lo and behold, a cluster of mushrooms
 lay.
 She began nibbling at them after barely shooting them a peremptory look.
 They didn't seem poisonous, at first glance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was; we went whale fishing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied.
 Bo was focused on the mushrooms, making sure to eat just the caps; she
 never did like the stems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was being sarcastic but never mind.
 Whale fishing, you say? Just how old were you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Twelve.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What kind of kids go whale hunting?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We were rarely, if ever, normal kids, even by Nomos' standards.
 We were born to become queens, mind you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was under the vague impression that queens go for croquet and tea parties,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and somehow her thoughts conveyed a sense of insatiable hunger,
 even while the mushrooms were coming to an end.
 Lernea spent a few moments staring at Theo's rising and falling chest,
 hypnotized by the waves of the sea chiming in on tune.
 She was frowning once more, her mind seeking refuge in memories of old.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've met danger together.
 Narrowly escaped death.
 I thought you'd think better of me by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said in earnest.
 She smiled playfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

True enough,

 A lady, even in the guise of an animal, that admitted to making vulgar

A ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied and put a hand above her eyes, searching for a sail, a mast,

 The creaking grew louder; it was as if the ship was riding past them.
 Theo's light snoring could not hope to match it.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo managed to sent with a gasp to Lernea and Theo both, while the ship
 ran aground heedlessly, kicking up wet sand violently all around its prow.
 Noone had time to move, but nevertheless the ship came to a jarring, abrubt
 halt with a grinding noise reminiscent of millstones and sliding tomb doors.
 Nobody was hurt, but they nonetheless couldn't pry their eyes of the ship's
 prow.
 There was a bronze-and-marble statuette of a luscious half-gorgon, half-mermaid
 decorating it.
 It was voluptuously sculpted, sexually suggestive and quite terrible to
 behold.

 leather and skin.

 said a scruffy-looking old man that appeared by the ship's railing.
 He was wearing what appeared to be more than a slightly used horned metal
 cap on his head and a tattered old shirt and pants of an indiscriminate
 nature and original color.
 A rather musky old beard hung from his face down to his waist; what looked
 like tiny barnacles clung on strands of it, as if their life depended on
 it.
 There was a wooden parrot that appeared physically and permanently attached
 to his shoulder.
 It was also quite emphatically dead, judging as it didn't breathe nor move.

 The old man who quite closely resembled a rather out-of-luck, struggling

Lernea felt let down.
 She was hoping there'd be a silver lining in all that mess of a situation.
 Bo whispered in her mind, even if there was no real need to do so:

There was a slight hint of paranoia right there; if the Ygg had reached
 out wherever this place was, Lernea thought to herself, their agents would've
 realised who they were talking to by now.
 More to the point, she reasoned, if that old geezer was working for the
 Ygg, they were indeed a sad, hopeless, desperate lot.

 wary.

 Lernea said aloud to make sure the old pirate would hear.

 but there was no-one there.
 He nodded to himself, shrugged and said to no-one in particular:

Mr.

 a decidedly abnormal mass.
 It splashed into the sea audibly with a plop.

Parcifal's stare had the quality of solid ice; it was cold and opaque.
 She stood on the deck like a statue would, Encelados firmly clasped in

 He cleared his throat and pointed at the blade.

 Parcifal replied icily and staring blankly at the rosy-red sky.
 Thick, puffy clouds passed them by, while below them a green tapestry inched

 Roads and bridges, the roofs of houses small and big.

 Tark said trying to smile thinly, his words carefully selected and his
 voice pitched so as to get the message through in a nice yet slightly irritated
 manner.
 Parcifal did not bat an eyelid or budge an inch.
 She simply spared Tark a fleeting glance as a warning.

 Ned interjected, seeing the first signs of a discussion evolving into a
 fight.
 And Ned knew there had been more than one on their way to Pi Gamma Mu,
 a reasonably peaceful planet of the Human League.
 The fights usually involved Parcifal and Tark, and they were mostly resolved
 before anyone got physically hurt by either Ned or Judith.
 Winceham was either sleeping, having a smoke, or not having a bath most
 of the time.
 His decidedly neutral disposition had earned him a sort of invisible attribute
 to the rest, slightly ineffectual when the air shifted.

It is a matter of principle, Mr.

 he added and turned his back on everyone without another word.
 Parcifal remained silent, unperturbed.
 Her mind was fixated on what really mattered; the whereabouts and fate
 of her sister.
 She knew Lernea was alive, that much she felt as well.
 But where, and for how long, she couldn't answer.
 Those uncertainties gnawed at her soul; it wasn't good for her disposition
 either.
 There was a constant ire, an anger at everything and everyone.
 What she wouldn't freely admit but knew in her heart, was that she blamed
 herself, more than anything.
 After all, she was still a princess of Nomos, Captain of the Guard.
 She had failed her queen, putting her in harm's way.

Absorbed in thought, it took her a while to realise Judith was watching

 Judith stared at her for another moment before she obliged her wishes and
 walked away in silence.
 Parcifal's gaze did not follow her.

Ned was conversing with Tark in a low voice; Winceham was sitting comfortably
 at a swiveling, puffy chair, his feet resting at the helm proper.
 The helm moved and rocked as Winceham shuffled his legs, but the ship stayed
 on course.
 That's because the helm, though operational, didn't really do much.
 The ship was an advanced design; among the many utilities and assorted
 paraphernalia, the mysterious thingamajigs and spurious artifacts it carried,
 it was equipped with an autothaumagator, a device that supposedly served
 many purposes, but which it's primary function was to navigate the ship
 safely and without any crew assistance whatsoever.

Maybe you really are good at that,

 Tark said and perhaps for the first time ever genuinely smiled.

 Tark said and looked thoughtful.

Was that supposed to be a witty play on words?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

No.

Judith approached them, nodded to Ned with a slight smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir, we're approaching Rampatur,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and stood there waiting for instructions.
 Tark nodded and his eyes scanned the horizon momentarily, before his eyes
 met the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the white towers and glistening prisms that made up the core of
 Rampatur City were growing closer.
 Like a miniature set built with extreme detail, Rampatur City looked nearly
 perfect and almost fake.
 Yet it was real enough; stretching across both sides of pristine river,
 it a sprawling metropolis with a distinctive melt of architecture from
 many different schools, from almost every part of the Human League.
 A large, tall pyramid-like structure dominated the center of the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stood there wide-eyed, wonderfully fascinated at the rich white, grey
 and golden hues reflecting the mellow green and brown countryside surrounding
 the city.
 He couldn't stop staring; his lips curled in a grin.
 The sight of the approaching city even attracted Parcifal's parsimonious
 stare, but she didn't break her silence.
 She simply stood there, unable to contain the fact that her interest was
 indeed piqued.
 Ned, on the other hand sounded openly ecstatic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What a sight! It's so grandiose.
 So majestic!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just a backwater planet's capital.
 It's quite rustic, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a scoff.
 He then turned and faced the helm abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ship, send a hail message to the Directorate Office.
 Be sure to include the word `pumpkin', capitalized.
 Negotiate a mooring with Rampatur Aerial and bring us in for landing.
 What was that nice place on Rampatur Central?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I have an index of three hundred and nineteen topographical entities in

 Stimulate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the female voice demanded softly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The one where they put olives in that drink,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said with some mild annoyance.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stimulate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the ship repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never mind.
 Find an exorbitantly-priced restaurant.
 Book a table for five.
 Make sure to ask for privacy.
 And put it on the expenses list,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said raising a finger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thaumaturgizing your request,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 voiced the ship in mellifluous tones.
 Tark turned to face Ned once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Excellent.
 We'll be landing shortly, Mr.
 Larkin.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You made dinner reservations?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked him.
 Tark stared at him for a moment before sceding an answer with a slightly
 confused look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and his answer sounded a lot like a question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you reserved a table for five.
 Does that mean you're offering a night out? Like a welcoming gift?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said smiling a bit awkwardly, always a polite smile on his lips.
 He could see Parcifal fidgeting uncomfortably near the ship's prow, as
 if itching to get off the

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Good gracious, no!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark exclaimed with a polite little laugh.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would've been impertinent to say the least.
 Quite frankly, whatever gave you that idea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark was looking at Ned from head to toe; what Ned implied sounded almost
 absurd.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been in the field for months.
 I'm having a blast tonight.
 All sorts of debauchery in mind, if you must know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wasn't asking about details, but what about us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned demanded with a sharp frown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Judith will handle your lot.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does that mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It means you need to co-operate and everything will be fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squinted as he gazed towards the city, a hand over his eyes.
 From the right point of view, the setting sun did not blind but rather
 painted the round-topped towers with a rosy, pinkish sheen.
 Ned's answer came with a heavy, slow nod of his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll co-operate alright.
 Just as long as we're treated fair and proper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and made sure to stress the last word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and pointed at Parcifal, looking at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal is strong-willed and proud.
 She's like a hurt, caged animal right now.
 You never know when she might lash out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and shrugged.
 Tark took him by one shoulder and nearly whispered in his ear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As a word of advice, don't act the fool with Intelligence.
 You're not Human League citizens; you'll be granted a provisional status
 upon landing.
 And that halfuin friend of yours.
 He'll be in trouble.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you mean? What kind of trouble?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said sounding alarmed and rightly so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see he's humanoid, not human standard.
 He will be considered an illegal alien,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised an eyebrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Winceham? He might be old and smell bad because he never takes a bath, but
 he's not an alien!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not the official take on the matter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned slightly around to see Parcifal; it appeared as if
 he was checking up on her.
 He saw Judith was busy making last minute checks to her inventory, all
 neatly stacked and tied down to the deck.
 Ned's voice was filled with sudden angst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why didn't you say so before?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It would have been pointless, really.
 There was no place to drop him off,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied with a smug little grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And now there is? Treating halfuins like aliens.
 Aren't there any short people in the Human League?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's an entirely different subject.
 I don't make policy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squatted, reaching for a metal box near the helm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're on the clock.
 I'm doing you a great favor just by letting you know.
 It could get me into a lot of trouble.
 Lose my job, get shot.
 I'm talking that kind of trouble,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sounded positively serious even though the grin would not leave
 his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You won't buy us dinner, but you're willing to risk getting shot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's not get all chummy all of a sudden,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised one finger with one hand while he rummaged inside
 the metal box with the other.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dinner is one thing; getting shot is a professional perk anyway.
 I like to think of it as extending a little bit of professional courtesy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said looking up to Ned with a smile.
 In his hands he held what looked like a small backpack or rather a large
 bag with straps and whatnot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I'm a performer.
 You're a..
 Spy, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked with a good measure of uncertainty.
 To his knowledge, spies were vermin-like people, all cloak and dagger that
 you'd never guess in a million years what they did for a living.
 On the other hand, Tark was practically shouting it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Things seldom are the way they appear to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and perfunctorily gave the bag a look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not a spy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you seriously expecting me to answer that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said while wearing the bag on his back.
 It was black and somewhat rotund.
 A pair of red lines made of stitches ran its length; they were made to
 look like lightning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Tark said grinning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't look tailor-made,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and made a sour face of disbelief.
 Tark replied without hinting at any sort of being annoyed or indeed being
 called a retard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Tark paused for a moment and gave the question some thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wouldn't know about that.
 I'm not the one making up the names.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, what does it do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned asked, voicing some genuine interest in what appeared to be little
 more than a bag with a strange colour scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked conversationally.
 He shrugged vaguely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, there's no magic involved.
 It's a simple aetheric device.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

You mean like, involving aether science?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's what the big-heads in VV-section told me, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied, fastening a pair of straps around his waist.
 Ned's gaze seemed drawn to the retardation device.
 After a couple of moments of scrutiny, Ned asked poignantly with one hand
 resting under his chin, to add even more thoughtfulness into his words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What if that fails?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Tark blinked thoughtfully in silence before staring at Ned with a very particula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There's always religion, I'm told,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and walked past Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked him with a tint of curiosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to jump,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and made a jumping gesture with both hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were coming along,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and took a few steps closer to Tark, with his hands crossed over
 his chest.
 He was pouting slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, no.
 I'm not even supposed to be on this ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said grinning profusely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

So, you're hiding as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hiding is a harsh term.
 Obfuscating one's wherabouts is much more preferable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It still means you're hiding.
 Winceham will be forced to go into hiding as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Look, I really need to jump.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I need you to do me a favor,

 Ned said and touched Tark on the shoulder, smiling lightly.
 Tark noticed the gesture and sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is strictly business.
 Nothing personal to all of this, do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned his back on Ned.
 He grasped the railing and was preparing to really jump overboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't jump just yet if I were you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said, tapping Tark's shoulder profusely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Sweetness of a maiden's tit! What is it now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark yelled with aggravation.
\end_layout

Winceham jumped in that glorified parachute of yours a while ago.

He did?Then what am I wearing exactly?

His backpack,

 Ned said with a beaming smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Why didn't I notice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark asked, looking at the backpack's straps mundanely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Misdirection, mostly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said as if it should have been obvious.
 Tark stepped away from the railing and took off the backpack.
 He opened it hastily and found nothing but a half-eaten mushroom salad
 sandwich along with a note that read:

Did you know about this?

 Tark said and his stared turned sour when he pointed a finger at Judith

It's not her fault, Tark.

I might be able to,

 Tark admitted, raising an eyebrow.

As an added incentive, Winceham's got your money pouch.

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and his lip stiffened.

No need to worry; he has enough sense to leave some of that money for dinner.

I'm not sure if you're in the right line of business,

The ship was the Mary Drunkard; a twelve-gun fast runner, light and deadly
 as a hawk when it first was put to sea.
 Three hundred and twenty three years later though, it was a small miracle
 or perhaps even a feat of magic that vessel still remained afloat.
 Anyone who could afford a bit of common sense would have bet an arm and
 a leg that a ship filled with gaping holes and made out of maggot-infested,
 rotten wood would happily sink away like a rock.
 The few unlucky souls who made those kinds of bets gave a small bump in
 the always-in-demand, but never-really-breaking-it-big, prosthetics industry.

The original owner, a rich eccentric drunkard that liked to spend his vast

Lernea looked skeptical, while Theo sported a withdrawn expression, thoughtful
 to the point of weariness.
 It had everything to do with the gameboard he was glued to, its multi-coloured
 tiles and many pieces too much for the untrained eye.

 Lernea suggested at one point and inched a finger closer to one piece.
 Theo stopped her in her tracks with a single, wild-eyed glance.
 She drew her hand back onto her lap, where Bo sat, her bunny eyes going
 back and forth between Theo and the captain, as if a tiny spark was all
 that was needed to ignite a deadly silence into a veritable mayhem.
 But all they were doing was sitting comfortably around a table, sipping
 some tea and playing Po.

 Captain Van der Breckenrod asked with an abruptly aroused suspicion, holding
 his chin up; the pipe in his mouth followed suit and remained stuck upwards
 as it glowed, ember-red after he drew heavily on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Po,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Theo without skipping a beat or breaking his concentration.
 The Captain looked around him for a moment, looked at the table and let
 the smoke out of his nostrils.
 A small cloud hovered between him and Theo before he finally rolled his
 eyes and as if waking from a dream, fluttered his eyelids and said,

Of course, Po!

Bo fidgeted and couldn't sit still.
 She had been growing more and more nervous by the minute.
 She voiced to Lernea and Theo, for their minds alone:

Lernea tried to control her breathing; her face jerked slightly, involuntarily,
 as if something had bitten her.
 She picked up Bo and looked her in the eyes, those wonderfully red-hued
 bunny eyes with the propensity to spout fiery wrath when she was provoked.
 Bo looked rather adorable in her fluffy white bunny form, and Lernea was
 a young woman of noble heart, scion to a kingdom and very lady-like, good
 and proper in her manners, just and swift with her bow.
 But she was an inch closer to actually breaking the bunny's neck, and Bo
 could feel she was at the edge of a chasm.

Let's just say, for the sake of argument, you were afraid, for some reason
 - well-founded or not - afraid a particular set of events might occur in
 the future.
 Like taking an arrow to your knee that prevented you from living the life
 of an adventurer.
 Or some stranger you just met was awfully weird and had really bad bladder
 control on top of a drinking problem that made you suspicious of him.
 That man would not constitute a let's say, clear and present danger against
 your person, without showing overt aggresiveness in the form of killing
 you outright, in your sleep, or at least trying to throw you overboard
 to the killer whales now.
 In which I would be more than happy to do something about it to the best
 of my ability.
 Seeing though, as there isn't any evidence to support such a claim, I would
 be remiss to not point out that going on and on about a hypothetical situation
 without any basis on reality \SpecialChar \-
 bent as it may be under certain circumstances
 \SpecialChar \-
 can drive a person mad.
 It would thus be, by any account, not unlikely for a person under duress
 to be driven into acts of temporary insanity as can be proven under law,
 to which extent said person might not be held liable for his actions and
 be set free.
 Wouldn't you agree, overall, gentlemen?

 Lernea said without tearing her eyes away from Bo who sat perfectly still,
 soaking in what was mostlty intended for her ears.

Captain Van der Breckenrod looked at Lernea sideways for a moment and then
 looked at the glass in his hand.
 There was a little tiny piece of handicraft floating in it, an umbrella
 \SpecialChar \-
 or some would argue, a parasol \SpecialChar \-
 and it was slowly sinking in the dark,
 cherry red mixture of unidentifiable alcohol and rum.
 He downed the glass in one go, frowned heavily for a while, checked the
 bottom of the glass for signs of more liquor and then turned and told Lernea,
 the tiny umbrella still stuck on his beard:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I, for one, Miss Testarossa, am agreed.
 I am quite agreeable a person, after all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and threw away the tiny umbrella with the intention of sending
 it overboard.
 Instead, it somehow flew around in circles and settled on Theo's hair,
 who was too pre-occupied with planning his next move to afford the most
 perfunctory of looks.
 He did nod though, but only to himself in relation to a possible move he
 was contemplating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That's quite alright, Mr.

 Silence is after all, a common indicator of approval.

 Lernea said and Bo seemed to nod imperceptibly.
 She remained silent indeed, and almost looked prudish somehow.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, if my crew is any indication, you are spot on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the old pirate said and raised his glass.
 It was pretty soon floating mid-air in the direction of the ramshackle
 captain's cabin.
 Lernea had noticed a lot of that was going on around the ship; sails hoisting
 themselves, ropes being tied up as if by way of magic, giant waterproof
 holes in the hull.
 Yet it had nothing to do with magic, or else Bo would have at least a real
 possible threat to take into account.
 It had to do with ghosts and Theo was the only who could not just see them
 but talk to them as well.
 It had something to do with Rho, the ever-present life force of sorts that
 existed in everything living.
 Somehow, that even involved the undead.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Still, a skeleton crew, no pun intended.

I mean, it's just you and what was it, three ghosts?

 she said and Theo nodded reassuringly to her.
 He had made his move and thus was now aware of what was Lernea was saying.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You've been lost at sea for fifteen years.

 the captain said nodding.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Sometimes though, I do wake up and see what's for breakfast and I wish I
 were dead, yes.
 But then I'm reminded I might end up as ghost crew in a ghost ship and
 I just know the kind of heartless bastards that run those ships,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and gave the main mast an angry, crazed stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That brings me back to my senses,

 he said and took a swig from his pipe before moving a pawn shaped like
 an extravagantly built windmill to a blue tile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and reshuffled himself in his seat.
 He was rather more quiet than his usual self.
 He hadn't raised many questions since he had woken up, and he had made
 no mention of Tejwel, the bear involved in whatever that thing they blew
 up in Tallyflop was.
 Theo must've thought him a real friend indeed, judging by the way he so
 easily and quite impressively killed the Ygg as if they were nothing more
 than monsters.
 It had certainly had some effect on him; he suddenly appeared grim and
 boring, all grown-up.
 Even the game they had been playing seemed utterly drab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is interesting exactly? I haven't heard of this game before.
 All I see is a mosaic of tiles on an irregularly shaped board, and lots
 of different pieces made out of practically anything solid.
 Not to mention you've been playing for four hours straight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat up straight in the utilitarian stool.
 She produced a comb out of a small vest pocket, and began combing her hair.
 Apart from not doing much to rectify the sad affair that her hair had been
 reduced to, the combing had the deleterious effect of grains of sand falling
 onto the gameboard with a rasping, cluttering sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could you do that someplace else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said while the captain extended a hand blindly to receive his flying,
 refilled glass of the cocktail he was drinking, complete with a tiny umbrella
 and everything, up to and including a slice of pineapple.
 Lernea looked at Theo and noticed his stare wasn't the usual bland-eyed
 stare he seemed to confront the world at large with; it had a purpose and
 a hint of ire this time.
 She stopped combing her hair and apologised, though she hadn't expected
 anyone to notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 roughly shaping up a sphere in the air.

I thought games were supposed to be fun,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was looking at the pirate intently, ears standing
 tall and upright like antennae.
 Though she remained silent, Lernea felt she was ready to absorb everything
 the captain was saying.
 Theo, on the other hand, was looking at the gameboard with a heavy frown,
 too absorbed in planning his strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They have to be fun, so people will want to play them.
 Do keep in mind, people's idea of fun differs greatly.
 For instance, Mr.

 throw away all the navigating equipment.

Lernea nodded with a frown, while the captain let the barbed comment sink
 in.
 After seemingly observing a moment of silence, the captain spoke again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're not having that discussion, again, Mr.
 Gunadeer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said flatly and drew on the pipe.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see, Ms.
 Testarossa, fun and games can be quite productive past-times.
 The risk-taking, the strategy involved, the planning, the logistics of
 the thing, your opponent and his idea of you, your idea of him..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and straightened the dead parrot on his shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that's detailed enough, it's like war and all that fighting that goes
 on and on everywhere.
 But if you play it out first, in something as innocuous looking as this
 little board of Po, it might show you an advantageous situation, a way
 out of trouble or a way in.
 A winning strategy, or the cost of defeat.
 It's more of a tool, Po.
 It has the added benefit it's pretty hard to injure yourself.
 Unlike swordfighting.

\begin_layout Standard

So in essence, it's like Zatrik,

 Both the captain and Theo were instantly adamant in their rebuttal.

\begin_layout Standard

No need to get excited.

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was nowhere to be seen.
 Which was quite unsettling knowing she could flame her eyes up in a split
 second and start fireballing everything for no apparent reason.
 Adding her latest streak of paranoia did not help either.

 Theo said and looked around him, the tiny umbrella still stuck in his dreadlock
s.
 The fog was clearing up; the first purely golden rays of sun shafted through
 from above.
 It was as if someone had delineated an invisible line on some grandiose
 map, where one side was all grey and bland and the other side was shiny,
 green and sported cute depictions of butterflies and cupids.
 It looked like the ship had just passed it and emerged on the fancy, nice

 eyes slightly glowing orange, not unlike tiny beacons.

 Bo sent to Lernea's mind with a sigh.
 It seemed like the perfect answer to Lernea for a moment; her mind was
 indeed elsewhere.

Her gaze wandered up and down the coastline that unfurled itself graciously.
 The sun was almost noon-high, shining with all its might.
 Its warmth was a pleasant contrast to the icy fresh breeze; they were still
 somewhere cold but at least there was warmth to be found in the daylight.
 At the farthest reaches, Lernea could still make out large rocky cliffs
 and islets.
 A spatter of snow and ice hugged their tops.
 But the way the ship was pointed, they were sailing straight for a small
 bay, surround by golden and brown thickets.
 In the distance beyond, a hilly terrain formed, slightly sloping into the
 grey phantom vision of a mountain ridge.
 What was more telling, she could see thin columns of smoke rising up from
 the bay.

The walls of the Marvellously Rotund and Equivocally Reassuring Grandiose
 Officious Hall of Endearment were basically rotund and ostensible too large
 for the common eye to perceive.
 Yet it was simply one of many similar halls \SpecialChar \-
 if not in name certainly in
 capacity \SpecialChar \-
 dotted around the Naval Intelligence Bureau building in Rampatur
 City, itself one of many government buildings of varied shape and uniformly
 huge size to be found in the very center of the city.
 From the outside, the Naval Intelligence building looked like an even,
 totally opaque block from which a huge flag of the Human League was unfurled,
 drooping over the north face, above the diminutive revolving door entrance.
 It was identical to any other government building and noone in Rampatur
 seemed to pay it the least amount of notice, even if everything it shadowed
 was made cooler.
 As in, the temperature dropped because of the huge shadow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hall boasted some soft lighting in the form of a couple of unseen spotlights
; Ned, Tark, Judith and Parcifal were standing under guard.
 Four men in full body armor, boasting elaborately ornate halberds that
 sported some sort of exotic machinery on them were keeping an eye on all
 of them.
 The ridiculously coloured suit came with a number of silly-looking hats
 being worn one on top of another, as well as any number of a variety of
 feathers adorning them.
 There were also a number of medals and bones hanging from the guards' breastpla
te armor.
 If anything at all, they looked like some sort of very state-of-the-art
 laughable jokers armed with nonetheless sharp instruments of bleeding death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood emotionless, with a cold, calculating gaze.
 Ned was wary; he felt the whole situation was akin to a very tight balancing
 rope act, without a safety net, and razor sharp spikes on either side of
 the terminal drop.
 Tark was looking smug and confident in a very stylish, simple yet exotic
 suit of black cloth with matching smart pants and soft, spongy shoulder
 pads that made him look pretty suave.
 Judith was weary, fidgeting in her tight leather suit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In front of them, at what was probably judged to be a safe but not too impractic
al distance sat the Impromptu Intelligent Committee on Matters of Intelligence
 Missions Gathering Intelligence and Whatnot.
 There was even a wooden sign carved with those exact words sitting on a
 bleak, wooden desk where the members of the Committee rested their crossed
 hands.
 They were all dressed in non-descript white robes.
 Only the older man among them wore a fine-wrought silver chain around his
 neck from where a small curio hang.
 Their desk was filled with all manner of scrolls, maps, and papers which
 were being scrutinised.
 The sound of shuffling papers reverberated accross the gigantic empty space
 of the hall which appeared to have, oddly enough, excellent acoustics.

 You've wasted hundreds of thousands of Bureau timeshares, gallivanting

 Judith said following a curt nod.

If you'll excuse us,

Well, that's actually a good idea.

They left the ghost ship with its skeleton crew in a nearby alcove, protected
 from view by the steep, sharp mossy cliffs.
 From then on the walk to the village was an easy, refreshing trip which
 they began as soon as they set foot on land.
 Lernea offered thanks and praise to Svarna for guiding her home, and kissed
 the ground, quickly realising the picture in her mind did not match the
 taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The salty breeze mingled with the smells of green grass and mush, wet ground.
 It brought a heartfelt smile to Lernea to be back home, even under the
 very unusual circumstances.
 And it was a true wonder in itself that her mentor, friend and caretaker,
 the man who had been to her more than the grandfather she had never met,
 was alive and well, despite what she had seen with her eyes.

Theo felt the cold climate bite at his linen robes.
 The southern seas were warm, and space had been generously temperate and
 comfortable.
 But the northern reaches of Nomos offered a cold, harsh climate, suitable
 for the hardy locals, but not so friendly to anyone else.
 Except Bo who was covered in fur and was quite excited at the prospect
 of munching on northern, exotic grass; brushes were rare and flowers even
 rarer, but they provided a challenge with interesting, mouth-filling rewards.
 She delightfully hopped along, sampling what freshness the outdoors of
 Nomos had to offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was decidedly not asking Sisyphus a lot of questions; she was content
 knowing that there was time enough to get up to date on matters of importance.
 And there were quite a lot of those, Master Sisyphus had told her, but
 his philosophy was that the slow, careful approach, always offered more
 time to think and analyse.
 Those in turn, offered more choices of action, and considerably more ways
 of egress out of nasty situations.
 Which was, how he had by a combination of good fortune and clever planning,
 avoided turning into a crisp.

You'd be surprised how much heat the body generates.

You might be my queen, and I might have taught you since your childhood,

Winceham? That's an interesting name.
 Somehow makes me feel hungry,

 mused Master Sisyphus.
 Lernea added with a soft voice:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Parcifal is with them.
 Only Svarna knows where they are now.
 At least, I think they're safe.
 Last I saw them, they were flying away in a ship, trying to flee a scene
 of terrible destruction.
 It was nothing like I had ever thought possible, Master.
 You should have seen it, you would know better.

I was referring to the Teletha sisters,

 Master Sisyphus said, eying Theo with a powerful frown that made the elf
 shy away.
 Master Sisyphus whispered to Lernea then:

Is he really a sorcerer?

 Lernea replied and Master Sisyphus' face became contorted as if the world

We need to know more about her.
 Can she talk?

I bet she's telling you something right now, isn't she?

 Master Sisyphus asked, but before Lernea had time to make up an answer,
 he provided one himself:
