\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a sinister threat lurking in the cosmos.
 It is a dark, sticky as tar and far worse than mouldy cheese.
 It reaches in places you would never believe or feel comfortable with;
 its livid tendrils sneakily out to get everything that's fair and beautiful
 around us, even unicorns.
 I must do as my conscience bids me; I must fight to expose their ill-doings
 and bring them down once and for all.
 There's a lot of danger involved which means I'll probably die or go mad
 in the process.
 But I have to do this, for the sake of my children alone.
 And perhaps all the things I find dear in the world, like Taem berries.
 And roast veeb.
 Perhaps, Rovenii mead and Yule beer as well.
 Just thinking about what is at stake here, makes me ravenous.

\begin_layout Quotation
-- Athmoor Radaniel, from his personal journal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea felt her face set against something wet and grainy.
 As if caught in the moment between wakefulness and sleep, her mind felt
 numb, soft and muddy.
 A word popped in her head: Sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wet sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her face was half-buried in a patch of wet sand.
 There was a feeling of cold water splashing against her body every now
 and then.
 Maybe it was time to go to the latrine she thought to herself, but quickly
 realised it was the feeling of waves embracing her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A beach then, she came to realise and opened her eyes half-expecting everything
 to be a dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no silken bedding around her, no morning sun's glory behind laced
 curtains; just a misty, fog-laden beach with low, crumbled rock outcroppings
 in the hazy distance which wasn't much of a distance at all.
 The sun was hidden behind a grim overcast sky.
 Lazy grey clouds barely seemed to move.
 A harsh, cold salty breeze made her face flush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw the white bunny rabbit to her right, the way her head lay; Bo was
 munching on a small brush of saltweed when she looked her way as if enabled
 by some sixth or even seventh sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good, you're awake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words rang crystal clear in Lernea's head; she was instantly confused.
 It was a woman's voice, warm and cheerful.
 Her first thought was she had either bumped her head somewhere along the
 way or had gone mad.
 Voices in her head were more than she could cope with - it was the worst
 time to check her sanity levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's alright.
 It's me, Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said while Bo munched away, seemingly possessed by a real appetite
 for destroying saltweed bushes.
 Lernea squinted at the bunny with a puzzled, weary look.
 For all she knew and cared for, a talking bunny made as much sense as a
 magical, fire-spouting one.
 What felt weird was Bo appeared to be female.
 That wasn't a life-threatening situation, Lernea knew; she'd just come
 out of one alive and well.
 And quite wet, she added as an afterthought.
 She sighed and suddenly wished for a steamy hot cup of Chamoleon: she could
 almost smell it too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised her head slightly above the wet sand and felt a sudden, awful
 dizziness.
 She remembered the drop into that churning nightmarish fire and the flash;
 a bright, blinding flash.
 She remembered Theo falling right behind her, clasping her hand and Bo's
 eyes flaring up as as if the small white bunny would explode with a hail
 of brimstone and fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She dug her hands in the sand and propped herself up; her shoulders felt
 sore.
 She looked to her left and saw Theo laying there, his back against a patch
 of damp sand with arms splayed and eyes closed, where the waves would barely
 lick his body.
 Her mind flashed with a horrifying thought; she felt her stomach tie itself
 in a knot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's just sleeping.
 He was actually snoring a little while back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can read minds now as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Lernea audibly, with just the right amount of annoyance in her
 voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, it's not that hard to tell what crossed your mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and dug her rabbit body under a rocky ledge where the wind seemed
 to die down and sat there snugly.
 Lernea replied with a stare and a scoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She drove a hand through her hair reflexively; it was a ragged mess with
 pieces of seaweed clunging on like little green braids.
 Her leather bodice was soaking wet and her boots made squishy sounds.
 She felt wet and miserable, her only measure of relief the reassuring weight
 of her bow strung against her back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aren't you cold? At all?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked her timidly; her little bunny body shivered involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am the rightful Queen of Nomos, the Kingdom of the North,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied in a stern voice.
 She felt better just by saying that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So, you're accustomed to this cold, I take it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know, Theo would need to ask something as obvious as that.
 Are you two related, by chance?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actually, Theo is my brother,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and even in Lernea's mind her voice had an awkward feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea raised an eyebrow and took a long, hard stare at Bo.
 Then she shook her head and looked at Theo, silver-haired with a touch
 of blond, the wet, ragged dreadlocks adorning his elven face with all the
 grace of a mop.
 She burst out laughing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're funny! Better than Ned!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm serious.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo's words nearly made Lernea's mind feel a bit heavier with all the weight
 the voice carried suddenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea blinked furiously as if something were caught in her eye.
 Her face became taut suddenly; she stared back at the sea like a castaway
 waiting for a ship that'd never sail by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned.
 And Parcifal.
 They're not here, are they?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and walked over to Theo, vague moulds of her boots trailing behind
 her on the impressionable sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Neither is Winceham,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo voiced.
 Lernea shot her a frowned look and paused mid-stride.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The weird, short fellow.
 Don't you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked with a hint of worry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Halfuin, really.
 I remember.
 I'm not really sure what exactly happened, that's all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat down beside Theo, legs crossed.
 Locks of her hair were stuck against her face.
 She looked to windward, her arms laid back against the sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you want the short version, or the long version?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wager we're not in a hurry.
 If someone wanted us dead, they'd done it by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shouldn't we wake Theo up as well? He might want to hear all this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added as an afterthought.
 Bo twitched her nose and hopped towards the sea, soaking her bunny feet
 in some wet sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He gets a bit antsy if you wake him up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said in Lernea's mind.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's kind of groggy and slow-minded for a while afterwards,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added and backed away playfully from a slightly frothing wave.
 Bo seemed to be having some kind of fun, despite it all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For a while? Like what, a whole day?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a sneer.
 Bo turned her bunny head uncannily towards Lernea; her eyes seemed to brighten
 up a little - it was a reflex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hey, that's not nice,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she sent to Lernea's mind; there was some sadness involved, rather than
 anger.
 Lernea looked at Bo for a moment and closed her eyes.
 Right beside her, Theo could be heard, snoring lightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean it like that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and awkwardly ran a finger in the sand, drawing random curves
 and shapes.
 Bo seemed satisfied; the bunny's eyes lost their glint and she turned to
 look at the sea once more, her head bobbing slightly as if mesmerized by
 the waves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's true though, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said after a while.
 The bunny looked at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, he can be a little daft sometimes.
 But he did save us,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and hopped merrily towards Theo and snuggled right beside his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He did? I thought that was you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied, genuinely surprised to hear that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tried, but there wasn't much I could do other than put a shield around
 us.
 The wormhole that brought us her in the nick of time, that was Theo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a while, Lernea stared at Theo as if in shock.
 The sound of waves dying a few feet away rose easily above the eerie silence.
 Bo blinked at Lernea without saying a word.
 Overhead, a sea bird of some kind croaked.
 It drew Lernea's stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was goofy with magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, whatever he did, trust me; it wasn't magic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and wiggled her nose.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo is magically inert.
 Has been ever since I can remember,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the bunny said and dug its face in Theo's sand-ridden dreadlocks, before
 pulling it out again sharply - as if it smelled something unruly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought he was a sorcerer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He seemed to be; well, kind of.
 Sometimes at least,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added shrugging, sounding clearly confused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 I just made it appear so; I'm the sorceress in the family,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and her bunny eyes flared up with a tinge of red flame that was
 snuffed out the next instant, just to illustrate her point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just for appearances?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked.
 Bo leapt above Theo's slowly rising and falling chest and perched herself
 on top of a mass of rocks.
 She stood straight up and looked around, surveying the misty landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The woodkin knew.
 I have a soft spot for Theo, what can I say? I thought it was prudent as
 well.
 Magical bunnies aren't a dime a dozen - if word got out..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo let the words echo faintly in Lernea's mind.
 She gave Bo a weird squinting look - it was her calculating, thinking look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're in hiding, aren't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's right.
 Have been for years.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

From who? Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have no idea.
 Just the words of my father, ringing in my head,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent to Lernea and paused, sniffing the air.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hide.
 That's all I can remember.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think I can relate to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a shallow voice.
 Her face flushed red, remembering how she and Parcifal were cast out, humiliate
d, to be excised from memory, from history even.
 As they never had existed.
 She bit her lip and her mind turned to the quandary at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then how did he do whatever it was he did that saved us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea asked and pointed at Theo, looking baffled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The wormhole? I haven't got the slightest idea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo said and uncannily shook her head slowly like a human would.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Same goes about the place we've ended up at,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she added, her nose twitching faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It could've been worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and stood up.
 A cold breeze snapped against her hard, lean face.
 She felt invigorated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We could have been charred to the bone or flash-steamed into space, that's
 true,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and began scouring the sand and rock for signs of moss or something
 generally green and edible.
 She sniffed profusely, like only a sort of herbivore hound would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I mean, this place could have been worse.
 Far worse.
 It however kind of feels..
 Homely,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said after pausing to find the word.
 She cleaned some of the sand off her pants, but the majority of the grains
 mostly clung on heedless.
 Bo's eyes widened and she turned her bunny head around at an impossible
 angle - anyone passing by would have been horrified by the unnatural movement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's homely about this cold, wet place? I can barely see what's out there.
 And as far as I can see there's nothing but rocks - not even a tint of
 moss.
 The sun is hidden - there is no way to tell the time.
 It's moody and grey, suggestive of a rainy afternoon without the rain.
 It's \SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Kind of like home, indeed,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This place reminds you of home?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked Lernea, the thought echoing with a positively unenthused quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Reminds me of Thraka; the northern reaches.
 My sister and I spent a whole summer there when we were kids.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Must've been a lovely summer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo sent and dug in a shadowy cleft where lo and behold, a cluster of mushrooms
 lay.
 She began nibbling at them after barely shooting them a peremptory look.
 They didn't seem poisonous, at first glance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was; we went whale fishing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied.
 Bo was focused on the mushrooms, making sure to eat just the caps; she
 never did like the stems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was being sarcastic but never mind.
 Whale fishing, you say? Just how old were you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Twelve.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What kind of kids go whale hunting?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We were rarely, if ever, normal kids, even by Nomos' standards.
 We were born to become queens, mind you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was under the vague impression that queens go for croquet and tea parties,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and somehow her thoughts conveyed a sense of insatiable hunger,
 even while the mushrooms were coming to an end.
 Lernea spent a few moments staring at Theo's rising and falling chest,
 hypnotized by the waves of the sea chiming in on tune.
 She was frowning once more, her mind seeking refuge in memories of old.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've met danger together.
 Narrowly escaped death.
 I thought you'd think better of me by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said in earnest.
 She smiled playfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

True enough,

 A lady, even in the guise of an animal, that admitted to making vulgar

A ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied and put a hand above her eyes, searching for a sail, a mast,

 The creaking grew louder; it was as if the ship was riding past them.
 Theo's light snoring could not hope to match it.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Bo managed to sent with a gasp to Lernea and Theo both, while the ship
 ran aground heedlessly, kicking up wet sand violently all around its prow.
 Noone had time to move, but nevertheless the ship came to a jarring, abrubt
 halt with a grinding noise reminiscent of millstones and sliding tomb doors.
 Nobody was hurt, but they nonetheless couldn't pry their eyes of the ship's
 prow.
 There was a bronze-and-marble statuette of a luscious half-gorgon, half-mermaid
 decorating it.
 It was voluptuously sculpted, sexually suggestive and quite terrible to
 behold.

 leather and skin.

 said a scruffy-looking old man that appeared by the ship's railing.
 He was wearing what appeared to be more than a slightly used horned metal
 cap on his head and a tattered old shirt and pants of an indiscriminate
 nature and original color.
 A rather musky old beard hung from his face down to his waist; what looked
 like tiny barnacles clung on strands of it, as if their life depended on
 it.
 There was a wooden parrot that appeared physically and permanently attached
 to his shoulder.
 It was also quite emphatically dead, judging as it didn't breathe nor move.

 The old man who quite closely resembled a rather out-of-luck, struggling

Lernea felt let down.
 She was hoping there'd be a silver lining in all that mess of a situation.
 Bo whispered in her mind, even if there was no real need to do so:

There was a slight hint of paranoia right there; if the Ygg had reached
 out wherever this place was, Lernea thought to herself, their agents would've
 realised who they were talking to by now.
 More to the point, she reasoned, if that old geezer was working for the
 Ygg, they were indeed a sad, hopeless, desperate lot.

 wary.

 Lernea said aloud to make sure the old pirate would hear.

 but there was no-one there.
 He nodded to himself, shrugged and said to no-one in particular:

Mr.

 a decidedly abnormal mass.
 It splashed into the sea audibly with a plop.

Parcifal's stare had the quality of solid ice; it was cold and opaque.
 She stood on the deck like a statue would, Encelados firmly clasped in

 He cleared his throat and pointed at the blade.

 Parcifal replied icily and staring blankly at the rosy-red sky.
 Thick, puffy clouds passed them by, while below them a green tapestry inched

 Roads and bridges, the roofs of houses small and big.

 Tark said trying to smile thinly, his words carefully selected and his
 voice pitched so as to get the message through in a nice yet slightly irritated
 manner.
 Parcifal did not bat an eyelid or budge an inch.
 She simply spared Tark a fleeting glance as a warning.

 Ned interjected, seeing the first signs of a discussion evolving into a
 fight.
 And Ned knew there had been more than one on their way to Pi Gamma Mu,
 a reasonably peaceful planet of the Human League.
 The fights usually involved Parcifal and Tark, and they were mostly resolved
 before anyone got physically hurt by either Ned or Judith.
 Winceham was either sleeping, having a smoke, or not having a bath most
 of the time.
 His decidedly neutral disposition had earned him a sort of invisible attribute
 to the rest, slightly ineffectual when the air shifted.

It is a matter of principle, Mr.

 he added and turned his back on everyone without another word.
 Parcifal remained silent, unperturbed.
 Her mind was fixated on what really mattered; the whereabouts and fate
 of her sister.
 She knew Lernea was alive, that much she felt as well.
 But where, and for how long, she couldn't answer.
 Those uncertainties gnawed at her soul; it wasn't good for her disposition
 either.
 There was a constant ire, an anger at everything and everyone.
 What she wouldn't freely admit but knew in her heart, was that she blamed
 herself, more than anything.
 After all, she was still a princess of Nomos, Captain of the Guard.
 She had failed her queen, putting her in harm's way.

Absorbed in thought, it took her a while to realise Judith was watching

 Judith stared at her for another moment before she obliged her wishes and
 walked away in silence.
 Parcifal's gaze did not follow her.

Ned was conversing with Tark in a low voice; Winceham was sitting comfortably
 at a swiveling, puffy chair, his feet resting at the helm proper.
 The helm moved and rocked as Winceham shuffled his legs, but the ship stayed
 on course.
 That's because the helm, though operational, didn't really do much.
 The ship was an advanced design; among the many utilities and assorted
 paraphernalia, the mysterious thingamajigs and spurious artifacts it carried,
 it was equipped with an autothaumagator, a device that supposedly served
 many purposes, but which it's primary function was to navigate the ship
 safely and without any crew assistance whatsoever.

Maybe you really are good at that,

 Tark said and perhaps for the first time ever genuinely smiled.

 Tark said and looked thoughtful.

Was that supposed to be a witty play on words?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

No.

Judith approached them, nodded to Ned with a slight smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir, we're approaching Rampatur,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and stood there waiting for instructions.
 Tark nodded and his eyes scanned the horizon momentarily, before his eyes
 met the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the white towers and glistening prisms that made up the core of
 Rampatur City were growing closer.
 Like a miniature set built with extreme detail, Rampatur City looked nearly
 perfect and almost fake.
 Yet it was real enough; stretching across both sides of pristine river,
 it a sprawling metropolis with a distinctive melt of architecture from
 many different schools, from almost every part of the Human League.
 A large, tall pyramid-like structure dominated the center of the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stood there wide-eyed, wonderfully fascinated at the rich white, grey
 and golden hues reflecting the mellow green and brown countryside surrounding
 the city.
 He couldn't stop staring; his lips curled in a grin.
 The sight of the approaching city even attracted Parcifal's parsimonious
 stare, but she didn't break her silence.
 She simply stood there, unable to contain the fact that her interest was
 indeed piqued.
 Ned, on the other hand sounded openly ecstatic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What a sight! It's so grandiose.
 So majestic!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark sighed.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just a backwater planet's capital.
 It's quite rustic, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a scoff.
 He then turned and faced the helm abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ship, send a hail message to the Directorate Office.
 Be sure to include the word `pumpkin', capitalized.
 Negotiate a mooring with Rampatur Aerial and bring us in for landing.
 What was that nice place on Rampatur Central?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I have an index of three hundred and nineteen topographical entities in

 Stimulate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the female voice demanded softly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The one where they put olives in that drink,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said with some mild annoyance.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stimulate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the ship repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Never mind.
 Find an exorbitantly-priced restaurant.
 Book a table for five.
 Make sure to ask for privacy.
 And put it on the expenses list,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said raising a finger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thaumaturgizing your request,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 voiced the ship in mellifluous tones.
 Tark turned to face Ned once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Excellent.
 We'll be landing shortly, Mr.
 Larkin.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You made dinner reservations?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked him.
 Tark stared at him for a moment before sceding an answer with a slightly
 confused look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and his answer sounded a lot like a question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you reserved a table for five.
 Does that mean you're offering a night out? Like a welcoming gift?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said smiling a bit awkwardly, always a polite smile on his lips.
 He could see Parcifal fidgeting uncomfortably near the ship's prow, as
 if itching to get off the

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Good gracious, no!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark exclaimed with a polite little laugh.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would've been impertinent to say the least.
 Quite frankly, whatever gave you that idea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark was looking at Ned from head to toe; what Ned implied sounded almost
 absurd.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been in the field for months.
 I'm having a blast tonight.
 All sorts of debauchery in mind, if you must know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wasn't asking about details, but what about us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned demanded with a sharp frown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Judith will handle your lot.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What does that mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It means you need to co-operate and everything will be fine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squinted as he gazed towards the city, a hand over his eyes.
 From the right point of view, the setting sun did not blind but rather
 painted the round-topped towers with a rosy, pinkish sheen.
 Ned's answer came with a heavy, slow nod of his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll co-operate alright.
 Just as long as we're treated fair and proper,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and made sure to stress the last word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about her?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and pointed at Parcifal, looking at her sideways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Parcifal is strong-willed and proud.
 She's like a hurt, caged animal right now.
 You never know when she might lash out,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and shrugged.
 Tark took him by one shoulder and nearly whispered in his ear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As a word of advice, don't act the fool with Intelligence.
 You're not Human League citizens; you'll be granted a provisional status
 upon landing.
 And that halfuin friend of yours.
 He'll be in trouble.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How do you mean? What kind of trouble?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said sounding alarmed and rightly so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see he's humanoid, not human standard.
 He will be considered an illegal alien,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised an eyebrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Winceham? He might be old and smell bad because he never takes a bath, but
 he's not an alien!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not the official take on the matter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned slightly around to see Parcifal; it appeared as if
 he was checking up on her.
 He saw Judith was busy making last minute checks to her inventory, all
 neatly stacked and tied down to the deck.
 Ned's voice was filled with sudden angst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why didn't you say so before?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It would have been pointless, really.
 There was no place to drop him off,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied with a smug little grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And now there is? Treating halfuins like aliens.
 Aren't there any short people in the Human League?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's an entirely different subject.
 I don't make policy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and squatted, reaching for a metal box near the helm.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're on the clock.
 I'm doing you a great favor just by letting you know.
 It could get me into a lot of trouble.
 Lose my job, get shot.
 I'm talking that kind of trouble,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sounded positively serious even though the grin would not leave
 his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You won't buy us dinner, but you're willing to risk getting shot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's not get all chummy all of a sudden,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and raised one finger with one hand while he rummaged inside
 the metal box with the other.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dinner is one thing; getting shot is a professional perk anyway.
 I like to think of it as extending a little bit of professional courtesy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said looking up to Ned with a smile.
 In his hands he held what looked like a small backpack or rather a large
 bag with straps and whatnot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I'm a performer.
 You're a..
 Spy, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked with a good measure of uncertainty.
 To his knowledge, spies were vermin-like people, all cloak and dagger that
 you'd never guess in a million years what they did for a living.
 On the other hand, Tark was practically shouting it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Things seldom are the way they appear to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and perfunctorily gave the bag a look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not a spy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you seriously expecting me to answer that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said while wearing the bag on his back.
 It was black and somewhat rotund.
 A pair of red lines made of stitches ran its length; they were made to
 look like lightning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Tark said grinning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't look tailor-made,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and made a sour face of disbelief.
 Tark replied without hinting at any sort of being annoyed or indeed being
 called a retard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Tark paused for a moment and gave the question some thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I wouldn't know about that.
 I'm not the one making up the names.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, what does it do?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned asked, voicing some genuine interest in what appeared to be little
 more than a bag with a strange colour scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked conversationally.
 He shrugged vaguely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, there's no magic involved.
 It's a simple aetheric device.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

You mean like, involving aether science?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's what the big-heads in VV-section told me, yes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark replied, fastening a pair of straps around his waist.
 Ned's gaze seemed drawn to the retardation device.
 After a couple of moments of scrutiny, Ned asked poignantly with one hand
 resting under his chin, to add even more thoughtfulness into his words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What if that fails?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Tark blinked thoughtfully in silence before staring at Ned with a very particula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There's always religion, I'm told,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and walked past Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are you going?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned asked him with a tint of curiosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to jump,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and made a jumping gesture with both hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were coming along,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said and took a few steps closer to Tark, with his hands crossed over
 his chest.
 He was pouting slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, no.
 I'm not even supposed to be on this ship,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said grinning profusely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

So, you're hiding as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hiding is a harsh term.
 Obfuscating one's wherabouts is much more preferable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It still means you're hiding.
 Winceham will be forced to go into hiding as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Look, I really need to jump.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I need you to do me a favor,

 Ned said and touched Tark on the shoulder, smiling lightly.
 Tark noticed the gesture and sighed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is strictly business.
 Nothing personal to all of this, do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark said and turned his back on Ned.
 He grasped the railing and was preparing to really jump overboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't jump just yet if I were you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said, tapping Tark's shoulder profusely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Sweetness of a maiden's tit! What is it now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark yelled with aggravation.
\end_layout

Winceham jumped in that glorified parachute of yours a while ago.

He did?Then what am I wearing exactly?

His backpack,

 Ned said with a beaming smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Why didn't I notice?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark asked, looking at the backpack's straps mundanely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Misdirection, mostly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said as if it should have been obvious.
 Tark stepped away from the railing and took off the backpack.
 He opened it hastily and found nothing but a half-eaten mushroom salad
 sandwich along with a note that read:

Did you know about this?

 Tark said and his stared turned sour when he pointed a finger at Judith

It's not her fault, Tark.

I might be able to,

 Tark admitted, raising an eyebrow.

As an added incentive, Winceham's got your money pouch.

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark said and his lip stiffened.

No need to worry; he has enough sense to leave some of that money for dinner.

I'm not sure if you're in the right line of business,

The ship was the Mary Drunkard; a twelve-gun fast runner, light and deadly
 as a hawk when it first was put to sea.
 Three hundred and twenty three years later though, it was a small miracle
 or perhaps even a feat of magic that vessel still remained afloat.
 Anyone who could afford a bit of common sense would have bet an arm and
 a leg that a ship filled with gaping holes and made out of maggot-infested,
 rotten wood would happily sink away like a rock.
 The few unlucky souls who made those kinds of bets gave a small bump in
 the always-in-demand, but never-really-breaking-it-big, prosthetics industry.

The original owner, a rich eccentric drunkard that liked to spend his vast

Lernea looked skeptical, while Theo sported a withdrawn expression, thoughtful
 to the point of weariness.
 It had everything to do with the gameboard he was glued to, its multi-coloured
 tiles and many pieces too much for the untrained eye.

 Lernea suggested at one point and inched a finger closer to one piece.
 Theo stopped her in her tracks with a single, wild-eyed glance.
 She drew her hand back onto her lap, where Bo sat, her bunny eyes going
 back and forth between Theo and the captain, as if a tiny spark was all
 that was needed to ignite a deadly silence into a veritable mayhem.
 But all they were doing was sitting comfortably around a table, sipping
 some tea and playing Po.

 Captain Van der Breckenrod asked with an abruptly aroused suspicion, holding
 his chin up; the pipe in his mouth followed suit and remained stuck upwards
 as it glowed, ember-red after he drew heavily on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Po,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Theo without skipping a beat or breaking his concentration.
 The Captain looked around him for a moment, looked at the table and let
 the smoke out of his nostrils.
 A small cloud hovered between him and Theo before he finally rolled his
 eyes and as if waking from a dream, fluttered his eyelids and said,

Of course, Po!

Bo fidgeted and couldn't sit still.
 She had been growing more and more nervous by the minute.
 She voiced to Lernea and Theo, for their minds alone:

Lernea tried to control her breathing; her face jerked slightly, involuntarily,
 as if something had bitten her.
 She picked up Bo and looked her in the eyes, those wonderfully red-hued
 bunny eyes with the propensity to spout fiery wrath when she was provoked.
 Bo looked rather adorable in her fluffy white bunny form, and Lernea was
 a young woman of noble heart, scion to a kingdom and very lady-like, good
 and proper in her manners, just and swift with her bow.
 But she was an inch closer to actually breaking the bunny's neck, and Bo
 could feel she was at the edge of a chasm.

Let's just say, for the sake of argument, you were afraid, for some reason
 - well-founded or not - afraid a particular set of events might occur in
 the future.
 Like taking an arrow to your knee that prevented you from living the life
 of an adventurer.
 Or some stranger you just met was awfully weird and had really bad bladder
 control on top of a drinking problem that made you suspicious of him.
 That man would not constitute a let's say, clear and present danger against
 your person, without showing overt aggresiveness in the form of killing
 you outright, in your sleep, or at least trying to throw you overboard
 to the killer whales now.
 In which I would be more than happy to do something about it to the best
 of my ability.
 Seeing though, as there isn't any evidence to support such a claim, I would
 be remiss to not point out that going on and on about a hypothetical situation
 without any basis on reality \SpecialChar \-
 bent as it may be under certain circumstances
 \SpecialChar \-
 can drive a person mad.
 It would thus be, by any account, not unlikely for a person under duress
 to be driven into acts of temporary insanity as can be proven under law,
 to which extent said person might not be held liable for his actions and
 be set free.
 Wouldn't you agree, overall, gentlemen?

 Lernea said without tearing her eyes away from Bo who sat perfectly still,
 soaking in what was mostlty intended for her ears.

Captain Van der Breckenrod looked at Lernea sideways for a moment and then
 looked at the glass in his hand.
 There was a little tiny piece of handicraft floating in it, an umbrella
 \SpecialChar \-
 or some would argue, a parasol \SpecialChar \-
 and it was slowly sinking in the dark,
 cherry red mixture of unidentifiable alcohol and rum.
 He downed the glass in one go, frowned heavily for a while, checked the
 bottom of the glass for signs of more liquor and then turned and told Lernea,
 the tiny umbrella still stuck on his beard:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I, for one, Miss Testarossa, am agreed.
 I am quite agreeable a person, after all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and threw away the tiny umbrella with the intention of sending
 it overboard.
 Instead, it somehow flew around in circles and settled on Theo's hair,
 who was too pre-occupied with planning his next move to afford the most
 perfunctory of looks.
 He did nod though, but only to himself in relation to a possible move he
 was contemplating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That's quite alright, Mr.

 Silence is after all, a common indicator of approval.

 Lernea said and Bo seemed to nod imperceptibly.
 She remained silent indeed, and almost looked prudish somehow.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, if my crew is any indication, you are spot on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the old pirate said and raised his glass.
 It was pretty soon floating mid-air in the direction of the ramshackle
 captain's cabin.
 Lernea had noticed a lot of that was going on around the ship; sails hoisting
 themselves, ropes being tied up as if by way of magic, giant waterproof
 holes in the hull.
 Yet it had nothing to do with magic, or else Bo would have at least a real
 possible threat to take into account.
 It had to do with ghosts and Theo was the only who could not just see them
 but talk to them as well.
 It had something to do with Rho, the ever-present life force of sorts that
 existed in everything living.
 Somehow, that even involved the undead.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Still, a skeleton crew, no pun intended.

I mean, it's just you and what was it, three ghosts?

 she said and Theo nodded reassuringly to her.
 He had made his move and thus was now aware of what was Lernea was saying.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You've been lost at sea for fifteen years.

 the captain said nodding.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Sometimes though, I do wake up and see what's for breakfast and I wish I
 were dead, yes.
 But then I'm reminded I might end up as ghost crew in a ghost ship and
 I just know the kind of heartless bastards that run those ships,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and gave the main mast an angry, crazed stare.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That brings me back to my senses,

 he said and took a swig from his pipe before moving a pawn shaped like
 an extravagantly built windmill to a blue tile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Interesting,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and reshuffled himself in his seat.
 He was rather more quiet than his usual self.
 He hadn't raised many questions since he had woken up, and he had made
 no mention of Tejwel, the bear involved in whatever that thing they blew
 up in Tallyflop was.
 Theo must've thought him a real friend indeed, judging by the way he so
 easily and quite impressively killed the Ygg as if they were nothing more
 than monsters.
 It had certainly had some effect on him; he suddenly appeared grim and
 boring, all grown-up.
 Even the game they had been playing seemed utterly drab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is interesting exactly? I haven't heard of this game before.
 All I see is a mosaic of tiles on an irregularly shaped board, and lots
 of different pieces made out of practically anything solid.
 Not to mention you've been playing for four hours straight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said and sat up straight in the utilitarian stool.
 She produced a comb out of a small vest pocket, and began combing her hair.
 Apart from not doing much to rectify the sad affair that her hair had been
 reduced to, the combing had the deleterious effect of grains of sand falling
 onto the gameboard with a rasping, cluttering sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could you do that someplace else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Theo said while the captain extended a hand blindly to receive his flying,
 refilled glass of the cocktail he was drinking, complete with a tiny umbrella
 and everything, up to and including a slice of pineapple.
 Lernea looked at Theo and noticed his stare wasn't the usual bland-eyed
 stare he seemed to confront the world at large with; it had a purpose and
 a hint of ire this time.
 She stopped combing her hair and apologised, though she hadn't expected
 anyone to notice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 roughly shaping up a sphere in the air.

I thought games were supposed to be fun,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was looking at the pirate intently, ears standing
 tall and upright like antennae.
 Though she remained silent, Lernea felt she was ready to absorb everything
 the captain was saying.
 Theo, on the other hand, was looking at the gameboard with a heavy frown,
 too absorbed in planning his strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They have to be fun, so people will want to play them.
 Do keep in mind, people's idea of fun differs greatly.
 For instance, Mr.

 throw away all the navigating equipment.

Lernea nodded with a frown, while the captain let the barbed comment sink
 in.
 After seemingly observing a moment of silence, the captain spoke again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're not having that discussion, again, Mr.
 Gunadeer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said flatly and drew on the pipe.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You see, Ms.
 Testarossa, fun and games can be quite productive past-times.
 The risk-taking, the strategy involved, the planning, the logistics of
 the thing, your opponent and his idea of you, your idea of him..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and straightened the dead parrot on his shoulder.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that's detailed enough, it's like war and all that fighting that goes
 on and on everywhere.
 But if you play it out first, in something as innocuous looking as this
 little board of Po, it might show you an advantageous situation, a way
 out of trouble or a way in.
 A winning strategy, or the cost of defeat.
 It's more of a tool, Po.
 It has the added benefit it's pretty hard to injure yourself.
 Unlike swordfighting.

\begin_layout Standard

So in essence, it's like Zatrik,

 Both the captain and Theo were instantly adamant in their rebuttal.

\begin_layout Standard

No need to get excited.

 Lernea said and noticed Bo was nowhere to be seen.
 Which was quite unsettling knowing she could flame her eyes up in a split
 second and start fireballing everything for no apparent reason.
 Adding her latest streak of paranoia did not help either.

 Theo said and looked around him, the tiny umbrella still stuck in his dreadlock
s.
 The fog was clearing up; the first purely golden rays of sun shafted through
 from above.
 It was as if someone had delineated an invisible line on some grandiose
 map, where one side was all grey and bland and the other side was shiny,
 green and sported cute depictions of butterflies and cupids.
 It looked like the ship had just passed it and emerged on the fancy, nice

 eyes slightly glowing orange, not unlike tiny beacons.

 Bo sent to Lernea's mind with a sigh.
 It seemed like the perfect answer to Lernea for a moment; her mind was
 indeed elsewhere.

Her gaze wandered up and down the coastline that unfurled itself graciously.
 The sun was almost noon-high, shining with all its might.
 Its warmth was a pleasant contrast to the icy fresh breeze; they were still
 somewhere cold but at least there was warmth to be found in the daylight.
 At the farthest reaches, Lernea could still make out large rocky cliffs
 and islets.
 A spatter of snow and ice hugged their tops.
 But the way the ship was pointed, they were sailing straight for a small
 bay, surround by golden and brown thickets.
 In the distance beyond, a hilly terrain formed, slightly sloping into the
 grey phantom vision of a mountain ridge.
 What was more telling, she could see thin columns of smoke rising up from
 the bay.

The walls of the Marvellously Rotund and Equivocally Reassuring Grandiose
 Officious Hall of Endearment were basically rotund and ostensible too large
 for the common eye to perceive.
 Yet it was simply one of many similar halls \SpecialChar \-
 if not in name certainly in
 capacity \SpecialChar \-
 dotted around the Naval Intelligence Bureau building in Rampatur
 City, itself one of many government buildings of varied shape and uniformly
 huge size to be found in the very center of the city.
 From the outside, the Naval Intelligence building looked like an even,
 totally opaque block from which a huge flag of the Human League was unfurled,
 drooping over the north face, above the diminutive revolving door entrance.
 It was identical to any other government building and noone in Rampatur
 seemed to pay it the least amount of notice, even if everything it shadowed
 was made cooler.
 As in, the temperature dropped because of the huge shadow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hall boasted some soft lighting in the form of a couple of unseen spotlights
; Ned, Tark, Judith and Parcifal were standing under guard.
 Four men in full body armor, boasting elaborately ornate halberds that
 sported some sort of exotic machinery on them were keeping an eye on all
 of them.
 The ridiculously coloured suit came with a number of silly-looking hats
 being worn one on top of another, as well as any number of a variety of
 feathers adorning them.
 There were also a number of medals and bones hanging from the guards' breastpla
te armor.
 If anything at all, they looked like some sort of very state-of-the-art
 laughable jokers armed with nonetheless sharp instruments of bleeding death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood emotionless, with a cold, calculating gaze.
 Ned was wary; he felt the whole situation was akin to a very tight balancing
 rope act, without a safety net, and razor sharp spikes on either side of
 the terminal drop.
 Tark was looking smug and confident in a very stylish, simple yet exotic
 suit of black cloth with matching smart pants and soft, spongy shoulder
 pads that made him look pretty suave.
 Judith was weary, fidgeting in her tight leather suit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In front of them, at what was probably judged to be a safe but not too impractic
al distance sat the Impromptu Intelligent Committee on Matters of Intelligence
 Missions Gathering Intelligence and Whatnot.
 There was even a wooden sign carved with those exact words sitting on a
 bleak, wooden desk where the members of the Committee rested their crossed
 hands.
 They were all dressed in non-descript white robes.
 Only the older man among them wore a fine-wrought silver chain around his
 neck from where a small curio hang.
 Their desk was filled with all manner of scrolls, maps, and papers which
 were being scrutinised.
 The sound of shuffling papers reverberated accross the gigantic empty space
 of the hall which appeared to have, oddly enough, excellent acoustics.

 You've wasted hundreds of thousands of Bureau timeshares, gallivanting

They left the ghost ship with its skeleton crew in a nearby alcove, protected
 from view by the steep, sharp mossy cliffs.
 From then on the walk to the village was an easy, refreshing trip which
 they began as soon as they set foot on land.
 Lernea offered thanks and praise to Svarna for guiding her home, and kissed
 the ground, quickly realising the picture in her mind did not match the
 taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The salty breeze mingled with the smells of green grass and mush, wet ground.
 It brought a heartfelt smile to Lernea to be back home, even under the

 the man who had been to her more than the grandfather she had never met,
 was alive and well, despite what she had seen with her eyes.

Theo felt the cold climate bite at his linen robes.
 The southern seas were warm, and space had been generously temperate and
 comfortable.
 But the northern reaches of Nomos offered a cold, harsh climate, suitable
 for the hardy locals, but not so friendly to anyone else.
 Except Bo who was covered in fur and was quite excited at the prospect
 of munching on northern, exotic grass; brushes were rare and flowers even
 rarer, but they provided a challenge with interesting, mouth-filling rewards.
 She delightfully hopped along, sampling what freshness the outdoors of
 Nomos had to offer.

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea was decidedly not asking Sisyphus a lot of questions; she was content
 knowing that there was time enough to get up to date on matters of importance.
 And there were quite a lot of those, Master Sisyphus had told her, but
 his philosophy was that the slow, careful approach, always offered more
 time to think and analyse.
 Those in turn, offered more choices of action, and considerably more ways
 of egress out of nasty situations.
 Which was, how he had by a combination of good fortune and clever planning,
 avoided turning into a crisp.

Parcifal is with them.

The moment she stepped into the house, the smell of roast fish assaulted
 her nostrils, and she felt a pinching on her neck.
 Then another one, and another one in quick succession.
 Her head started spinning and she became oddly aware that the house was
 being lifted into the sky, as if it was made out of gum.
 In fact, she slumped onto the floor with a strange smile on her face and
 lay there, peacefully unconscious.

Sisyphus calmly appeared through the door, stepping over Lernea casually.

 he inquired, and a double-shot of tiny globes of fire flew right past his
 hair, singing it slightly, to strike at patches of darkness at the roof.
 Cries of agony were heard before the reassuring thudding of bodies hitting
 the floor.
 Bo appeared throught the door, eyes flaring, ears pointing straight up,
 ready for a second burst of flames.
 Sisyphus made a hand gesture to the bunny.
 Bo raised her head and looked at him in an uncannily human fashion.

 The smell of burnt cloth filled the room.

The large auditorium was filled with all kinds of people, dressed in all
 sorts of garments ranging from the skimpy, adventurously revealing outfits

 and stylish attire of the Ritz, the metropolitan heartland of the Human

 For what it was worth, the Extemporal Local Authority Council Issue Docket

\begin_layout Standard
As the sizzling crowd hummed a collective tune of uneasy expectancy in the
 air, the same raw feeling of being slightly nervous had Ned almost sweating.
 Winceham was sitting to his left; his jump from the Mary Righteous had
 been a resounding success.
 After they'd met for dinner, he was loathe to disclose details of his exact
 whereabouts, but he very eagerly went on to consume copious amounts of
 everything consumable, including beer, alchohol and spirits.
 As such, it was no wonder he was grumpy, feeling sick with a splitting
 headache and itching for a smoke, a small luxury that was denied to him
 while the vote was cast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham toyed with his empty pipe wearing a sour expression on his face.
 Next to him sat Parcifal; her silent manner and grim face afforded her
 an awesome, deadly-looking gaze.
 Her eyes scanned the auditorium piecemeal, looking for danger without success.
 Her gaze though did lock on to the form of the Council members, once they
 entered the auditorium's stage, dressed in elaborate, ornate, red and black
 robes, wearing plush velvet hats that looked like furry bloated versions
 of dead skunk-like creatures, strangely coloured but thankfully odourless.
 They looked rather silly to everyone except for the crowd in the auditorium;
 the noise died down to the a few careless whispers too suddenly.
 Ned turned his head and asked Judith in a whisper:

 Parcifal hissed suddenly and her eyes met with Ned's in a strange, awkwardly
 cold fashion.
 She was evidently upset; she hadn't been herself ever since Lernea was
 drawn in that cataclysmic hole, possibly lost forever.
 They knew Lernea, Theo and Bo were alive, but where they had ended up was
 beyond them.
 There was little they could do, and there were more pressing issues at
 hand; their home planet was in danger and this was their chance to make
 a whole lot of difference.
 It was disconcerting for Ned though not to be able to read through Parcifal's
 opaqueness; he didn't know whether she was so tightened up because she
 might never see her sister again or because of a whole world being at stake.
 Still, he was worried about her, and especially that temper of hers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned felt surprisingly calm and reassured.
 It was as if he knew that everything was somehow going to work out itself.
 He felt that his new friends were able to hold on their own.
 And even if they never met again, just knowing they were alive somewhere
 made him breath more easily.
 His mind went to Judith suddenly; there too, was a newly found friend.
 He smiled thinly as he ventured a sideways look to the young woman who
 had saved his life back on Tallyflop; he was about to say something to
 her when he felt Winceham's elbow poking him through his ribs:

 Before Ned had time to do anything about it, Parcifal picked him up from
 his jacket and propped him straight up forcefully without a moment's hesitation.

 Parcifal hissed the next moment, in line with what everyone else was doing

 He wore short, white, thinning hair and a bright set of blue eyes that

 His only mark of office was a silver pin against his chest; it was the

Trust! Trust, fellow council members and citizens, is the real issue.
 Lady Godiva cannot be entrusted with those responsibilities she so vividly
 claims to be her top priority.
 How can we trust someone so frivolous with her public image, a person of
 wild and unseemly behavior, who struts around the City of Rampatur like
 an infatuated child, all glitter and smiles, spending her time in the arms
 of an agent of the Bureau, for everyone to see.

The good Lord Kennelsey obviously has no real facts to present to this assembly,

 invaluable insight into this new-fangled threat.
 I will not go into the depth and breadth of the threat that Lord Kennelsey's
 fixation with what happens in people's bedrooms might entail for the safety
 of the Human League at large.
 It is perhaps of paramount importance in his own mind, but I have yet to

It is no wonder Lady Govida so shamelessly admits her malfeasance to appear

 She keeps on purveying all about this Ygg threat without one solid piece

 What we do have to go on is hearsay and imaginary reports from the man

Seriously, this attack on my credibility is Lord Kennelsey's futile and

 If there is one thing Lord Kennelsey is known for, is his long-standing
 service to the Human League as chanchellor and treasurer, secretary to

 time and again proved vicariously indispensable to emptying our coffers

 My service to the Human League is a matter of public record; and if I were
 as arrogant and self-aggrandising as Lady Govida, I would consider myself
 proud to have served fully and to the best of my ability the Human League

 Sisyphus said and produced Theo's crystal from a pocket in his robes.
 It looked every bit as perfect as the last time Lernea had laid eyes upon
 it; there was a faint cloud of lights dancing in its very heart, casting
 rays filled with an arcane glow, forming intricate geometrical patterns.
 Lernea was instantly awestruck and nearly drowned as her mouthful of mead

 Sisyphus said shaking his head slightly, a meditating look on his age-worn

 Lernea said with an involuntary smirk.
 Sisyphus put the crystal on the table and laid his hands on his knees,
 his gaze wandering at the door of his study, as if peering through it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few moments of silence ensued; nothing but the sounds of birds chirping

 Then the door to Sisyphus study swung open wildly, the two boys breaking
 a sweat and panting, very nearly standing on top of one another.

\begin_layout Standard

One stupid question, then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fintias said as if to correct his master, his eyes searching for a place
 to hide, awaiting the impending scolding.
 Sisyphus said nothing for an awkward moment and then flung his cup against
 Fintias with a flick of his wrist.
 Fintias dodged the cup expertly and remarked in quizical, rather than impertine
nt manner:
\end_layout

What was that for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That was for testing your reflexes, as well as creating another stupid question,

 Again.
 You have to think smart, not just sound like it.
 Now, start up the Tellerator machine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said with a sigh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Tellerator?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon asked hesitantly, looking exactly like someone who wished he had
 misheard.
 Much to the boys disappointment, evident in their miserable faces, Sisyphus
 remained adamant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Tellerator machine.
 And hop to it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he insisted while the boys sprang into action, raising the lid of a hatch
 on the wooden floor and lowering a small ladder.
 Soon, they disappeared in the basement busily.
 Lernea offered quietly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't you think you're running the boys a bit too harshly, master? They're

 Young,

 she said finally after searching for the word and it sounded a bit peculiar

 It felt so long ago that she and Parcifal were in their place, yet it now
 seemed like another life entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They're brimming with life and energy, their minds are like a sponge - somewhat

 It's the best time to run them hard and harsh.
 From then on, living through life will seem to them like riding a horse

 Hasn't it been that way with you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea considered that for a bit.
 She raised a brow and replied earnestly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't really tell.
 I mean, I'm still learning and I've seen thing I can't even recall I had

 I sometimes shudder to think that I was the Queen of Nomos, even for just

 It makes me doubtful, uneasy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said looking troubled.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But I plow on, nonetheless.
 With a little help from Parcifal, and my friends,

 she said and shrugged, suddenly aware that she hadn't heard or seen Theo

 Sisyphus said enthusiastically.

I've done a great job, don't mind me saying,

And who can argue with a blade of steel such as Enceledos, eh?

 Sisyphus said laughing, only to be interrupted by the voices Damon, his
 head barely popping out of the hatch:

Master, the Tellerator machine is working,

 The disgruntled voice of Fintias was heard as well, muffled as it came
 from further inside the basement:

 up and made to walk to the hatch.

Oh, you'll wish you hadn't.

 where a cold, sunny afternoon so much like the ones from her childhood
 seemed to beckon.

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham was craning his neck upwards, trying to fit the whole length of
 the ship in his field of vision, but that wasn't possible.
 It wasn't possible for any of them from that up close to see the HLS Magnometri
ton in its full glory.
 Judith had been assigned to be their liaison with the ship's commander
 but so far, they'd seen noone to liaise with and they were simply waiting,
 sitting down at the docks of Navy Spire Thirty-Seven where the fleet had
 mostly assembled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned seemed to be in high spirits, and Parcifal was absorbed in watching
 over the lively preparations.
 Winceham was idly getting ready for a smoke, and Judith looked weary, even
 glum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below them lay more than a thousand feet of drop to the streets and shops
 of Rampatur City, while all around the horizon the peaceful countryside
 with its low-rolling hills and golden brown farmlands lay inviting, yet
 so unbearably in stark contrast to all the activity around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were hundreds of men and women loading up the ships with provisions
 of many kinds, some of which were fairly basic like dried food; for the
 larger part though, it was the cannonshot and all sorts of strange colourful
 pellets of some sort that seemed to demand the utmost care.
 There was quite quite some noise from all the activity, but not it wasn't
 overbearing.
 The sound of buffeting winds rushed by them from time to time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Ned asked Judith pointing a finger at the pellets.
 Judith breathed deeply before answering with a slight feeling of guilt:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Come on lass, it's not like you'd have to kill us if you told us lass,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said in an off-beat way, getting ready to light up his pipe with
 a local variety he was eager to taste, more doubly so since he had acquired
 the particular pouch of tobacco by virtue of his trade skills, namely,
 he'd stolen it from an unsuspecting, though evidently quite well-off man
 in the streets of Rampatur City.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judith turned her head and looked at the halfuin with a seriously bland
 expression; a slight shake of her head and a miniscule shrug of her shoulders
 only meant that she had no comment on that; which only meant it was true
 and she would have to kill them if she told them.
 Ned appeared rather hurt than shocked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 she said with a frown.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I can only hope you realise what's at stake here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Parcifal told Judith, in an almost scolding tone.
 Judith's eyes flashed not with anger, but with the glimmer of an innocent,
 hurt pride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I realise much more than you think you do, lady Teletha.
 Bear in mind I'm still an agent of the Human League, sworn and dedicated

 And although I can sympathie with you and your cause, I have to maintain
 a level-headed attitude.
 I cannot be anythin gother than dutiful and impartial; otherwise I might

 Judith replied, turning her stare at Ned and seeking his eyes which were
 locked on dead ahead at the Magnometriton's hull.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're saying you helping us might cause us trouble?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's right.
 I wish I could answer all your questions, and I wish I could help you more.
 I sometimes wish I had nothing to do with any of this but for me now, there

 We will be going into battle soon, and that is no time to question and

 Judith said, mostly for Ned to hear.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I will protect you to the best of my ability, but I have orders I need to
 follow.
 Don't make me choose, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and looked at the others with a truly sad pair of eyes.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Or any of you.
 My loyalty defines me, it's what makes me useful.

 she added, trying to sound apologetic, in a sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What if you need our protection?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned told her rather coldly.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then I wish you'd lend it heartily,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and shot Ned an honest, proud look.
 It was Parcifal who stood before Judith, the wind ruffling her short hair,
 her face unperturbed in any way, and told her:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't speak for the others, but I understand a soldier's loyalties cannot
 be divided.
 It would mean her ruin one way or the other.
 I appreciate your candid manner; it is more than most would offer though
 less than I would wish.
 Be it so, I shall stand my ground next to you, sword in hand, to face the
 common enemy as long as it is your wish as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judith nodded solemnly to Parcifal, while Ned shook his head slightly.
 Winceham shrugged before coughing wildly, his body shaking; he roared and
 grumbled for a few moments, before clearing up his lungs and throat.
 A hearty glob of mucus and spit left his lips and landed a couple of feet
 away, and onto a pair of nice, shiny boots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boots belonged to a tall, almost gaunt man with a smart beard and moustache,
 who looked rather prim and elegant in his suit, full of decorations and
 shiny bars and medals, without being chest-heavy because of them.
 He was wearing a captain's cap and owned a set of piercing black eyes;
 by his side stood an attache, a rather short fellow with a face seemingly
 built for smiling, which was what he was doing even as he reached for the
 captain's boots with a piece of cloth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Captain Elsenior Jones?

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why, yes.
 I presume you are agent Judith of Naval Intelligence.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I speak for all when I say that calling us aliens is an insult, captain,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned said out of turn, looking stern but not angry.
 The captain replied in kind, even as his attache had cleaned up the glob
 of spit; realising the piece of cloth had been rendered useless, he tossed
 it expertly without the captain noticing.
 Winceham offered a slight bow of apology and the attache just shrugged
 it off with a grin and a thumbs-up, which only served to confuse the halfuin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I wouldn't know, sir; it's in the Navy's line of business to insult each

Of course, rank has its privileges.
 Sailors and officer's alike face corporal punishment if they trashtalk

 Ned said and Judith simply shot him a wild-eyed look and went up the stairs

\begin_layout Standard
Master Sisyphus was juggling a number of dials and levers of an arcane design
 in an expert, controlled fashion.
 Whirring sounds and the occasional clanging noise reverberated throughout
 the intricate machine as he handled it with attention to every detail,
 feeling his way to the mysteries of the crystal under scrutiny as it revolved
 slowly in a receptacle which glowed with a multitude of lights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two boys, Damon and Fintias were both pedalling hard on a doohickey
 made of leather belts and iron cast wheels connected in a complex way to
 the tatar device.
 Sweat ran down their foreheads freely, their faces flush red.

\begin_layout Standard

 Damon ventured, panting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Be silent.
 This is delicate work! Keep pedalling!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus replied hastily without turning his focus away from the machine.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This is fantastic.
 The thaumaturgic levels are nothing like I have ever seen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he murmured audibly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So much for being an expert,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Fintias said under his breath.
 To his dismay, Sisyphus overheard the comment, even though he was evidently
 enthralled by the study of the crystal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Haven't I been definitive about being a smart ass, Fintias? Triple chores

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the boy complained painfully and slowed down the pedalling.
 The tatar device began flickering, becoming unstable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

More pedal! Don't slow down, not now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus urged the two boys and Fintias groaned, pedalling back up to speed.
 The flickering stopped and the machine resumed its normal, still unsettling
 noises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If that seems to be the case, then...
 By the Gods, I need to write this down.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We know!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fintias groaned again, his voice brooding from the physical effort, only
 to elicit Damon's weary eye and a thorough, disapproving shake of the other
 boy's head.
 Master Sisyphus was engrossed in finding a clean piece of scroll and a
 pen in what undoubtedly was a mess of a laboratory, pieces of equipment
 lying about in various states of working order, ranging from nuts and bolts
 to full-blown monstrosities ready to go if one dared to use them.
 Still though, a simple writing apparatus complete with paper and ink wasn't
 easy to find under a heap of books, plans, designs and thingamajigs.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bah! What good are you two when you're most needed?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus wondered and shuffled at various desks and shelves at random.
 Before long, he found a suitable piece of scroll, that had only been used
 in the most rudimentary way; an old shopping list with enough room in the
 back.
 He picked up a jarred piece of a broken glass tube, very much like a sharp-tipp
ed pen and dipped it in a nearby pool of dropped, always-wet ink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Damon asked petulantly.

 Fintias added morosely.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would you have it on your heads if the world crumbles away and the universe
 is engulfed in the eternal flames of destruction?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus asked the boys in all seriousness even as his hand scribbled down
 in a muddied, dense script, notes, numbers and designs that seemed to make
 no sense.
 The two boys barely had the energy to venture a miserable look at each
 other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This will change everything.
 At least, everything that matters,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said staring at the piece of scroll he had just finished writing
 down.
 He put the piece of glass dripping with ink down on the machine, and simply
 stared at the crystal in awe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Can we stop now? Please, master,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon said even as the lights on the machine began flickering on and off
 alarmingly once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Haven't we discussed the merits of pereseverence, Damon?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Master Sisyphus said even as a terrible cracking noise thundered above
 them, followed by a series of thuds and howls.
 It sounded like a whirlwind had ripped the roof of the house.
 Sisyphus looked up, as if the noise was unsettling only in the way a pesky
 rat might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We're kind of beat, to be perfectly honest, master,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon said as his pedalling slowed to less than a walking pace, while Fintias
 had given up entirely and was resting his chin on a handle of the pedalling
 apparatus.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I want to go to sleep,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fintias murmured drowsily, right before the wooden planks above their heads
 was ripped apart by half a dozen blue and black claws.
 Through the gaping chasm, tendrils writhed and squirmed like living things
 with a mind of their own, reaching for the two boys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm afraid that'll have to wait.
 Polearms! On the double, boys! Cover!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said and reached under his robes, uncovering a miniscule repeating
 crossbow with unusually sharp cone-shaped bolts.
 The boys fell on the ground instinctively, the clawed hands and tendrils
 hitting nothing but air.
 Sisyphus had an easy enough target, a blue-black mass of flesh that was
 stuck half-way into the basement.
 He let fly his shots wildly, turning a crank that reloaded the crossbow
 in less than a second.
 All the bolts found their target; the monsters seemed to feel and acknowledge
 that they'd been hit, but it didn't seem to slow them down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They ripped another whole section of flooring and just when they were about
 to jump down, they began trembling uncontrollably, faint rivulets of milky
 fluid oozing from where they'd been stung.
 The next moment, they exploded like a toad on a hot summer's day, without
 warning, in a messy, gory fashion, milky blood and pieces of tendrils and
 arms flying in all directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That wasn't supposed to happen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus said puzzled, while the boys reappeared, each armed with a wooden
 training polearm easily three times as tall as them.
 Lernea popped her head through the flooring, milky stuff dripping from
 her dangling hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Master, we need to move.
 Right now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said urgently while behind her Bo shot past in an amazing flying leap,
 shooting fireballs that left a sizzling sound long after they'd flown into
 a couple of directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not the training polearms! The real ones!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus exploded in anger, while tucking the crystal and the piece of
 scroll safely under his robes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Ready or not, you'll have to do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and reached for an arrow in her quiver before standing up and
 away from the hole in the floor.
 The sounds of battle echoed down below, as otherworldly cries rose up from
 numerous directions.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You heard the queen, boys.
 Consider this a pass if you live,

 Fintias wondered and Damon shrugged.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You don't suppose this is just another elaborate test?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fintias said, as they too climbed the creaky staircase, wielding the polearms
 in a cumbersome manner, very much like fishing poles.
 What they saw at ground floor, left them speechless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The roof of the house had been ripped apart, as if shaved off.
 The walls had mostly turned into rough patches of still standing wood and
 bodies of the same hideous black-and-blue monsters that had attacked them
 lay everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bunny that had only barely singed a couple of locks off their hair,
 was hopping about, letting go firebolts with dead-eye accuracy at the ranks
 of the approaching, abyssal foe that the boys had only believed existed
 in nightmares, of the worst sort.
 Lernea was picking her targets wisely, covering for Bo, and Theo was levitating
 a foot or so above ground, holding his hands against his ears, as if trying
 to block out everything from his mind.

 Lernea answered flatly.

 head of a flying Ygg who had bad ideas about her welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Excellent tactical analysis, my queen.
 But on the strategic side, if those Ygg were already here, lying in wait...
 That only meant they were waiting for you, and that crystal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Sisyphus told her as he stood by her side, reloading his crossbow with
 spare bolts from a cupboard-turned-armory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What did you find out?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea replied as she nocked another arrow in her bow, waiting for a good

 Bo was having a blast, literally but was too busy turning Ygg into crispy
 stumps to even send a thought on the matter.
\end_layout

 Master Sisyphus said and Lernea replied with a shake of her head and said
 `Rho' once more.
 Only, no matter how loud her shout, her mouth seemed to simply open and
 close, in a slow, languid fashion, the sound of the compression shock that
 expanded from Theo visible in the air, blanketing everything in all directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And indeed, just like a stone makes waves when it lands on water, so did
 the power of Rho reverberate in a radius all around them, the Ygg writhing
 in sudden, terrible agony before their heads exploded in a gory mess of
 milky blood, pieces of tendrils and cerebral matter flying about, leaving
 their bodies to slump hard against the ground, exactly like a puppet whose
 strings were torn away.

 I don't see anything strange.
 It's just that I'd never fully realised how beautiful home was,

 Ned said thoughtfully and turned to look at the captain with a furrowed
 brow.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have you noticed anything strange, Mr.
 Peelpot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he then asked the plump little man whose uniform looked about ready to
 burst.
 The captain of the HLS Maryland gave the matter the short time of attention
 it required and formulated an easy enough answer: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're running low on beer, sir, and as any half-competent sailor will tell
 you, that could prove to be troublesome.
 A beer-disgruntled crew is no laughing matter; I'll check the stores personally.

I was under the impression that, with the ship being so small and all, there's
 very little crew involved.
 In fact,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned nodded at Winceham who was shooting craps with a small gang of sailors
 under the main mast of the Maryland, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there's the whole lot of the crew right there.
 They look disgruntled all right, but I wouldn't suppose it's because of
 the beer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he pointed out as another wave of boos and awfully uncharming swearing
 rose out from a half-dozen men who seemed to be having a suspiciously long-wind
ed streak of bad luck, while the captain disappeared below deck in a show
 of swiftness that his plump body belied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Seven times in a row? Again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried one of the crew.
 Judging from the look on his face, even if he was probably not very well
 versed in statistics, he knew there was something terribly lucky about
 winning seven times in a row, again.
 And everyone knew, luck always runs out in the end, not the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is seven a bad number for you? How about eight?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said with a provocatively smug grin, just about ready to throw
 another round of the dice.
 Another one of the crew rose up to his full height, which was a little
 more than twice Winceham's diminutive, halfuin-standard size.
 He placed a very haunting look of bad things waiting to happen on him,
 but Winceham continued unfazed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bets? Anyone? No?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he asked around, more comfortable-looking than a pig rolling in mud.
 He received no reply and just as he was ready to pick up the small pile
 of coins resting on the ship's floor, the tall, heavy-set sailor who otherwise
 looked like a nice fellow, withholding the fact he could crush a man larynx
 single-handedly, told him in a rather calm yet threatening way.

Winceham cocked his head sideways and looked at him the way kids look at

\begin_inset Quotes eld

These are my winnings.

 Winceham said as he made to gather the small shiny golden pile in his cupped
 hands.

 another sailor added with some more bravado.

Now I won't have any of that namecalling.
 First and foremost, I'm a gentleman and I demand some satisfaction to my

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham said in a passionate voice even as he began sweeping the coins
 with the cup of his hand off the ship's deck and into his money pouch.
 Everyone of the sailors had lost money.
 A lot of money that perhaps equalled half of a month's pay.
 Which was a quarter of their drinking money.
 Which was a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them took the dice into his hand for the first time since Winceham
 started shooting, and felt them in his hands.
 Then he held one up and turned it round and round; they looked like perfectly
 ordinary dice.
 He shot one down on the deck; the dice hopped and spun, and fumbled and
 sat in one of its faces with a seriously ponderous wobble.
 The face had the crude drawing of an anchor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Anchor.

The group got up on their feet and huddled around Winceham, just about ready
 to unanimously vote on giving him a silent treatment of the old soap in
 a sock.
 Ned demanded their attention, in his most conversational tone of voice:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Now, gentlemen, I'm sure we're all a little uptight about the mission and

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The men slowly looked at Ned with a curious kind of gaze, the kind people
 might think lizards look like when copulating.
 It was eerie and uncomfortable, but it somehow got their attention for
 a moment, only to have Winceham pull them back in:

 another sailor asked mildly confused.

No, no, you see this genie, you make a wish, and the captain wished for

Oh.

 Ned said to himself mostly and another sailor, the eldest of the crew,
 the one who had misheard earlier, did so again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 the tall sailor said grinning.
 Winceham replied after weighing in his options for a moment.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That'll have to do then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the halfuin said and kicked hard and high, aiming for the sailor's jaw.
 Instead, he missed and his boot connected with the sailor's nose; a crunching
 sound was heard and blood spurted, some of it spilling on his boot.
 The sailor growled with pain and the next instant, a shout was heard from
 someone in the crew:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a free-for-all!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fists began flying and various instruments of sailmanship found new use
 as bruising, head-crushing implements.
 Stools and pegs were in good supply and eagerly used as well.
 Ned hadn't realised how easy it was for a gambling issue to escalate into
 a full-fledged fist-fight.
 They had only been out to space for a day, and yet the beer had run dry,
 and the crew was already fighting amongst themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wince? Stop monkeying around! These people are trying to help!

 Ned shouted, only to receive a muffled answer a little while later, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But it's my money now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of Winceham's voice trailed off into a dusty cloud of fists and
 brawlers' growls.
 He was well into the fight, and Ned knew that the captain of the HLS Maryland
 should be taking things into his hands sooner arather than later; unfortunately
 he discovered the captain was ostentatiously drunk, trying to steer the
 ship by using a strange mechanism that included a dead fish and one of
 those dangerous-looking, multicoloured cannonballs.
 He was having difficulty keeping the dead fish level on the rolling cannonball.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What the hell happened to rigor mortis, eh? Bloody useless fish.
 Throw'em out to dead space, I say!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Captain Peelpot urged noone in particular, and Ned sadly realised he was
 all alone, at least until the rest of the fleet arrived.
 Nede took the helm into his hands, smiling all the time at the captain
 who was looked at him with a wild-eyed look of confoundment and asked him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Come to me, my bristling sea-wench, smelling of salty toffee, wet like the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Captain Peelpot cried and throwing the dead fish aside, tried to grab Ned
 with arms open-wide and kiss him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was very nearly taken off-guard and side-stepped the drunk-like-a-bat
 captain at the last moment; he put out his foot and tripped him, but as
 Captain Peelpot was going down, he reached out a hand and grabbed Ned down
 with him.
 The prospect of being fondled on the deck of a very fast picket by a drunken
 captain of the Human League did not appeal to Ned who held on to the helm,
 making the ship roll with him abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship swerved violently and changed attitude and course as if some gigantic
 hand slapped its sides; and it was at that exact moment that Ned saw a
 blinding flash of purplish light fill the void of space above them, casting
 pinkish shades all over the ship.
 A great swath of light, like a flaming torrent of pure energy had missed
 them by a couple of seconds, Ned realised, and just a look made everything
 so much clearer and darker at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A huge oblong shadowy shape, stony black and flashing blue at times, was
 looming at an ever-decreasing distance, struts of jutting rock laden with
 bizarre crystal constructs.
 It was sort of terrible ship, shaped like a malevolent arrowhead of grim,
 dark stone and it was clearly on a collision course.

 situation.

 Captain Peelpot yelled as if waking up from a terrible nightmare, demonstrating
 surprising clarity and brio.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Captain Peelpot said in an orderly, commanding fashion, though still somewhat
 slurring his words.
 Ned was pleasantly surprised because they were still uncharred and alive,
 and the Captain seemed to know his stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you were dead drunk,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ned told the Captain with an approving smile, even as he gave the helm
 another random swing and push and the ship dived and swerved erratically,
 avoiding another swath of purple light, bright as the sun and wider than
 the main mast of the Maryland.
\end_layout

 the Captain said and shot Ned a glazed-eyed look that made him flinch instincti

 The Captain swerved the ship around and with the crew finally taking their
 places and Winceham panting on the deck, searching for his pipe, the Captain
 screamed in a maddening show of the power of intoxication:
\end_layout

Of course not! If we we were sure, we wouldn't be out there, caught in that

 the Captain said almost crying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, I thought so as much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned said and punched Captain Peelpot in the face, bringing him down on
 the deck, harmlessly but certainly painfully unconscious.
 Another great column of purple light missed the ship proper by a few feet,
 evaporating the top of the mast without so much as a sizzle.

The party continued on, through roughly cut tunnels and natural crevices.
 The tunnel system was filled with caves, large and small; housing room

 They hurried by, following a twisting and turning path as directed by Sisyphus

 He gave simple, short directions at every junction, and Bo hopped along

The boys weren't exactly restless but they could be heard whispering idly

 Invariably, Master Sisyphus turned and gave them a look, which somehow

 serious reprisals when the proper time came.

 The vision that filled everyone's eyes made them freeze in place, holding
 their breaths.
 Everywhere around the cave walls, there were strange, egg-like things clinging
 on to the rock and dirt like clams.
 Even in the stony pillars that held the ceiling, interspersed around the
 cave, these odd eggs lay, scaly and fish-like in appearance, yet trembling
 and pulsating like living things.

 With a straining effort she pulled him slightly upwards, before he could
 put one hand on a handle and feel his way up.
 Bo took care of the hatchlings with small pulses of fire shooting forth
 from her eyes, burning them to a crisp one by one without even singing
 Theo's hair.
 The next moment, Theo was lying down on the cistern's bed, hatchling-free.
 Right behind him, a couple or so hatchlings crawled their way up, hundreds

A sleek, fiery streak of light, metal and wood hurled itself accross the

 fire that threatened to burn down the main mast.
 The ship's hull glowed with a warm, at times fierce orange and silvery

 ship had been designed for.
 Unfortunately for them, the Ygg behemoth which closely resembled a sharp

 Ned added from a prone position on the deck, after a sudden violent lurch

Parcifal!

 he shouted out, his eyes searching for Parcifal frantically.
 He saw her then, at the stern of the ship, perched inside a huge throne-like
 enclosure, like a bird in a cage with a pretty hefty-looking cannon attached
 to the cage.
 Then the whole assembly she was using through all sorts of levers intricately
 connected to a whirring, rotating mass of cogs and rods, shook in its entirety
 as a violent, blinding, multi-hued coloured fireball shot forth from the
 cannon's muzzle in a show of sputtering fireworks.
 A moment or so later the shot landed at the Ygg ship, tearing down a jutting
 rock spire and stripping it away from the main ship, crumbling in the air
 as the turbulent air wrecked it to pieces.
 The Ygg ship seemed to have noticed, trying to swerve a moment too late,
 but only barely; it answered with a massive volley of violet bursts of
 raw energy in a square-grid pattern, its source a neatly packed, shiny
 mass of rough-hewn crystals.

 Ned yelled, running towards her, the mast behind him snapping in two like
 a badly burned firelog, just when Winceham put the Maryland in a violent
 downward spin.
 The sudden lurching motion threw everyone off their feet, except for Parcifal
 who was tied down in her cannon cage and Winceham who held on to the helm
 like the last mug of beer in the universe, his body going flat, in line
 with the deck.
 The rest of the crewmen were very professional about it all and simply

 their sailmanship and complete ignorance of danger.

 she said while another tap on her knee made her pull on the firing lever,
 and another fiery ball of light and destruction was hurled against the
 Ygg battleship and missed.
 The Ygg ship was steadily closing in and this time replied with a salvo

 Ned exploded, completely unaware of a deadly mass of iron in the shape

 Before he had time enough to speak a word, the fog lifted as if some giant
 hand pulled away a huge cover, and what they could now see, was something
 they didn't have time to imagine.

\begin_layout Standard
An Ygg was standing between the crewmaster and Parcifal, Encelados protruding
 from the monster's belly, its blue-on-blue eyes flickering with their dying

 couple of feet away from having their tentacled mouths on everyone's heads.

 Winceham screamed and took out his daggers, tumbled swiftly on the deck

 The Ygg turned around and with a throaty yell lunged at Winceham, its tentacles
 writhing morbidly.
 Ned went for his crossbow and loaded a bolt, before realising the Ygg warship

 a demonic spiders' head ready to spout its venom.

 Ned cried in anguish before springing into a sprint for the ship's helm.

He was too late.
 The Ygg warship let a volley of bright crackling energy rays head on in
 the Maryland's bow.
 The arcane crackling energies flashed violet and bored through the HLS

The ship keeled slightly to its left and began a whimpering freefall, bereft

The whole ship fell finally apart with a loud cracking, whipping noise and

Parcifal folded her arms and fell downwards like a brick, surpassing everyone

 Their eyes were sharp and clean, bereft of fear.
 Ned had closed his eyes, his legs splayed and his arms wide.
 Winceham was trying to steady himself in the air, fumbling for his tobacco
 pouch; remembering his tobacco pouch had been cut in half, he rolled his

 From her back, a leathery protrusion grew into an ever-expanding tail.
 Her chest became swollen and her sides writhed as if a newborn was about

 Her face was cast in a reverend agony, while her feet and hands began to
 grow talons.
 Her clothes were ripped apart even as her head became elongated, her forehead
 becoming a bony, enlarged plate.
 Her nose turned into a snout and her skin turned into a leathery, deeply-scaled
 hide, red and orange, the colour of fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the span of a few heartbeats, she had turned fully into a dragon, red

 Winceham whispered mostly to himself as he twisted his head around to see
 Parcifal, in her dragonform, twist in the air gracefully and clutch Ned
 easily in one of her claws.
 He then saw her coming for him, swooping down like a majestic predator.
 He was confused, feeling unsure whether or not he'd been kind enough to
 Parcifal for her not to rip him apart, possibly claiming it was only a
 mistake afterwards.

The bow of the mighty Human League warship appeared out of the clouds forcefully

\begin_layout Standard
Theo was standing in the middle of a rough circle formed by the rest: Lernea
 was down to her last few arrows, and Bo couldn't shoot her fireballs fast
 enough and barely had enough thaumaturgy left in her to hop around.
 Damon and Fintias were using their slings and blowpipes to little effect,
 while Master Sisyphus was quietly contemplating their situation.
 Everyone's feet were wet, except for Theo who was hovering above the waters
 of the shallow lake uncannily, as if praying solemnly.
 Around them, hundreds of Ygg were closing in, marching instead of charging,
 as if they were biding their time, revelling in the promise of the coming
 slaughter.

 Fintias looked at Damon then with a sorrowful grin, his green eyes having

 Fintias said and reloaded his sling with a pebble from the Hallowed Lake,
 letting it fly hard against an Ygg a few yards away.
 The pebble struck the Ygg in his mouth, whereas it begun choking and convulsing

 Others quickly replaced their fallen kin and followed in its steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Damon first and then Fintias felt a harsh, bony thing hit them hard against
 their cheeks, followed by a slapping sound.
 It was Master Sisyphus, who had shown them once again the back of his hand,

 partaking in a silent, slow dance with death itself, every movement sombre

 Sisyphus exclaimed and his face instantly returned to an unusually calm
 look of deep introspection.
 He then looked at the sky, and noticed that higher up near the clouds,
 a dozen or maybe more dark spots were being brilliantly lit from, flashes
 of light of various colours dousing them in a flame-like appearance.
 Then he noticed the flapping wings of a red dragon, and his thin, craggy
 lips curled into a tight smile.

 Lernea said and looked behind Theo, exchanging a knowing glance with her
 former Master and mentor.
 She knew then he wasn't talking about the Ygg - he looked up and saw the
 large red dragon coming down right on top of them, behind her, higher up
 into the clouds, strange-looking blots that were probably some kind of
 ship, literaly having a blast.

For a moment she thought when it was the last time she had seen a dragon

Parcifal spat a gush of fire from her snout, engulfing a row of Ygg in writhing
 flames, their raspy throats letting out otherworldly growls of dying pain.
 Her attack cleared some space in front of Lernea, while she flapped her
 wings quickly, breaking hard and releasing Winceham and Ned from a couple

 the shallow bottom of the lake with their faces.

 A shot of bright blue light like thunderflash cut a swath of Ygg down like
 a reaper's giant scythe.
 It was Sisyphus, who was looking at his staff with a sad, pitiful gaze.
 Winceham and Ned got back on their feet, Ned loading his crossbow with

 charged headlong against the oncoming wave of the Ygg, cutting a path through
 them even as the monstrous abominations tried their best to slashh and
 pierce them with their claws, their tendrils aiming to grab them in any

 Lernea hacked, swiveled and pierced the monsters, while Parcifal swiped

The sisters were a terrible sight to behold, looking invincible, a powerful

 Damon cried in terror, while Fintias popped up from behind him and snuck

 A moment later the claws of an Ygg were dug deep in his neck, his tentacled
 maw attached to the back of the man's head.
 His eyes twitched and rolled impossibly, his face chock-full of mortal
 horror, even as his eyes were drawn inside from their sockets, the contents
 of his head sucked through the Ygg's maw.
 A heavy cutlass struck clean against the Ygg, its head rolling while still
 alive, its tentacles still writhing with the splendour of a fresh kill.
 The crewmaster looked at the Ygg with disgust as its body lay slumped against
 the empty husk of the crewman who had just asked for his due break.

 Winceham suggested as he unstuck his daggers from a dead Ygg, tumbling

 Ned shot his crossbow at point-blank range, felling two Ygg with one bolt.
 He swerved to the side and dodged a dozen or so tendrils aiming for his
 waist, before kicking the Ygg hard in the face, making it dizzy for just
 enough time to hack at its head with a machete.
 The first hack dug deep; the second and the third made the killing a nasty,

It was at that moment that everyone felt a wave of pressure overcoming them,
 feeling it reverberate through their bones.
 They saw the Ygg then tremble, growling in agony for a moment before succumbing

 stalks of grass blown against the wind.
 Theo fell down awkwardly with a splash as well, planting his feet in the

Their timing is rather, fanciful, wouldn't you agree, my lady?

 Fintias said eagerly, readying his sling.

Not yet.
 You'll know soon enough if it comes to that,

 Sisyphus replied.

Well, I guess you can now have the rest of your break, lads,

 the crewmaster said and the crew sat down in the shallow water, the water
 up to their waist as their buttocks touched the pebble-bed floor.

\begin_layout Standard
The small host of riders galloped at an easy pace, the horses' hooves splashing
 in the water in a strange, perfect rhythm.
 A man wearing the Jangdrival's colors over a shiny full-plate armor was
 at the head of the host, all in all no more than a dozen riders.
 Beside him rode a bannerman, flying the colours of the Jangdrivals proudly,
 on top of the Nomos crest, the Holy Mountain, embroidered in gold and silver
 cloth.

Halt!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the leader of the host ordered and dismounted, a comfortable few yards
 away from Lernea and Parcifal.
 Eying them intensely, he walked towards them at an easy pace, his bannerman
 close behind.
 The rest of them remained mounted.

 Ned asked Winceham in a puzzled whisper, looking at him having a smoke
 in a borrowed pipe.

I'm having my two-minute break,

 Winceham replied unfazed, forming small circles of puffy smoke with his
 lips twirled in an 'o'.

 Lernea replied, shooting her sister a disapproving look.

Well, what did you expect? I was in dragonform!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she hissed and feeling somewhat self-conscious she asked,

I wonder why Winceham isn't ogling at me.
 Or any of them at all, for that matter.

I've spent my last iota of thauma on a very thin illusion.

You're correct in your assumption, Mr.

 Master Sisyphus said, standing close by.

Stubborn animals, humans,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the Jangdrival said and in an instant his body warped and twisted itself
 violently, revealing the true form of an Ygg, the men in his company doing
 the same, and the horses transforming into large carapaced abyssal terrors,
 with large bulging eyes and a mass of tendrils with enormous reach.

 asked a crewman right before he was grabbed by one of the tentacled monsters
 and swallowed in half.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anyone else have any stupid questions, you scallywags?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the crewmaster intoned, brandishing his cutlass, before the Ygg and their
 mounts charged at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is tactically unsound,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said grumpily.
 Ned shot a bolt smack against an Ygg's face - but it was silently absorbed,
 like the body of an Ygg was made of some sort of sponge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's not normal,

The crystal,

 Bo sent to everyone who could hear her,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The crystal!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sisyphus said as well, as if he had a sudden realization, and he produced
 the crystal from his robes, attaching it deftly to his staff's tip, like
 popping it into a make-shift receptacle.
 Bo saw what Sisyphus was trying to do and skipped and hopped towards him,
 while the Ygg were charging at them in full force.
 Parcifal readied Encelados while Lernea stood their ground, never showing
 whether or not it mattered to them that the Ygg now seemed to be impervious
 to damage.
 Winceham got up and and put his pipe in his vest's pocket, looking quite
 pissed at not being able to smoke in peace.
 The two boys looked at Master Sisyphus as his lips began to whisper words
 they had never heard before.

 Fintias asked, readying a shot.

Maybe it doesn't matter anymore,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Damon said to his friend and shrugged casually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo jumped right in front of the staff then, at the exact moment a thin,
 steady line of light not thicker than a hair's breadth shot through her.
 And then a surge of power and light created a sphere of magnificent light,
 crackling with a never seen before force surrounded Bo and Sisyphus.
 In a frozen bubble of time, the sphere expanded, shining with a light that
 tore shadows apart, shredding them to pieces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once it reached the boundaries of the Ygg crystal, the sphere of light collapsed
 in a single point centered at Bo.
 The next moment, a brilliant blinding white light exploded from the bunny,
 engulfing the lake, the crystal, and everyone else in a miniature sun.

Higher above the lake, in the clouds, Judith saw the fiery explosion of
