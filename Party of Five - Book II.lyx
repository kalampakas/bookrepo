\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
I couldn't really find a working subtitle for this first book in what's
 to become a series.
 Arguably, it's not a book per se (meaning not a full length novel), but
 a book it is still.

Party of Five
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 starts off with this book here, and I envision it as a series of novellas
 that I want to keep writing, evolving the characters and the world as I
 go.
 I could do that it in a full length novel, but it's much easier for me
 to write smaller, self-contained adventures that are linked together through
 the same characters, being fresh and different each time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left

\size footnotesize
Plus, I think a series of novellas can reach an audience faster and it easier
 and more practical (hopefully more fun) to read for most people.
 It is also my opinion that the novella as a genre, needs some more love
 from authors and readers alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I dearly hope you'll come to like the characters enough to wait for the
 next novella in the series.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the first part of this one, we start off in space, where the party is
 pretty much bored and nothing much of interested has happened, with the
 exception of Ned writing down lyrics and jokes, and Theo practicing magic
 with the bunny.
 When they arrive at the docks at Tallyflop, our heroes try to negotiate
 the berthing charge which is essentially a rip-off from the goblin dockmaster.
 They are not allowed to disembark, cannons and various other weapons trained
 on them.
 Dialogue ensues with the goblin until they see no wait out but to sell
 the good ship (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mary's Whatchamaccalit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) to cover the cost and be allowed to dock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Tallyflop is a majestic huge oak tree floating in space, the various branches
 acting as docks, and harbors for larger and smaller ships.
 Transportation is conducted via a complex system of pulleys, ran by the
 Central, which also covers as the administrative and technical center for
 Tallyflop, and it is run by goblins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once they sell the ship they decide to split: Ned and Winceham try to gather
 information about the elves and connect with shady characters in shady
 bars, getting hammered.
 Word gets around they've been asking questions and a doppelganger is sent
 after their trail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The sisters take it upon themselves to carry Culliper and the other pirate
 to some sort of justice.
 There is none other system than the Pit, where those that seek to be righted
 pit themselves against each other in a swashbuckling contest to the death,
 complete with taunts and the like (ala Monkey Island).
 The loser is forced to walk the plank into space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theo and the rabbit are left to care for finding a ship - with the coin
 they can afford they can find nothing except when they happen upon Reylando
 Lettifer's shipwright, a bear with a monocle, who considers him an artist
 first and an engineer, scientist and thaumaturgist second (thaumaturgy
 is what makes the engine stuff work).
 He is touched by the elves' plight and offers Theo the opportunity to take
 away a small ship that needs a bit of work, and while they work on it together,
 there is this zen side of Reylando that vibrates with theo and the Jah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Part Two, Parcifal is walking the plank after having lost from Culliper.
 The crowd is restless, and Lernea is nowhere to be seen.
 Just before Parcifal gets the literal mechanical boot that will shoot her
 into space to suffocate, Lernea rushes in overheard and picks her up.
 They evade but the crowd goes wild, trashes everything the sisters just
 keep running
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ned and Winceham are trying to recover from the hangover, when Winceham's
 paranoia turns out to be the doppleganger.
 They form a plan to lure him in with offering to sell Theo's crystal.
 While talking the neutralise him and force him to spill the beans about
 the elves and who is on their trail.
 They learn the name of the monster that had posed as Hobb, or at least
 the one with which it went by more freely at tallyflop: it's real name
 is Vrexxzloth.
 The doppelganger though wasn't the only one on their trail: A lone Arcane
 (blue tall bleak guy without humor) seeks them out and wants to sell them
 the info they need on Vrexxzloth.
 They accept ad enter a binding soul contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theo has an unexplained affinity about fixing the ship that amazes Reynaldo.
 Theo shows him the amulet and he talks about the legend of Umria and a
 planet were once the focus of the universe was balanced in.
 That crystal is part of that planet, now thought to be lost.
 Theo feels there some connection with his father.
 That's when Ned and Winceham show up and tell Theo what happened and that
 the sisters are in danger.
 With that in mind, Bo sets off hurriedly.
 When they follow him, they find out the sisters were actually lauded as
 great performers of the swashbuckling art.
 Still Culliper has wandered free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Part Three:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They need to enter Central which is right at the root of the giant oak.
 They enter through the bulk of the hollowed out tree, with reynaldo helping
 them out, his license as a shipwright and thaumaturgist on the line.
 They descend the levels to find out that the really integral part of the
 Central is restricted and is actually a small city of illithid's, creating
 magical weapons using Tallyflop as a staging and resource gathering point,
 and Central's energy, a small sun, as a manufacturing power plant.
 They stealth their way in until theo gives their position away again.
 Reynaldo fights some of the illithid guards.
 They then set a number of slaves free including the elves and then the
 others make their way to the portal controls, through traps and guards
 alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Using the arcane's instructions they reset the portal generator and the
 whole root of Tallyflop turns into a portal to the asteroid field where
 the illithid elder brain operates from.
 They board the ship and fly off into it, to book III.

\end_inset

I've never really understood all those planet-bound folk that look at the
 night sky all starry-eyed and gaze at it with a superbly idiotic grin and
 lose their grip on reality, making up all sorts of ideas about what space
 is like.
 I'll say this just once, hopefully some of you cadets are dead drunk not
 to notice the mistake you just made; space is boring, unforgiving, empty
 and a lot bigger than it looks like.
 A real lot.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was leaning against the upper deck railing, gazing at the milky blue
 sheen of a swarm of stars that showered the ship with a fuzzy, moon-like
 glow.
 For the last few days, ever since they'd sailed into the stars, a strange
 smile seemed to occupy his face for most of his waking time, while in his
 sleep all he could see was the glitter of stars, and the image of his father
 waving at him encouragingly to move on into a beautiful unknown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship moved in dead silence; one could only surmise it was really moving
 at all because of the twinkle of the stars as their light bounced off the
 metal ramrod in its prow.
 Winceham was snoring heavily nearby, occupying a simple hay bed he'd brought
 from below deck, while Parcifal kept a mindful, worried eye at Lernea's
 handling of the ship, who looked utterly and totally bored to death.
 Theo and Bo were shooting fireworks far off astern and seemed unequivocally
 happy.

It's wonderful, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned to no-one in particular, and for a rather awkward amount of time,
 noone bothered to reply.
 At length, Parcifal turned her head and looked at him morosely, her hands
 folded behind her head as if surrendering to the uneventful, humdrum quagmire
 that she felt their journey was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What, exactly, do you find wonderful?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said with a monotone voice.
 Ned pointed to the vastness of space surrounding them and replied in earnest:
\end_layout

All this.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

This,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and nodded to a random patch of blackness, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

is a void.
 A nothingness.

\end_inset

Please, not another one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal with a worried, sickly frown and a thrust-out open palm.
 Ned was truly puzzled, and it showed both in his voice and the sudden jerk
 of his neck.

I'm not in the mood.
 Gracious Skrala, not now, not ever,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal and failing to find the north in a place where it meant absolutel
y nothing, she sighed and made the warding gesture of Skrala.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Mood is a thing for cattle, and love-making,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a grumby, muffled voice said without warning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Winceham, half-asleep yet instantly aware of what was being said,
 his rogueish instincts always at the ready.
 Lernea's hard, solemn face changed abruptly to that of a radiant, noble
 lady such as her lineage would demand of her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She said, or rather announced with a beaming voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mr.
 Winceham, I think that now, as they saying goes, she's all yours.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't want to intrude on your persons miladies.
 I think she's rather tall, too young and inexperienced for me taste, not
 to mention somewhat lank on the waist,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Winceham, with his face still buried in the soft cloth mattress
 filled with hay.
 Parcifal looked at the short halfuin with a perplexed frown, before she
 came to realise he was referring to her; her boot shortly thereafter connected
 with the halfuin's behinds, shoving him off the cot and onto the hard deck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My waist is fine by all accounts, thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal looking mildly annoyed.
 Winceham picked himself up sporting a grin of mischief and no ill feelings,
 while Ned added, from an entirely different train of thought:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you saying, my singing is bad? Because, if I recall correctly, it worked
 like magic with the pirates and the ape-men.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which is to say,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 interjected Lernea, strolling around the deck stretching her back, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's fit for animals and scum.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no-one at the helm, a matter which was soon made entirely apparent
 to everyone as the ship began to slowly list to port.
 Just as Parcifal walked over to grab the helm, a look of annoyance on her
 face, she saw Bo flying accross the air as if falling slowly sideways,
 his fluffy ears shooting in strange directions, firm and upright as if
 frozen by an amazing sense of danger.
 Theo followed close behind, smiling as broadly as a child left to its devices
 alongside a cookie jar.
 Parcifal stood baffled, while Theo grabbed the helm as he flew past it,
 turned the ship back on its proper course and twisted his body to settle
 his feet on the ground with the grace of a dancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And, it seems now I can fly!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said proudly, while Bo could be seen a few feet away, happily munching
 on an oversized leek with awe-inspiring veracity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned exclaimed on cue:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's space! It's so grandiose, so alluring.
 Anything is possible, see?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and pointed at a levitating Theo with a gleaming smile.
 Winceham and the Teletha sisters did not seem to share in the enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's what you've been saying for the past two weeks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and let herself slump to the cot with a weary sigh.
 Parcifal added with some real concern:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not to mention that all we're navigating blind, based on that scum's word
 alone.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper lay in shackles in the hold; he'd told them as much as he knew
 himself.
 He had been told to raid the village and that he would collect his pay
 at Tallyflop.
 Even though Parcifal almost convinced the rest to throw him overboard and
 use him as target practice, cooler minds had prevailed.
 Ned though very troubled about what to do with his father's killer, did
 not want to have his blood on his hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He'd be a fool to try and swing us.
 We'll reach some kind of port, at some point.
 That's for sure.
 Food and water is aplenty though, no worries there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham scratching his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, what if we're walking into a trap?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Parcifal, shaking her head, looking agitated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would be sailing into a trap,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 corrected Lernea from her cot, without bothering to take her arm off her
 shut eyes.
 Theo said with confidence, even as he kept the ship on course with little
 effort:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think everything's as it should be.
 Bo isn't the least bit nervous,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and toyed with the bunny's ears, Bo wriggling with pleasure on
 Theo's shoulder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bo is a bunny, Theo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal with a voice that teetered on the brink of a shrill.
 Theo wasn't taken aback and insisted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Well, I trust his instincts.
 You'll see.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Believe me, I'm dying to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal, brandishing her lack of humor for everyone to see, as if
 it were Encelados, her trusted blade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Harsh words in haste can oft be bad in taste,

 said Winceham in a sing-along voice as he produced his smoking pipe and
 pouch from a vest pocket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought Ned was the poet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea with a puzzled voice and a childish frown.
 Ned was sincere in what he thought was an apology:
\end_layout

I hate to disappoint, but I do not do free verse.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, Svarna be my guide, there's hope for our ears yet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Parcifal in an utterly disenchanted manner.
 Ned was beginning to realise his talents were being judged too harshly,
 all too unfairly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You keep making these remarks about my singing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I thought you'd never notice.
 Frankly, I'd prefer you kept those kinds of performances to yourself,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and sat down on the deck, legs crossed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's what I do, Parcifal.
 I perform,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned.
 It was obvious in his stricken face he felt more hurt than offended.
 Parcifal drove home what sounded like a thinly-veiled insult:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, it would be more beneficial if you tried your hand at something else.
 A man without a sword is like a cup riddled with holes: useless.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham lit his pipe, drew heavily and added as smoke left his nose and
 mouth freely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

And dry as hell to boot.
 Cut the lad some slack, milady; he's more than proved his usefulness when
 that monster had us at his maw.

You're being unfair, sister.
 You stood there frozen, incapacitated, just like the rest of us.
 Except Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and pointed a blind finger at Theo, missing Ned wildly.
 Parcifal unsheathed Encelados and dutifully began to check the blade in
 detail, from all angles.
 It looked sharp as ever in the starlight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would still think that was a freak occurrence.
 It has never happened to me before,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said, seemingly without giving the incident much thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, there's a first time for everything, milady.
 Maybe you're too young to know better.,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and looked away, drawing on his pipe, trying to look innocent,
 yet a grin and a pout full of mischief adorned his face.
 Parcifal was quick to answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is that another one of your sexual innuendos? Mother always said men are
 immature.
 I had no idea she meant old people as well.

I'm not that old mind you.
 I don't usually brag about it, but I could keep a lady up all night,

 said Winceham and secretly wished he could remember the last time that
 had happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It must be the snoring,

 Lernea said matter-of-factly, and Parcifal grinned without a word, her

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Ned suddenly and pointed a finger, his excitement threatening to
 tear his face apart.
 Everyone turned thier heads as if silently obeying an order.
 A moment or so passed before Parcifal asked with a somewhat surreptitious,
 wary look, her hand drawn to Encelados' hilt on its own:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 shouted Ned without taking his eyes off the trembling, pointy source of
 light.
 Bo's eyes lit up like a blowing furnace all of a sudden and he made sure
 he had Theo's full attention, jumping up and down around the ship's steering
 wheel.
 The elf knew the bunny meant business so he brought the ship's bow to bear
 dead on where Bo pointed with his whole body, much more like a hunting
 dog than an innocent-looking herbivore would.

Lernea spared a moment or so to take a look as well, barely standing straight

Parcifal looked at the star, growing subtly larger with every passing moment.

 She said to Theo:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Preposterous.

Wnceham turned and looked at Theo rather confounded, yet approving of his

Well said, lad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham smiled at Theo, who in turn bowed lightly towards the halfuin.
 The brief moment of well-earned flattery made Parcifall roll her eyes and
 sigh.
 Winceham, always prowling about to boost his ego in many small ways that
 to him added up to enormous amounts, was about to make a sly, wry comment
 on the virtuous of proper language and etiquette, the grin on his face
 a sure sign he was going to enjoy it no matter what Parcifal's reaction
 was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To his surprise though, the only words that came out of his mouth when his

 proper language and much less, etiquette:

Parcifal spent a moment with her flustered face stuck in a deep frown, trying

 Her finger was already raised in a warning when she looked at Winceham

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal only had to look upwards to see both Theo and Bo were looking up
 as well, their faces and fur respectively strangely illuminated, standing
 perfectly still like under some sort of enchanting spell.
 Her hand instictively went for Encelados' once more but half-way it froze
 as well: the sight in front of her eyes had captivated her very soul, and
 the souls of everyone else as well, it seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were sailing under a majestic field of starlight; rivulets of stardust
 and beams of light wafted down from above, where the giant gnarly branches
 of an old, wizened tree dominated the starscape.
 Where before there had been nothing, now the ship felt like it drifted
 onwards like a butterfly loitering around a blooming flower.
 They gracefully soared by clusters of huge green leaves, easily the size
 of a hamlet or small village.
 The huge leaves emanated a faint greenish glow, while in the distance all
 around them, more and more leaves and branches appeared little by little,
 like some omnipotent invisible hand was clearing up a fog-stained window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Swaths of light and soft shadows crept over them at an easy pace as the
 ship continued on its course, as if it sailed under a soft, thin, silken-colour
ed bedding the likes of which every child would only ever hope to dream
 about; a tunnel of light and shadow had manifested itself on top of a playful,
 shining net that tossed and writhed about in a beautiful dance that seemed
 to have a breath of its own.

 of nearly parallel branches that seemed to lead them on like the walls

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then suddenly, literally out of nowhere, a ship the shape of a bumblebee
 and easily twice the size of the

Mary Watchamacallit
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 appeared at her prow; ridden with holes and clumsy patches of copper plating
 and shoddy, badly trimmed sails, it looked more like a flying collection
 of scrap.
 The fact that a ship like that could also sail into space made the whole
 endeavor of traveling through the stars acutely unremarkable all of a sudden.
 It wouldn't have drawn everyone's attention with a snap if it wasn't for
 the pair of large harpoons trained on the

 The oversized sharp implements of hunting and warfare were manned by unruly

sly extravagant goggles and leather helmets and sadly, nothing more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's an ambush!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Parcifal and clutched Encelados defiantly with both hands, warily

 to materialise.
 The blade though, remained a shiny grey steel color; it did not give off
 its glow of warning.
\end_layout

It certainly looks like an ambush,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham not knowing whether he should ready his stiletto or finally
 have a try at space swimming, which in retrospect did not seem like a dangerous
 waste of time.
 Theo remained silent exchanging some oddly thoughtful looks with Bo, even
 if that meant mainly staring at the rabbit's frenzied twitching nose.
 Its eyes though did not flare up; a mayhem seemed an evermore distant possibili

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Theo gave Ned a flat shrug, failing to see an answer was not expected of

\begin_layout Standard
A cough, a loud buzz and a shrieking noise were heard before the voice died
 down.
 The little green creatures wearing the goggles seemed to be enjoying this
 immensely, judging from the way they giggled and toyed around with the
 oversized harpoon launchers; crude-looking contraptions but menacingly
 sharp and shiny nonetheless.
 One of the crew jumped off the goblin ship holding a thick rope in hand;
 a towing line.
 The little goblin was wearing nothing but a toothless grin.

 said Winceham stroking his beard, his eyes trying to focus where the goblin's

 Lernea scratched her head and straightened her back before opening her
 eyes wide enough to let what has happening around her sink in.
 In a moment of sudden, angst-ridden clarity she exclaimed:

 As both ships moved closer to the immense trunk that was still a bit hazy,

 a mix of oil, walnuts and grog gone bad.

 Ned wished he could do more than sigh, but it would have to do.

\begin_layout Standard
The air inside the goblin dockmaster's office had a nearly suffocating quality.
 The atmosphere felt thick as oil, yet it smelled of ink and rough, cheap
 paper.
 Tallyflop's dockmaster's office was built inside a hollowed out section
 of the giant oak's skin.
 Its walls rose steeply into a dark, shadowy place with no ceiling in sight.
 Goblin helpers and staff could be seen running atop tiny overhead railings,
 metal grates, through glass pipes, along rope bridges and wooden ladders.
 The almost always insidious looking creatures appeared and disappeared
 through small trapdoors built in the wooden walls.
 Sniggering like madmen at times, they carried large stacks of papers strapped
 on their back and were invariably naked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea's look darted around uncomfortably.
 It was as if she felt soiled by merely standing there.
 Parcifal had a brooding expression, her hands stuffed in her armpits, pouting
 like a child scorned.
 Winceham was looking intently at the stacks of papers and scrolls rising
 up into nothingness.
 He could make out the goblins criscrossing the room overhead with all the
 alacrity of rats in a cage.
 Stroking his fine beard, the odd look on his face meant he still wasn't
 sure about the goblins genitalia.
 He looked committed; he just had to know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bo sat on Theo's shoulder idly, practically asleep.
 The flames on his eyes were nowhere to be seen.
 Theo was silently trying to count the books and ledgers surrounding them;

 exclaimed Parcifal and red hot anger poured from her voice.
 The dockmaster raised his head and looked at her through the monocle, blinking
 eratically and trying - impossible though it seemed - to focus for a moment
 or two.
 He dived into the huge ledger in front of him again before answering.
 He waved a bony hand dismissively.

 The goblin wrecking crew were hoisting down the sails.
 Lernea looked behind her shoulder and saw a large metal barrel-like construct
 on wheels, pushed on a ramp.
 It had a number of saws and hatchets attached to it and left a trail of
 smoke as it vibrated violently on the 
\shape italic
Mary Whatchamacallit's
\shape default
 deck.
 The next moment it exploded with a muted thud, senting perhaps a dozen
 goblins flying off into space.
 A rush of maniac laughter and snot-brained giggling followed suit before
 the wrecking crew went back to what appeared to be work for goblins.

 Culliper rolled his eyes but noone was paying any attention to him, except

Ned shot the pirate a hard look.
 His jaw tightened and his face became ashen gray.
 It was a very misfortunate series of events that had led them all the way

A loud creaking sound was heard, followed by a couple of thuds and reverberating
 knocks.
 The floor vibrated somewhat, and grabbed almost everyone's attention, except
 for Ned and the dockmaster whose gazes were locked in a silent, mysterious
 struggle.
 Outside, at the pier, the goblin wrecking crew had just chopped off the
 main mast and were trying to peel off what had previously been a somewhat
 less flat goblin.
 There wasn't much laughter involved, at least not until the moment one
 of them brandished a bloodied spatula, much to the merriment of his co-workers.

Parcifal exploded with a shout, condemning the lack of logic behing the

Theo was now trying to count goblin parts and limbs flying off from the
 ship now and then, while Winceham's fascination with goblin genitalia seemed
 to come to an end.
 There was a glad look of relief on his smiling face when he shook his head
 as if everything finally made sense.

Ah, I see your friends here like to talk legalese.
 We're wrecking it because it's our bloody prerogative, ain't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Zed with what could've been a smile if it wasn't impossibly lopsided,
 the dockmaster's saw-like teeth failing to follow the geometry of the mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How are you going to get anything worthwhile from that ship by hacking it

 said Parcifal frustrated, while Ned looked engrossed in thought, his eyes
 wide shut.

You're not very experienced in the shipping business, are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 remarked Zed and added another blot of ink in the shape of goblin genitalia
 on some page on his ledger, before he turned the page and went back to
 trailing some other text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there a problem with that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal sharply and tried to approach the goblin threateningly.
 She moved about a couple of inches before bumping onto Ned's back.
 Her sister shook her head disapprovingly and motioned her to just stay
 put.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned can handle it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and after a look at Ned added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
Ned swallowed hard and nodded thoughtfully to himself before turning to
 look at the ship being hacked and sawed without a lot of regard for the
 craftmanship or the safety of the wrecking crew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're selling it for scrap, isn't that right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ned pointing at the dockmaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

If by scrap you mean firewood, that's right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Zed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Firewood? Isn't that liable to catch on fire? Fire is dangerous, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo suddenly and everyone looked at him as if realising for the first
 time he might not be actually aware of his surroundings most of the time.
 On the other hand, Bo seemed quite alert, yet his eyes weren't lit up.
 He simply wiggled his nose and scratched an ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It doesn't make much sense to hack down the whole supporting structure on
 top of which this city is built on.
 It'd be like turning a castle's foundations into a quarry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea nodding thoughtfully.
 Parcifal's face then suddenly lit up with a smile that meant an idea had
 been hatched in her head; she chose to remain silent though and grinned
 as if something wicked had crossed her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still, it can't be all that valuable.
 I mean, how much firewood does a city this size need? It's not like it's
 cold in space,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham with a shrug of his shoulders that went largely unnoticed,
 especially since he stood smack in the middle of them all, hardly able
 to breathe properly crammed as they were.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Steam engines,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned with a sudden flash of insight.
 The goblin nodded and tried to smile congenially but the end result was
 less than inviting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By steam you mean that thing that's like smoke, except it only appears to
 be around bathing houses and such?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham, a very uncertain expression painted on his face.
 He absent-mindedly scratched his chin, breadcrumbs falling off his beard.
 None bothered to answer him; they were rather trying to absorb the implicit
 declaration that the smell about Winceham wasn't just a matter of unfortunate
 timing, but rather a way of life.
 The minimal space of the dockmaster's office made it all but impossible
 to ignore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, now that we've got everything sorted out, would you be bloody kind
 enough to leave? Work just keeps piling up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the dockmaster and as luck would have it, a goblin passed overhead
 riding a small unicycle on a rope and tossed an impossibly thick book on
 a huge stack that came crushing down barely a moment later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What's a steam engine?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal with a quizzical expression.
 It was obvious she had never heard of such a thing before.
\end_layout

It's an apparatus that creates force applied to a system that can create

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo matter-of-factly and petted Bo behind the ears.
 The bunny seemed to concur, if one were an expert on reading whiskers.
 Theo's answer once again drew some weird looks but this time they were
 looks of surprise coupled with a failure to really understand what he was
 talking about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's what makes the ships fly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a face shaken by a sudden, acute realisation.
 He looked at Lernea and without uttering a word, he saw that same look
 mirrored in her face.
 She was at a loss for words for a moment.
 Zed was trying to look inconspicuous while eyeing a strangely illustrated
 centerfold page dangling from his ledger, containing fancy, dressed up
 goblins of indeterminate sex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not selling the metal bits as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea with a rather off-beat tone, as if she was being merely curious.
 Ned picked her train of thought, nodded and went a step farther:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll sell you Culliper in exchange for that metal chair down below.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone, except Parcifal, even Bo, looked at Ned like he had just admitted
 to being a large, furry whale dancing in a pot.
 Culliper did not even flinch; his stabbing stare was stuck on Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What chair?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the goblin looking suddenly quite intrigued.
 Zed started shuffling the pages in the ledger in front of him with furious
 speed, one eye searching the text on the pages and the other not daring
 to leave the naughty centerfold page out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned lad, that's bloody slavery,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham with a hushed, almost fearful voice.
 Lernea looked troubled, while Parcifal was still smiling, either lost in
 thought or staunchly approving of Ned's decision.
 The former queen of Nomos for a day looked at Ned with a pang of worry
 and told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Unless they throw him into a fire or something, that probably counts as
 slavery,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham out of turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes.
 I'm sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and shot a bland look at Culliper.
 The pirate's eyes looked like small, glistening beads.
 He made no effort to so much as croak a muffled pleading.
 Instead, it looked as if his mouth curled up in a wicked, sly smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dockmaster traced a very curly line of goblin handwriting with one crooked
 finger and said in a mumbling voice:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're selling Culliper as a slave for a grog dispenser?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham asked Ned with a feeling of awed respect in his voice and Theo
 - who rarely jumped in to actually help someone else understand - helpfully
 added with a smile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The grog dispenser was the strange barrel with the lever and the tap near
 the lavatory, down below in the hold, not the one in the back with the
 odd slot.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There was a lavatory?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham, sounding mildly suprised but otherwise unshaken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goblin gave the matter a small amount of thought while drool with the
 viscosity of tar started dripping off his mouth.
 He was looking at the centerfold page intently when wild-eyed and frenzied
 he suddenly cried 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Done!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and offered his hand to Ned.
 After a moment of reflexive hesitation, Ned shook it firmly; he then couldn't
 help but look at Culliper for a long, tense moment before he turned to
 leave.
 He fell on Parcifal and realised she was blocking the narrow, short exit.
 She was still lost in her own, grin-inducing thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What have you done, Ned?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea while Ned slid past Parcifal who was trying to squeeze herself
 into the wrong amount of space at the wrong moment.
 Once past the exit he looked at Lernea with what must've been guilt and
 told her:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's better than the alternative.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is it? That's not justice served, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she told him with consternation, her head raised slightly above the others
 as Winceham tried to squeeze through and out of the impossibly small office
 built into the giant oak itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I needed to do something about it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and shrugged slightly.
 Lernea bit her lip and shot a look at Culliper who was already being whisked
 away using a harness and a pulley, ever higher and higher by goblins hidden
 from sight.
 His ice-cold gaze sparkled away into the darkness; Culliper and Ned locked
 eyes.
 Ned felt like he had already made a terrible, unavoidable mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later, Winceham asked Ned even as the others left the crowded office
 with a bit more ease:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where are we going to find a new ship? What's so important about that chair
 anyway? Why did the ship have a lavatory?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe Theo can answer that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ned and Bo's eyes suddenly lit up, even as Theo bumped his head
 on the doorway and silently nursed his head with a thoughtful yet promising
 look, as if something new and wonderful had just happened.
 His fingers went for the crystal around his neck.
 The shimmer on its surface as light fell from all the thousands of lamps
 and fires around the innumerable tall branches all around, above and below,
 was the warm orange glow of a dear hearth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they stood outside the dockmaster's office, Parcifal was the last one
 to come out.
 She asked without really looking all too worried or indeed caring:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't find Culliper.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metal chair that had flown the `Mary Whatchamacallit' was being hoisted
 into the air and brought onto the promenade, near where they stood.
 At the same time a team of goblins fell into the void as the poor ship
 split in two after the last few beams that held its keel together were
 chopped off into splinters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned sold him to the dockmaster for that chair,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham, looking undecided on whether or not that was a good trading
 decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Excellent,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and walked along the promenade that slowly turned below like
 a corkscrew to a brilliantly lit, brightly coloured neighborhood where
 rowdy cheers and song could be heard, accompanied by the heady smell of
 fuel quality grog and an indistinct aroma of badly charred meat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where do you think you're off to, young lady?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 demanded Lernea with all the trained haughtiness of a queen and older sister.
 Her younger sister replied with her hands in her pockets, strolling about
 casually:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

To find a drink.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 to catch up with her.

 she said and pointed to the metal throne and with one hand and the giant
 oak all around behind them, before pleading, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned, say something!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 She sounded slightly panicked and her voice suddenly carried a lot less
 authority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Let them be, Lernea.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's been a very boring journey, that much is true,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea replied as she looked at the strange contraption in the form of
 a chair sitting squarely in front of her on the promenade, a couple of
 leather straps still dangling from it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could have given a few more performances if you'd only asked,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned in an apologetic fashion, looking suddenly all too self-conscious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I said boring Ned, not suicidal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea retorted and changed the subject even before Ned had time enough
 to protest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And how do you suggest we carry that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and Theo, who had been feeding Bo a thick stick of limegrass from
 one of his many pockets, inserted the crystal around his neck in the slot
 on the chair and by way of magic, it floated easily almost a foot above
 the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There.
 Nifty little thing this crystal, isn't it? I wonder how it actually works,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and his eyes turned into thin slivers as he peered over the throne.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With magic?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea and raised an eyebrow.
 Theo replied after a moment absorbed in thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It might be, it might be.
 But what kind of magic?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said in all seriousness, while Ned touched the chair and pushed it forward
 using just one finger.
 He shook his head approvingly and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

My sister always tends to act before thinking.
 If she had just waited to exchange a few simple words, we wouldn't need
 to spent more time to find her in that awful crowd down there,

 said Lernea and pointed to the massive marketplace chockfull of people
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's Parcifal alright,

 said Ned and walked beside Lernea at an easy pace, pushing the aloft chair
 alongside him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You mean near that blue bright glow dancing in the air down there?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo without realising the full implications of what he was seeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned and Lernea exchanged knowing, troubled looks and sprang to a running
 pace, while Bo jumped off Theo's lap, flames brilliantly wild in his eyes.
 The bunny easily outran them both in a few heartbeats.
 Theo then realised that something important was happening and decided he
 just might as well fly towards the glow instead of hopping along so inefficient
ly.
 He leapt off the promenade and into the vaccuum with the practiced ease
 of someone putting on his slippers.
\end_layout

By the time he realised something was slightly off, he was freefalling,

 Lernea had her back, arrows flying from her bow with a trained, fast pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now is not the time, really!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Phew! What a putrid smell!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, attracting aggravated looks from Ned even in the thick of
 battle.
 The halfuin would have made a comment if his senses hadn't alerted him
 to a new threat.
 He stepped on the ledge of the promenade and vaulted himself into the air
 with a backflip; the next moment he landed on the wooden floor, his tiny
 yet lethal blade stuck in the neck of an orc, vile green blood gushing
 in spurts as the orc toppled and fell off the promenade without so much
 as a gurgling sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That came close, Wince!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Ned as he reloaded his crossbow with a new bolt and aimed at two
 orcs, rushing the sisters with their bucklers raised.
 Ned took his time and let fly a shot; it missed wildly.
 The orcs drew their weapons, a murky blood-spat axe and a whaler's spear.
 Ned was already reloading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Incoming, lasses!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried Winceham and filled his sling with a hefty ball of lead; a memoir

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was locked in a swordfight with what must've been the gang's leader,
 a tall, brutish orc with a lisp, real mail and the nasty ability to dodge
 and parry like the devil.
 Lernea heard the halfuin's warning just in time; she loaded her bow with
 two arrows and knelt cooly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yer worth the money, ya ferretth!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the tall orc, as he parried yet another blow from Parcifal aimed
 squarely at the small gap between his helmet and his armor.
 Lernea held her breath and let the arrows fly even as the orcs were ready
 to leap onto her; in an instant, their weapons were flying harmlessly in
 the air with the rush of their wielders diminished all too sudden.
 The orcs were slumped against the floor, an arrow having pierced their
 skulls clean through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blathted windth o' Morrogah! I thould've athked for double the coin!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted the tall brute of an orc, dodged a blow that would've cut his arm
 off and managed to tackle Parcifal and drop her on the ground.
 The next instant came a blinding flash of light; thick smoke covered everything
 as far as anyone from the party could see.
 A mistimed flurry of missiles seemd to get absorbed into the cloud harmlessly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked Ned and coughed slightly as the thick smoke made it difficult to

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Now who's going to pay for all that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said a grumbling voice coming from somewhere outside the smoke cloud that
 was slowly clearing up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal stood back on her feet, panting.
 Encelados had never left her grasp.
 The blade was silver gray again, yet stained with dried, green orcish blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I couldn't land a single blow,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said in what was almost a whisper, her brow furrowed and sweaty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The promenade slowly returned to its more usual hubbub; the traders at the
 stalls picked up from they had left and started shouting their offers,
 while groups of sailors could be heard ordering new rounds of grog for
 everyone.
 Some even applauded the party as the smoke eventually cleared and cheered
 them for the well-performed fight.
 A couple even tossed some coin at Ned and Winceham's feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do they mock us?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Lernea as she rounded up her arrows from all the dead orcs lying

 Ned wasn't sure about the crowd's reaction.
 By the look on his face, he was troubled that deadly combat counted as
 entertainment for these people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Nah, they're just being appreciative.
 A good fight's always a good fight around places like these.
 The jokes helped as well,

 said Winceham offering his own perspective as he gathered any and all valuables
 the orcs carried on their persons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I didn't tell any jokes,

 The halfuin produced a pair of pliers from his belt and went for an orc's
 mouth.

 `Oddball' sounds rather demeaning.
 `Special' is much more appropriate.

 The two men began to load one of the bodies onto the cart.

Then suddenly an arrow got stuck on the pale-faced man's back.
 He slightly furrowed his brow, smiled, and fell on top of the body he was
 holding.
 Lernea took a step back reflexively and saw there was a note attached to
 the arrow.
 The other man in the robe observed a moment's silence and nodded to himself.

 The halfuin noticed, exhaled a puff of smoke and said with utmost sincerity:

***
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo opened his eyes in a dark, warm place.
 He blinked a couple of times until his eyes adjusted to the darkness.
 Still he saw nothing more than a faint orange glow caressing a crude opening.
 He felt his hands itch; he heard the sound of rustling leaves as he propped
 himself upwards on his hands.
 He was lying on a bed of oak leaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He remembered falling, trying to swim.
 And then the piers, the promenades and the ledges on the giant tree falling
 upwards.
 Or was it him that fell downwards, he wondered briefly.
 He got up and blindly staggered forward, with outstretched hands.
 He was looking for a wall or a lamp, anything that would illuminate his
 whereabouts in any helpful way.
 His eyes tried to pierce the darkness, without much success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the first few steps, the sound of leaves under his feet turned into
 a fuzzy feeling.
 There was fuzzy, soft grass under his feet.
 Then his hands bumped onto something soft and furry.
 It was warm and inviting to the touch, it felt strange yet familiar.
 Theo seeked its outline with both hands; it stretched onto a wide arc before
 it dipped downwards and then upwards again, like a rolling hill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I gather you're awake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said a deep, rumbling voice with a hint of annoyance, followed by a low-keyed
 snarl.
 No answer came from Theo for a few moments, while he thought about the
 question hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure.
 How can I tell if this isn't a dream?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo in absolute seriousness, his hands groping the soft furiness
 in front of him reflexively.
 He then felt a slap across his face that left him speechless, his hands
 frozen stiff, groping at nothing but air.
 There was a loud clap like wood meeting stone and then light suddenly poured
 from many points set around him.
 As light filled the emptiness it quickly defined a large enclosed grove,
 a floor covered in grass, flowers, tree-shapes and roots abounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo also became acutely aware that the voice belonged to a nine-foot tall
 bear in a toga.
 He looked at his hands and realised they were the same height as the bear's
 behinds.
 The bear lowered its head and seeked eye contact with Theo.
 The elf raised his eyes almost involuntarily and their gazes locked.
 The bear had a stern, crystal-clear shine about its eyes, like a spotless
 mirror.
 A said with an elevated sense of importance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 asked Theo befuddled, nursing a flush-red cheek.
 The bear nodded slightly, and its whole bulk shook in tune.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Question everything; that is the path of balance.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The words came effortlessly, as if recited.
 There was approval in the bear's gravely voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is that path?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo, his eyes darting all around the floor, literally searching for
 some kind of path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Within,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the bear and bowed slightly, hands pointing to its huge chest, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and without,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it added with hands outstretched.
 Theo was clearly confused.
 He barely managed a word, purely out of trying to appear polite, especially
 since he had - however inadvertently - grabbed the bear's behinds not a
 minute earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ah.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear motioned for Theo to lay on the ground as it did so as well.
 Theo sat down on a patch of grass, right beside a small, delicate tree.
 Water ran under it in a small stream not wider than the palm of a man.
 The bear sat near the old, mossy bark of the wooden walls.
 Its voice, reverberated serenely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please, sit.
 Let us share.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo searched his robe's pockets and felt embarassed to find nothing but
 a piece of lint to share.
 He then realized the crystal was in that strange chair and Bo was nowhere
 around.
 He suddenly felt a chill rise up his spine.
 A terrible feeling of loneliness overcame him.
 The bear asked gently:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you thirsty, friend?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there a wrong answer?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo with some alarm in his voice.
 A grin formed on the bear's mouth.
 It seemed surprisingly happy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Indeed.
 There is no wrong answer; there is no right question.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear nodded with a wide grin and flexed its torso around in an astonuding
 show of agility.
 It reached for a couple of bear-sized cups perched on a natural shelf along
 the walls.
 He offered one cup to Theo who held it in both hands much more like a jar.
 The bear put its cup down on the ground and made a gesture with both arms
 stretched across its chest.
 The fingers on its palms were matched, forming some kind of winged shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A loud hum then started to reverberate outwards from the bear's chest, in
 a rhythmic pattern.
 The humming stopped before it became too loud for comfort.
 Theo was about to ask for a smaller cup when suddenly a swarm of insects
 filled the grove.
 They danced around them with a benign, almost melodic buzz.
 They looked like tiny sparkles of glittering raindrops fluttering in the
 air.
 Then the swarm split in two and dove away like one mass in each cup, spinning
 wildly inside them.
 The next moment, their shininess had vanished and they had become little
 ember specks, vanishing as swiftly as they had appeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear raised its cup and bowed slightly.
 It then opened its eyes and cocked its head in a manner which implied it
 was either having a good time or was right about ready to rip the living
 flesh out of Theo.
 Sadly, it was neither as the bear soon scratched its head involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My name is Tejwel Al-Dub.
 May the desert be fruitful,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the bear and drank the cup in one go.
 Theo looked at his own cup and saw a wonderful, golden-hued liquid sloshing
 easily about the cup, starry like the sea at summertime.
 Theo took a careful, measured sip.
 His mouth felt like an ocean tide ridden with flowers, his stomach felt
 placated and full, his heart felt warm and his mind was at ease.
 It felt like drinking the stuff of dreams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't really see how a desert could be fruitful.
 I hate to sound rude, though I fear grabbing your behind doesn't make a
 good first impression, but what is this stuff?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo blatantly, with just the right amount of solid naivety and amazement.
 The bear smiled heartily, its eyes nearly lost in their furried sockets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The past is always gone from sight, friend.

\begin_layout Standard

The loud, corny music stopped every time something or someone was flung

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea and stare at the ogre meaningfully, letting her words sink
 in with as much a sense of innuendo as possible.
 She laid herself back on the rather uncomfortable chair and tried to smile
 wryly.
 The rather uncomfortable seat coupled with the unruly, ugly company at
 their table split her smile in something akin to a cringe and a mentally
 retarded grin.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wha'at did she 'ay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the ogre through its cave of a mouth, its teeth a purely decorative
 add-on.
 The ogre was the fat, grey-green sort, a typical example of its kind; its
 rotund belly was a good indicator that actually chewing food was not a
 prerequisite for ogres.
 Especially ogres that were usually employed as muscle in the various nefarious
 trading agreements that were all too common in Tallyflop.

 After making a show of washing his mouth with the house special, Mythriam's
 Loxsene Famous Grog, he swallowed, felt a bit queasy for a moment and fell
 of his stool.
 Lernea barely spared Wince a fleeting yet chastising gaze and returned
 her full undivided attention to the ogre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she asked with her eyebrow furrowed in a way that implied a conniving,
 insidious sort of discussion was taking place.
 The ogre was scratching a layer of crust made out of some sort of fungi
 on its belly; it completely missed the delicately contrived facial expression.

Well then, do you know of anyone who does?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The ogre gave it a bit of thought.
 It scratched its belly once more and a piece of skin peeled off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Yea,

 Lernea's veneer of delicate handling of the whole information gathering

Lernea sighed.
 She was a staunch believer of diplomacy, but it looked like they were wasting

 She was about to grab Winceham from the belt and drag him away with her,

 looking top notch and not at all positively smashed.

\begin_layout Standard
It then indeed proceeded to hit himself in the head with its powerful fist.
 Its eyes went rolling for a while and its head swerved this way and that,
 the eyes trying to see through a blurry vision.
 He raised a blotched hand with two fingers extended, and hit itself in
 the head once more.
 It nearly passed out, but it stood its ground in the chair.
 At length, after it could focus its eyes once more, the ogre spoke again.
 There was a recognizable amount of hurt in its voice:

Winceham patted the ogre gently on one bucklered knee with a metallic pang.

 he said reassuringly and went on.

Listen, do you have any idea who did a hit on this blue, green ogre a while
 back? Say a minute or so earlier?

Winceham nodded to Lernea with a smile and offered his hand.
 The gesture went unnoticed, as the ogre was now eating some of the pinkish
 fungi shaped like tiny carrots growing on its belly.

It's been a pleasure doing business with you,

 said Winceham nevertheless and the ogre replied with a nod and a vile-smelling
 burp.

Winceham bowed slightly and he showed Lernea the exit.
 As if in a trance, she slowly got up from her seat and straightened the
 bow on her back.
 They began jostling their way through the crowd.

I don't understand,

 asked Lernea sounding utterly dumbfounded.

That's how you do business on the street,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Winceham, as they calmly walked past a blunderbuss duel, right
 before both duelists' guns exploded in their faces.
 Lernea was throwing looks behind her shoulder at the ogre.
\end_layout

But, he could've told me! I would have paid it to tell me.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

He doesn't sell information.
 Not that he really could, anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Winceham commented and his face missed a flying glass mug purely by luck.
 Lernea sounded rather miffed:
\end_layout

He could've told us who does sell information!

No, that would be selling information,

 replied Winceham waving a finger.
 Lernea was right behind him, trying to make sense out of that.
\end_layout

Yeah, as a tip.
 a matter of professional courtesy.
 We did business together, so we came to know each other.
 As a tip, an added bonus if you like, he gave us a bit of information,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and picked up someone's drink from a messy, knife-ridden
 bloody table.
 Lernea was nearly oblivious to the overall controlled mayhem going on around
 them.
 She kept following Winceham blindly, trusting he really knew a way towards
 the exit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now if I understand this correctly, you're saying that he wouldn't sell
 us the information, but it was fine for him to just give it away for free?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried out Lernea as they neared the music band and the exit.
 Winceham stepped on someone lying passed out or perhaps dead on the floor.
 Lernea hopped over it at the last moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing's really free.
 We did pay him thirty pieces of coin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Winceham and downed the cup in his hand in one go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For another job entirely!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea and flung her arms wide in frustration.
 Inadvertently, someone's parrot was knocked out cold and fell in another
 man's rum-soup; the man thought the parrot was just another side dish.

Hitting himself, yes.
 But we did get our job done, didn't we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham, smiling triumphantly as they finally got outside the tavern.
 A single sign read `B-Ware'.
 Lernea shook her head and looked like she had given up on any hope of understan
ding the logic behind everything.

Ah.
 You're getting the hang of business,

 said Winceham with a grin.
 Once a breeze of cold air touched his face though, he crumbled down on
 the wooden floor of the promenade and began licking the wooden planks.

 said Lernea and forced Winceham back on his feet.

What? No, there's not enough..
 Not enough time..
 We drinks! We need to get another drink at Lemmy's!

 blabbered Winceham, looking hurt, angry and crushed at the same time.
\end_layout

There's bound to be a bath house around here somewhere,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and scanned the signs and lantern posts around them.
 Winceham looked at her with a half-asleep, out-of-focus look that he rarely
 employed.
 It was as if he was trying to ascertain whether he wasn't just imagining
 things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not a half-bad idea at all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said with a wide, lopsided grin.
 Lernea thought it was weird of Winceham to actually agree on a bath, of
 all things.

A few minutes later, she was about to realise bath houses in Tallyflop aren't
 just about bathing.
