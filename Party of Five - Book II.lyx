 series of novellas.
 That means, there's definitelt at least one more book out there that needs
 some love as well.
 Plus, it's really good to learn a bit more about the main characters and
 read their story, their first adventure together.
 Not that you really have to, me thinks, but I hope you'll like it.
 It's also good for the soul.

\begin_layout Standard

In book II, there might not be so many funny moments (the definition of
 funny is always up for debate), but I hope it delivers.
 For those of you who have already read Book I, by the time you've read
 Book II, I hope you'll be enticed to wait for Book III.
 For those of you who haven't read Book I, I hope you'll get a copy after
 reading this.
 Get one for your friends as well; like a gift or maybe part of a sinister
 plot to make their day.

I dearly hope you'll come to like the characters enough to wait for the

 God willing, when this first story arc is completed, a paperback of all

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the first part of this one, we start off in space, where the party is
 pretty much bored and nothing much of interested has happened, with the
 exception of Ned writing down lyrics and jokes, and Theo practicing magic
 with the bunny.
 When they arrive at the docks at Tallyflop, our heroes try to negotiate
 the berthing charge which is essentially a rip-off from the goblin dockmaster.
 They are not allowed to disembark, cannons and various other weapons trained
 on them.
 Dialogue ensues with the goblin until they see no wait out but to sell
 the good ship (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

) to cover the cost and be allowed to dock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Tallyflop is a majestic huge oak tree floating in space, the various branches
 acting as docks, and harbors for larger and smaller ships.
 Transportation is conducted via a complex system of pulleys, ran by the
 Central, which also covers as the administrative and technical center for
 Tallyflop, and it is run by goblins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once they sell the ship they decide to split: Ned and Winceham try to gather
 information about the elves and connect with shady characters in shady
 bars, getting hammered.
 Word gets around they've been asking questions and a doppelganger is sent
 after their trail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The sisters take it upon themselves to carry Culliper and the other pirate
 to some sort of justice.
 There is none other system than the Pit, where those that seek to be righted
 pit themselves against each other in a swashbuckling contest to the death,
 complete with taunts and the like (ala Monkey Island).
 The loser is forced to walk the plank into space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theo and the rabbit are left to care for finding a ship - with the coin
 they can afford they can find nothing except when they happen upon Reylando
 Lettifer's shipwright, a bear with a monocle, who considers him an artist
 first and an engineer, scientist and thaumaturgist second (thaumaturgy
 is what makes the engine stuff work).
 He is touched by the elves' plight and offers Theo the opportunity to take
 away a small ship that needs a bit of work, and while they work on it together,
 there is this zen side of Reylando that vibrates with theo and the Jah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Part Two, Parcifal is walking the plank after having lost from Culliper.
 The crowd is restless, and Lernea is nowhere to be seen.
 Just before Parcifal gets the literal mechanical boot that will shoot her
 into space to suffocate, Lernea rushes in overheard and picks her up.
 They evade but the crowd goes wild, trashes everything the sisters just
 keep running
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ned and Winceham are trying to recover from the hangover, when Winceham's
 paranoia turns out to be the doppleganger.
 They form a plan to lure him in with offering to sell Theo's crystal.
 While talking the neutralise him and force him to spill the beans about
 the elves and who is on their trail.
 They learn the name of the monster that had posed as Hobb, or at least
 the one with which it went by more freely at tallyflop: it's real name
 is Vrexxzloth.
 The doppelganger though wasn't the only one on their trail: A lone Arcane
 (blue tall bleak guy without humor) seeks them out and wants to sell them
 the info they need on Vrexxzloth.
 They accept ad enter a binding soul contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theo has an unexplained affinity about fixing the ship that amazes Reynaldo.
 Theo shows him the amulet and he talks about the legend of Umria and a
 planet were once the focus of the universe was balanced in.
 That crystal is part of that planet, now thought to be lost.
 Theo feels there some connection with his father.
 That's when Ned and Winceham show up and tell Theo what happened and that
 the sisters are in danger.
 With that in mind, Bo sets off hurriedly.
 When they follow him, they find out the sisters were actually lauded as
 great performers of the swashbuckling art.
 Still Culliper has wandered free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Part Three:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They need to enter Central which is right at the root of the giant oak.
 They enter through the bulk of the hollowed out tree, with reynaldo helping
 them out, his license as a shipwright and thaumaturgist on the line.
 They descend the levels to find out that the really integral part of the
 Central is restricted and is actually a small city of illithid's, creating
 magical weapons using Tallyflop as a staging and resource gathering point,
 and Central's energy, a small sun, as a manufacturing power plant.
 They stealth their way in until theo gives their position away again.
 Reynaldo fights some of the illithid guards.
 They then set a number of slaves free including the elves and then the
 others make their way to the portal controls, through traps and guards
 alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Using the arcane's instructions they reset the portal generator and the
 whole root of Tallyflop turns into a portal to the asteroid field where
 the illithid elder brain operates from.
 They board the ship and fly off into it, to book III.

\end_inset

I've never really understood all those planet-bound folk that look at the
 night sky all starry-eyed and gaze at it with a superbly idiotic grin and
 lose their grip on reality, making up all sorts of ideas about what space
 is like.
 I'll say this just once, hopefully some of you cadets are dead drunk not
 to notice the mistake you just made; space is boring, unforgiving, empty
 and a lot bigger than it looks like.
 A real lot.

\begin_layout Standard
Ned was leaning against the upper deck railing, gazing at the milky blue
 sheen of a swarm of stars that showered the ship with a fuzzy, moon-like
 glow.
 For the last few days, ever since they'd sailed into the stars, a strange
 smile seemed to occupy his face for most of his waking time.
 In his sleep, all he could see was the glitter of stars and the image of
 his father, waving at him encouragingly to move on into a beautiful unknown.
 Or perhaps take an order; Ned wasn't clear on that.
 But it did make him feel better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ship traversed the deadness of space in a suitably dead silence; one
 could only surmise it was really moving at all because of the twinkle of
 the stars as their light bounced off the metal ramrod at its prow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham, the self-proclaimed, semi-retired halfuin rogue of the party was
 snoring heavily nearby, on a simple hay bed he'd brought from below deck.
 For the most part, Wince had enjoyed their journey so far, even though
 he spent most of his time kicking in his sleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal, the feisty redhead princess regent in exile, kept a mindful, worried
 eye at how her twin sister, Lernea, queen of Nomos for a day, handled the
 ship.
 It was in fact the look of utter and total boredom that worried Parcifal;
 it seemed like it was catching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo, naturally inclined in the ways of sorcery, had just finished re-knitting
 his blond, silvery dreadlocks..
 The traditional hairdo of the woodkin elf, the dreadlock, didn't suit him,
 tall and fair-skinned as he was.
 But it was his people's heritage, even though he wasn't really one of them.
 Him and Bo, his fiery-eyed bunny companion were shooting fireworks far
 off astern.
 They looked unequivocally happy.

It's wonderful, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned to no-one in particular, and for a rather awkward amount of time,
 no-one bothered to reply.
 At length, Parcifal turned her head around and looked at him morosely,
 her hands folded behind her head as if surrendering to the uneventful,
 humdrum quagmire that she felt their journey really was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

What, exactly, is it that you find wonderful?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said in a monotone voice.
 Ned spread his arms as to hug the vastness of space surrounding them and
 replied in earnest:

Please, not another one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal wearing a worried, sickly frown; she even thrust-out her
 open palm in a begging gesture.
 Ned was puzzled; it showed in his voice and the sudden jerk of his head.

 to the north in the shape of half a box.

 pitched in Winceham with a grumby, muffled voice without warning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though half-asleep he was yet instantly aware of what was being discussed,
 his rogueish instincts always at the ready.
 Lernea's hard, solemn face, adorned in her long brown locks of hair, changed
 abruptly to that of a radiant, noble lady such as her lineage would demand
 of her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let go of the ship's helm and said, or rather announced, in a beaming
 voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Mr.
 Winceham, I think that now, as they saying goes, she's all yours.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

I wouldn't want to intrude on your persons miladies.
 I think your sister's rather tall, too young and inexperienced for me tastes,
 not to mention somewhat lank on the waist,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Winceham, with his face still buried in the soft cloth mattress
 filled with hay.
 Parcifal looked at the short halfuin with a perplexed frown, before she
 came to realise he was referring to her; her boot shortly thereafter connected
 with the halfuin's behinds, shoving him off the cot and onto the hard deck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My waist is fine by all accounts, thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal looking mildly annoyed.
 Winceham picked himself up sporting a grin of mischief and no ill feelings,
 while Ned added, riding an entirely different train of thought:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Which is to say,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 interjected Lernea, strolling around the deck stretching her back,

it's fit for animals and scum.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No-one was at the ship's helm, a matter which was soon made entirely apparent
 to everyone as the ship began to slowly list to port.
 Just as Parcifal walked over to grab the helm firmly with a look of annoyance
 on her face, she saw Bo flying accross the air as if falling slowly sideways,
 his fluffy ears shooting up in strange directions, firm and upright as
 if frozen by an amazing sense of danger.
 Theo followed close behind, smiling as broadly as a child left to its devices,
 all alone with a cookie jar.
 Parcifal stood baffled, while Theo grabbed the helm as he flew past it
 and turned the ship back on its proper course.
 He twisted his body to settle his feet on the ground with the grace of
 a dancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And..
 It seems that now, I can fly!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said proudly, while Bo could be seen a few feet away, happily munching
 on an oversized leek with awe-inspiring veracity, slowly tumbling in the
 air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned exclaimed on cue:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's space! It's so grandiose, so alluring.
 Anything is possible, see?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and pointed at the levitating bunny with a gleaming smile.
 Winceham and the Teletha sisters did not seem to share in the enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's what you've been saying for the past two weeks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and let herself slump to the cot with a weary sigh.
 Parcifal on the other hand, sounded worried.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Not to mention that all we're navigating blind, based on that scum's word
 alone.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Culliper lay in shackles in the hold; he'd told them as much as he knew
 himself.
 He had been told to raid the village and that he would collect his pay
 at Tallyflop.
 Even though Parcifal nearly convinced the rest to throw him overboard and
 use him as target practice, cooler minds had prevailed.
 Ned though very troubled about what to do with his father's killer, did
 not want to have his blood on his hands.
 He knew that wouldn't bring back his father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He'd be a fool to try and swing us.
 We'll reach some kind of port, at some point.
 That's for sure.
 Food and water is aplenty though, no worries there,

 said Winceham scratching his head and grooming his beard with a make-shift
 brush made out of some poor thing's teeth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, what if we're walking into a trap?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal, shaking her head, looking agitated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would be sailing into a trap,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 corrected Lernea from was she now considered her cot, without bothering
 to take her arm off her shut eyes.
 Theo sounded confident, seeing as he kept the ship on course with little
 effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think everything's as it should be.
 Bo isn't the least bit nervous,

 Bo seemed to wriggle with pleasure on Theo's shoulder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

Bo is a bunny, Theo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal with a voice that teetered on the brink of a shrill.
 Theo wasn't taken aback and insisted:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Harsh words in haste can oft be bad in taste,

 pouch from a vest pocket.
\end_layout

I thought Ned was the poet,

 Ned was sincere in what he thought was an apology:

Well, Svarna be my guide, there's hope for our ears yet,

 Ned was beginning to realise his talents were being judged too harshly,
 all too unfairly.

 said Parcifal and sat down on the deck, legs crossed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That's what I do, Parcifal.
 I perform,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 It was obvious in his stricken face he felt more hurt than offended.
 Parcifal drove home what sounded like a thinly-veiled insult.

Well, it would be more beneficial if you tried your hand at something else.
 A man without a sword is like a cup riddled with holes: useless.

Winceham lit his pipe, drew heavily and added as smoke left his nose and
 mouth freely:

You're being unfair, sister.
 You stood there frozen, incapacitated, just like the rest of us.
 Except Ned,

 said Lernea and from the comfort of her cot pointed a blind finger at Theo,
 missing Ned wildly.
 Parcifal unsheathed Encelados and dutifully began to check the blade in
 detail, from all angles.
 It looked sharp as ever in the starlight.

Well, there's a first time for everything, milady.
 Maybe you're too young to know better,

 A smirk full of mischief adorned his face.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It must be all that snoring,

 Lernea said matter-of-factly, and Parcifal grinned without a word.
 Her sister, she thought, had aptly filled in for her.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Ned suddenly and pointed a finger, his excitement threatening to
 tear his face apart.
 Everyone turned their heads as if silently obeying an order.
 A moment or so passed before Parcifal asked with a somewhat surreptitious,
 wary look, her hand drawn to Encelados' hilt as if on its own:

 cried Ned as he rushed to the ship's bow like a five-year old waiting for
 ice cream to manifest itself out of thin air.
 Winceham furrowed his brow and toyed with his beard for a moment before
 he couldn't help ask himself:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

That star! See how its light trembles? How it flickers, fading in and out?
 That's it! That must be Tallyflop!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Ned without taking his eyes off the trembling, pointy source of
 light.
 Bo's eyes lit up like a blowing furnace all of a sudden and he made sure
 he had Theo's full attention, jumping up and down around the ship's steering
 wheel.
 The elf knew the bunny meant business so he brought the ship's bow to bear
 dead-on where Bo had been pointing to with his whole body, much more like
 a hunting dog than an innocent-looking herbivore would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea spared a moment or so to take a look as well, barely lifting herself
 up from the cot.
 It was as if she was trying to peer over an invisible perch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

All I see is a twinkling star,

Bo sure looks excited!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal looked at the star, growing subtly larger with every passing moment.
 Then she stared at the elf and the bunny for a moment or so, her look full
 of apprehension.
 She said to Theo:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Whenever those eyes flame up..
 Nothing good ever happens.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Theo would have none of that.
 He waved a hand dismissively; with eyes fixed on the twinkling star up
 ahead, he said firmly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Preposterous.
 Utterly unfounded.
 Pessimistic superstitious misconceptions.
 Bo's eyes flaming up and our own predicaments have absolutely no correlation,

Wnceham turned and looked at Theo rather confounded.
 Yet he seemed to approve of Theo's answer, at least in principle.
 He nodded and said:

Well said, lad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham smiled at Theo, who in turn bowed lightly towards the halfuin.
 The brief moment of well-earned flattery made Parcifall roll her eyes and
 sigh.
 Winceham, always prowling about to boost his ego in many small ways that
 to him added up to enormous amounts, was about to make a sly, wry comment
 on the virtuous of proper language and etiquette.
 The grin on his face was a sure sign he was going to enjoy it no matter
 what Parcifal's reaction would be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To his surprise though, the only words that came out of his mouth when his
 gaze ventured upwards before it came down again, had nothing to do with
 proper language and much less, etiquette:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal spent a moment with her flustered face stuck in a deep frown, trying
 to fit the words she had just heard into some order that might make sense.
 Her finger was already raised as a warning when she looked at Winceham
 with a seething glare and shouted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Recant, sirrah! I know an insult when I hear one, even if I can't fathom

 cried Ned as he ran towards the bridgehead, his head stuck upwards as if
 he were training for a sword-eating contest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal only had to look upwards to see both Theo and Bo were looking up
 as well, their faces and fur respectively strangely illuminated, standing
 perfectly still like under some sort of enchanting spell.
 Her hand instictively went for Encelados' once more but half-way it froze
 as well: the sight in front of her eyes had captivated her very soul, and
 the souls of everyone else as well, it seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were sailing under a majestic field of starlight; rivulets of stardust
 and beams of light wafted down from above, where the giant gnarly branches
 of an old, wizened tree dominated the starscape.
 Where before there had been nothing but the faintest pin-prickles of light
 and a dark, solemn void, now the ship felt like it drifted onwards amidst
 a giant forest in spring, like a butterfly loitering around a blooming
 flower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their course took them gracefully soaring by clusters of huge green leaves,
 easily the size of a hamlet or small village.
 The huge leaves emanated a faint greenish glow, while in the distance all
 around them, more and more leaves and branches appeared little by little,
 like some omnipotent invisible hand was clearing up a fog-stained window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Swaths of light and soft shadows crept over them at an easy pace as the
 ship continued on its course, as if sailing under a soft, thin, silken-coloured
 bedding the likes of which every child would only ever hope to dream about.
 A tunnel of light and shadow had manifested itself on top of a playful,
 shining net that tossed and writhed about them in a beautiful dance that
 seemed to have a breath of its own.

 the whole of the ship.

By Svarna, it's the most beautiful thing I've seen.

 instantly gone, her smile beaming with a shine her armor could never match.

See? I told you Bo had a good reason for being excited.
 Isn't that right Bo?

 said Theo gleefully as he kept the ship steadily trained between a pair
 of nearly parallel branches that seemed to lead them on like a pair of
 guiding rails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then suddenly, literally out of nowhere, a ship the shape of a bumblebee
 and easily twice the size of the 
\shape italic
Mary Watchamacallit

 sporting shoddy, badly trimmed sails.
 It would have been more fair to describe it as flying collection of scrap,
 rather than a ship per se.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mere fact though that a ship like that could actually sail into space,
 suddenly made the whole endeavor of traveling through the stars acutely
 unremarkable.
 If it wasn't for a pair of large harpoons trained on the 
\shape italic
Mary Watchamacallit
\shape default

 have drawn everyone's attention with a snap.
 The oversized sharp implements of hunting and warfare were manned by unruly
 pairs of short, ugly, mischievous-looking green little things wearing ridiculou
sly extravagant goggles, oversized leather helmets and sadly, rather than
 shockingly, nothing more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's an ambush!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Parcifal and clutched Encelados defiantly with both hands, warily
 checking all around her, as if she half-expected more invisible threats
 to materialise any minute.
 The blade though, remained a shiny grey steel color; it did not give off
 its blueish glow of warning against evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It certainly looks like an ambush,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham not knowing whether he should ready his stiletto or finally
 have a try at space swimming.
 In retrospect, swimming in space did not seem like a dangerous waste of
 time in view of the harpoons.
 Theo remained silent exchanging some oddly thoughtful looks with Bo, even
 if that meant mainly staring at the rabbit's frenzied twitching nose.
 Its eyes though did not flare up; a charred mayhem seemed an ever distant
 possibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's fairly normal, I think,

 said Theo coolly, his lips forming a thoughtful pout.
 Ned a worrisome comment to make.

Which is, the gargantuan tree floating in space or being ambushed by naked

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo gave Ned a flat shrug, failing to see that an answer was not really
 expected of him.
 A deafening, snarling sound made everyone's face twitch and contort unpleasantl

 device:
\end_layout

Oy! 'Tis Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cough, a loud buzz and a shrieking noise followed in amplified fashion
 before the voice died down.
 The little green creatures wearing the goggles seemed to be enjoying this
 immensely, judging from the way they giggled and toyed around with the
 oversized harpoon launchers.
 Crude-looking contraptions as these were, they were menacingly sharp and
 shiny nonetheless.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the crew jumped off the goblin ship and floated in space, holding
 a thick rope in hand; it was a towing line.
 The little goblin was wearing nothing but a toothless grin.

 Ned asked Winceham who nodded affirmatively with a frown.
 Parcifal still held Encelados at a defensive stance, somehow waiting for
 the small, naked green goblin to transform into a towering champion of
 the goblin race.
 Reality, once more, failed to indulge her whims.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 said Winceham stroking his beard, his eyes trying to focus where the goblin's

 Lernea scratched her head and straightened her back before opening her
 eyes wide enough to let what has happening around her sink in.
 In a moment of sudden, angst-ridden clarity she exclaimed:

 As both ships moved closer to the immense trunk that still looked not very
 far yet wasn't that close, the air around them started to pick up a heady,
 peculiar smell.
 The air smelled like a mix of oil, walnuts and grog gone horribly bad.

The air inside the goblin dockmaster's office had an almost suffocating
 quality.
 The atmosphere felt thick as oil, smelling of ink and rough, cheap paper.
 Tallyflop's dockmaster's office was built inside a hollowed out section
 of the giant oak's skin.
 Its walls rose steeply into a dark, shadowy place with no ceiling in sight.
 Goblin helpers and staff could be seen running atop tiny overhead railings
 and metal grates; they passed through glass pipes, along rope bridges and
 wooden ladders.
 The almost always insidious-looking creatures appeared suddenly and disappeared
 just as quickly through small trapdoors built in the wooden walls.
 Sniggering like madmen at times, many of them carried large stacks of papers
 strapped on their back; they were all invariably naked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea's look darted around uncomfortably.
 It was as if she felt soiled by her mere presence inside that room.
 Parcifal wore a brooding expression; her hands were stuffed in her armpits.
 She was pouting like a child scorned.

\begin_layout Standard
Winceham looked intently at the stacks of papers and scrolls rising up into
 nothingness.
 He could make out the goblins above, criscrossing the room with all the
 fury of rats in a cage.
 Stroking his fine beard, the odd look on his leathery face meant he still
 couldn't make up his mind about the goblins genitalia.
 He looked committed; he just had to know.

Bo sat on Theo's shoulder idly.
 The bunny rabbit was practically asleep; the flames on his eyes were nowhere

 The goblin sitting down behind an oversized desk in front of him, had earlier

 He dived into the huge ledger in front of him again before answering; he

 With a raised brow he said flatly before returning his attention to his
 ledger, dipping a pen in some ink and adding a smudge that highly resembled
 goblin genitalia on the side of a page:

 said Ned pointing to the goblin crew outside the tiny window on their back.
 The goblin wrecking crew were hoisting down the sails.
 Lernea looked behind her shoulder and saw a large metal barrel-like construct
 on wheels, pushed on a ramp.
 It had a number of saws and hatchets attached to it and left a trail of
 smoke as it vibrated violently on the 
\shape italic
Mary Whatchamacallit's

 deck.
 The next moment, it exploded with a dumbed-down thud, senting perhaps a
 dozen goblins flying off into space.
 A rush of maniac laughter and snot-brained giggling followed suit before
 the wrecking crew went back to what appeared to be just another day's work
 for goblins.

 replied the dockmaster and barely nodded to the shackled figure of Culliper,
 his mouth gagged with a very unhygienic-looking rag.
 Culliper was propped upright, tightly pressed between Lernea and Parcifal;
 he rolled his eyes but no-one was paying any attention to him, except perhaps
 for Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned shot the pirate a hard look.
 His jaw tightened and his face became ashen gray.
 Ned's mind went back a few days; it was a very misfortunate series of events
 that had led them all the way to space and Tallyflop.
 The matter of Culliper's fate remained still a matter to settle.
 Ned felt the pressure piling up; he looked like he was about to grab the
 dockmaster by the throat when Zed cleared his throat just in time to prevent
 that.

Ned took a deep breath and cringed his face with a hand.

A loud creaking sound was then heard, followed by a couple of thuds and
 reverberating knocks.
 The floor vibrated a little, grabbing almost everyone's attention, except
 for Ned and the dockmaster; their gazes were locked in a silent, mysterious
 struggle.
 Outside, at the pier, the goblin wrecking crew had just chopped off the
 main mast and were trying to peel off it what had previously been a somewhat
 less flat, more alive, goblin.
 There wasn't much laughter involved, at least not until the moment one
 of them brandished a literally bloody spatula, much to the merriment of
 his co-workers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal exploded with a shout, condemning the lack of logic behing the

Theo was now trying to count goblin parts and limbs flying off from the

 the dockmaster's saw-like teeth failing to follow the geometry of the mouth.

 trailing some other piece of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there a problem with that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Parcifal sharply and tried to approach the goblin threateningly.
 She moved about a couple of inches before bumping onto Ned's back.
 Her sister shook her head disapprovingly and motioned her to just stay
 put.

Ned swallowed hard and nodded thoughtfully to himself before turning to

 craftmanship or the safety of the wrecking crew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

If by scrap you mean firewood, that's right,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Zed.

Firewood? Isn't that liable to catch on fire? Fire is a dangerous thing,

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo suddenly and everyone looked at him as if realising for the first
 time he might not be actually aware of his surroundings most of the time.
 On the other hand, Bo seemed quite alert and perky; yet his eyes weren't
 lit up.
 He simply wiggled his nose and scratched an ear with a hind leg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It doesn't make much sense to hack down the whole supporting structure on

 It'd be like turning a castle's foundations into a quarry,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea nodding thoughtfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still, it can't be all that valuable.
 I mean, how much firewood does a city this size need, really? It's not

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham with a shrug of his shoulders that went largely unnoticed,
 especially since he stood smack in the middle of them all, hardly able
 to breathe properly, crammed as they were.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Steam engines,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned with a sudden flash of insight.
 The goblin nodded affirmatively and tried to smile congenially; the end
 result though was less than inviting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

By steam, you mean that thing that's like smoke, except it only appears
 to be around baths and hot springs and such?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Winceham, a very uncertain expression painted on his face.
 He absent-mindedly scratched his chin, breadcrumbs falling off his beard.
 None bothered to answer him; they were rather trying to absorb the implicit
 declaration that the smell about Winceham wasn't just a matter of unfortunate
 timing, but rather a way of life.
 The minimal space inside the dockmaster's office made it all but impossible
 to ignore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, now that we've got everything sorted out, would you be bloody kind

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the dockmaster and as luck would have it, a goblin passed overhead
 riding a small unicycle on a rope and tossed an impossibly thick book on
 a huge stack that came crushing down barely a moment later, adding a little
 bit of height in a small hill behind Zed made entirely out of paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What's a steam engine?

 said Theo matter-of-factly and petted Bo behind the ears.
 The bunny seemed to concur, if one were an expert on reading whiskers.
 Theo's answer once again drew some weird looks but this time those were
 looks of surprise, coupled with the usual failure to really understand
 what he was talking about.

\begin_layout Standard

It's what makes the ships fly,

 said Ned with a face shaken by a sudden, acute realisation.
 He looked at Lernea and without uttering a word, he saw that same look
 mirrored in her face.
 She was at a loss for words for a moment.
 Zed was trying to look inconspicuous while eyeing a strangely illustrated
 centerfold page dangling from his ledger, containing fancy, dressed up
 goblins of indeterminate sex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not selling the metal bits as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Lernea with a rather off-beat tone, as if she was being merely curious.
 Ned picked her train of thought, nodded and went a step farther:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll sell you Culliper in exchange for that metal chair belowdecks.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone, except Parcifal, even Bo, looked at Ned like he had just admitted
 to being a large, furry whale dancing in a pot.
 Culliper did not even flinch; his stabbing stare was stuck on Ned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What chair?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked the goblin looking suddenly quite intrigued; he then started shuffling
 the pages in the ledger in front of him with furious speed, one eye searching
 the text on the pages and the other not daring to leave the naughty centerfold
 page out of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ned lad, that's bloody slavery,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham with a hushed, almost fearful voice.
 Lernea looked troubled, while Parcifal was smiling, either lost in thought
 or staunchly approving of Ned's decision.
 The former queen of Nomos for a day looked at Ned with a pang of worry
 and told him:

Are you sure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 said Winceham out of turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes.
 I'm sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and shot a bland look at Culliper.
 The pirate's eyes looked like small, glistening beads.
 He made no effort to so much as croak a muffled pleading voice.
 Instead, it looked as if his mouth curled up in a wicked, sly smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dockmaster traced a very curly line of goblin handwriting with one crooked
 finger and mumbled loudly:

You're selling Culliper as a slave for a grog dispenser?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Winceham asked Ned with a feeling of awed respect in his voice and Theo,
 who rarely jumped in to actually help someone else understand, helpfully
 added with a smile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The grog dispenser was the strange barrel with the lever and the tap near
 the lavatory, down below in the hold; not the one in the back with the
 odd slot.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There was a lavatory?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Winceham, sounding mildly suprised but otherwise unshaken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goblin gave the matter a small amount of thought while drool with the
 viscosity of tar started dripping off his mouth.
 He was looking at the centerfold page intently wild-eyed and frenzied when
 he suddenly cried 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Done!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and offered his hand to Ned.
 After a moment of reflexive hesitation, Ned shook it firmly; he then couldn't
 help but look at Culliper for a long, tense moment before he turned to
 leave.
 He fell on Parcifal and realised she was blocking the narrow, short exit.
 She was still lost in her own, grin-inducing thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What have you done, Ned?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Lernea while Ned slid past Parcifal who was trying to squeeze herself
 into the wrong amount of space at the wrong moment.
 Once past the exit he looked at Lernea with what must've been guilt and
 told her:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's better than the alternative.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is it? That's not justice served, Ned,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she told him with consternation, her head raised slightly above the others
 as Winceham tried to squeeze through everyone else and out of the impossibly
 small onto the promenade boardwalk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I needed to do something about it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and shrugged slightly.
 Lernea bit her lip and shot a look at Culliper who was already being whisked
 away using a harness and a pulley, ever higher and higher by goblins hidden
 from sight.
 His ice-cold gaze sparkled away into the darkness; Culliper and Ned locked
 eyes.
 A moment of gritty tension passed like glue becoming undone; Ned felt like
 he had already made a terrible, unavoidable mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later, Winceham asked Ned even as the others left the crowded office
 with more ease:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Where are we going to find a new ship? What's so important about that chair

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Maybe Theo can answer that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Ned and Bo's eyes suddenly lit up, even as Theo bumped his head
 on the doorway and silently nursed his head with a thoughtful yet promising
 look, as if something new and wonderful had just happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His fingers went for the crystal around his neck.
 The shimmer on its surface as light fell from all the thousands of lamps

 She asked without really looking all too worried, or indeed caring:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 said Parcifal and walked along the promenade that slowly turned below them
 like a corkscrew, leading to a brilliantly lit, brightly coloured neighborhood

 of fuel quality grog and an indistinct aroma of badly charred meat.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and Theo, who had been feeding Bo a thick stick of limegrass from

It might be, it might be.

 He shook his head approvingly and said:

Ned and Lernea exchanged knowing, troubled looks and sprang to a running
 pace, while Bo jumped off Theo's lap, flames brilliantly wild in his eyes.
 The bunny easily outran them both in a few heartbeats.
 Theo then realised that something important was happening and decided he
 just might as well fly towards the glow instead of hopping along so inefficient
ly.
 He leapt off the promenade and into the vaccuum with the practiced ease
 of someone putting on his slippers.

Phew! What a putrid smell!

 said Winceham, attracting aggravated looks from Ned even in the thick of
 battle.
 The halfuin was ready to make a wry comment when his senses alerted him
 to a new threat.
 He stepped on the ledge of the promenade and vaulted himself into the air
 with a backflip; the next moment he landed on the wooden floor, his tiny
 yet lethal blade stuck in the neck of an orc.
 Vile green blood gushed in spurts as the orc toppled and fell off the promenade
 and onto the void of space, without so much as a gurgling sound.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 shouted Ned and reloaded his crossbow with a new bolt.
 He took aim at two orcs who were rushing the sisters with a pair of raised
 bucklers.
 Ned took his time before he let fly a shot; it missed wildly at the last
 moment.
 The orcs drew their weapons, a murky blood-spat axe and a rough whaler's
 spear.
 Ned was already reloading.

Parcifal was locked in a swordfight with the orc that was, in all probability,
 the gang's leader.
 It was a tall, brutish orc with a lisp; he wore real mail and the nasty
 ability to dodge and parry like the devil's barbed tail.
 Lernea heard the halfuin's warning just in time; she quickly loaded her
 bow with two arrows and knelt cooly.
 The crowd applauded at the apparently rare exhibit of teamwork the party
 was providing; most of the boardwalk was filled with people wanting to
 take a peek at the unscheduled fight.

 cried the tall orc, as he parried yet another blow from Parcifal aimed
 squarely at the small gap at his neck, between his helmet and his armor.
 Lernea held her breath and let the arrows fly even as the orcs were ready
 to leap onto her; the next instant, their weapons were flying harmlessly
 in the air, all the rush of their wielders diminished with a sudden flop.
 The two orcs were lying slumped against the floor, an arrow having pierced
 their skulls clean through.

 and managed to tackle Parcifal with a sweep of his leg, dropping her on
 the ground.
 All of a sudden, there was a blinding flash of light; thick smoke covered
 everything as far as anyone from the party could see.
 A mistimed flurry of missiles was absorbed into the cloud harmlessly.

 The cheery tone of his voice was starkly contrasted by a lot of muttering

Parcifal stood back on her feet, panting from the exertion.
 Encelados had never left her grasp; the blade was silver gray again, yet
 stained with dried orcish blood, the colour of weathered copper.

\begin_layout Standard
The promenade slowly returned to its more usual hubbub; the traders at the
 stalls picked up from they had left and started shouting their offers of
 smelly sea-urchins-on-a-stick, while groups of sailors were busy smashing
 cups of grog against each other's head again.
 A few of the intelligentsia even applauded the party as the smoke eventually
 cleared and cheered them on for an entertaining, well-performed fight.
 A couple even tossed some coin at Ned and Winceham's feet.

 asked Lernea as she was rounding up her arrows from all the orc bodies
 she had felled.
 Ned wasn't sure about the crowd's reaction; he looked up, around the trees'
 giant leaves and branches where other boardwalks snaked their way.
 Up there, all around, small gangs of crowds amassed as well, gazing from
 shady balconies and lit terraces alike.
 By the looks of it, deadly combat counted as entertainment for these people.
 It was a troubling idea that the halfuin was quick to analyze more fully.

\begin_layout Standard

Nah, they're just being appreciative.

 The jokes helped as well,

Lernea walked over to Ned's side.
 Parcifal asked with a feeling of uncertainty:

\begin_layout Standard

 replied Lernea.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Would you mind your step please, missus?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said a tall, lank fellow with a bland, ghostly pale face who seemed to
 have appeared out of nowhere.
 An almost identical man beside him was pulling a rather large handcart.
 They were dressed in simple, loose-fitting violet-colored robes and matching
 sandals.
 The two men began to load one of the bodies onto the cart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What are you doing?

 asked Lernea as if someone had just spilled milk and cookies on her palace's

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just clearing up the promenade.
 If you don't mind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came an answer without any sort of color in the voice, except perhaps bland
 indifference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly, an arrow zipped through the air and got stuck on the pale-faced
 man's back.
 He slightly furrowed his brow, smiled hesitantly, and fell dead right on
 top of the body he was carrying.
 Lernea took a step back reflexively and saw there was a note attached to
 the arrow.
 The other man in the robe observed a moment's silence and nodded to himself
 pensively.

Mack always said he wanted to go out on the job.
 You know, doing something notable,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 bodies without another word.
 Lernea overcame her shocked surprise and read the note.
 Her face became an oblique mask of harsh determination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The grog dispenser, yes,

 Lernea pondered at the note for a moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 she said and her face turned thoughtful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are `they'?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Parcifal, wiping off the rest of the orcish blood from Encelados
 with one sudden sweep of the blade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The Culprits,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's signed, `The Culprits'! With a capital `C'!

 Winceham was lying down on the promenade totally relaxed, even when the
 body collector started washing away the thick, green sticky pools of blood
 lying about.

 asked Lernea.
 Ned shrugged and paused for a moment.
 At length, he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe he's lost.
 Maybe he was scared, I don't know.
 Maybe he's just fooling around, who can tell? It's Theo.

Affinity,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How do we go about that? We just got jumped in plain view.
 Was it those Culprits' doing? The place seems to be full of gangs like

I think I know the right man for the job.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Lernea said and shot a gaze full of meaning at Winceham, followed by a
 grin.
 The halfuin noticed, exhaled a puff of smoke and said with utmost sincerity
 and a misguided sense of manliness:
\end_layout

Theo opened his eyes and couldn't see a thing.
 He blinked a couple of times until his eyes adjusted to the nearly total
 lack of light.
 Still, he saw nothing more than a faint orange glow caressing a crude opening
 somewhere to his right.
 He surmised he was in a large room of some kind.
 The atmosphere was warm and pleasant, with an earthly feeling about it.
 Theo felt his hands itch; he then heard the sound of rustling leaves as
 he propped himself up, resting on his hands.
 He was lying on a bed of leaves.
 Oak leaves, judging by their fuzziness factor.
 Theo only knew this wasn't where he was supposed to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then remembered falling off the promenade, trying to swim in space after
 flying had somehow failed him.
 And then he remembered the piers off the huge branches, all kinds of ships
 in their berths; lights on the promenades and the ledges of the giant tree.
 Everything had seemed to go by at a steady, easy speed.
 Perhaps it was him falling downwards, he wondered briefly; he never was
 good with the technicalities of events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got up and blindly staggered forward, his hands splayed with open palms.
 He was hoping to find a wall or a lamp, anything that could illuminate
 his whereabouts in any helpful way, literally or not.
 His eyes tried to pierce the darkness, without much success.
 It wasn't the usual sort of darkness his elven eyes could at least help
 him navigate without tripping and landing on something unhealthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the first few steps, the sound of leaves under his feet became a mute,
 silent caress.
 Theo was stepping on fuzzy, soft grass.
 His outstretched hands then bumped onto something soft and furry.
 The unknown surface was warm and inviting to the touch; it felt strange
 to Theo, yet somehow familiar.
 He seeked its outline with both hands; the soft fuzziness stretched onto
 a wide arc before it dipped downwards and then upwards again, like some
 sort of peculiar mass of rolling hills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I gather you're awake,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said a deep, rumbling voice with a hint of annoyance, followed by a low-keyed
 snarl.
 No answer came from Theo; he was hard at thought about how to answer.
 It wasn't a question per se, but it did make him think about whether or
 not he was genuinely awake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not sure.
 How can I tell if this isn't a dream?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo in absolute seriousness, his hands groping the soft furriness
 in front of him reflexively.
 He then felt a slap across his face that left him speechless and his hands
 frozen stiff, now groping nothing but air.
 There was a loud clap-like sound like wood meeting stone and then light
 suddenly poured from numerous points that seemed set in a circle around
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As light filled the emptiness it quickly defined a large enclosed space,
 the natural walls nothing more than huge root outgrowths.
 Theo realised he was in an indoor grove of sorts; the dirt floor was covered
 in grass.
 There flowers, various small trees and little gardens; water and naked
 roots abounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most inescapable reality though was that the voice seemed to belong
 to a nine-foot tall bear wearing a bright, orange toga down to its waist,
 decorated with blood-red shapes and some sort of writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo glanced at his splayed hands and realised his shoulders were the same
 height as the bear's behinds.
 The bear, as if on cue, turned around and lowered its head.
 Theo hoped that perhaps by some sort of small mercy and an inordinate amount
 of luck the bear would be deaf, dumb and blind.
 It wasn't so; the beer stooped low and seeked eye contact with Theo.
 Its eyes were the colour of honey and its rotund, white-grey face nearly
 filled Theo's view in an imposing manner.
 The elf raised his eyes almost involuntarily; their gazes locked.
 There was a stern, crystal-clear shine about the bear's eyes, like a pair
 of tiny, spotless, golden mirror beads.
 The bear stood there for a moment before it made a statement with an elevated
 sense of importance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Where is that path?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo, his eyes darting all around the floor and then the walls, literally
 searching for some kind of path or trail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Within,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the bear and bowed with reverence, its great paws pointing to its
 huge chest, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and without,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it added stretching its hands.
 Theo looked nothing less than confused.
 He barely managed a word purely out of trying to appear polite, especially
 since he had - however inadvertently - grabbed the bear's behinds not a
 minute earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ah.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear motioned with one paw for Theo to lay himself on the ground as
 it did so as well.
 Theo looked a bit undecided, but nevertheless sat down on a patch of grass
 right beside a short, delicate-looking tree.
 Water ran under it in a small stream not wider than a man's palm.
 The bear sat itself down near the old, mossy bark of the wooden walls.
 A few feet separated the two of them.
 When the bear spoke, its voice reverberated serenely across the picturesque
 grove.

\begin_layout Standard
Theo searched his robe's pockets and felt embarassed to find nothing but
 a piece of lint.
 He then realized the crystal was still lodged inside that strange chair.
 That also brought to mind Bo; the bunny was nowhere around.
 Theo suddenly felt a chill rise up his spine and a terrible feeling of
 loneliness overcame him.
 The bear saw Theo was looking nervous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 asked the bear gently.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there a wrong answer?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 countered Theo with some alarm in his voice.
 A wide, homely smile formed on the bear's mouth.
 It seemed to be surprisingly happy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Indeed.
 There is no wrong answer; there is no right question.

Then I guess a drink wouldn't hurt.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear nodded and flexed its torso around in an astounding show of agility.
 It reached for a couple of bear-sized wooden cups perched on a natural
 shelf along the walls.
 He offered one cup to Theo who held it in both hands much more like he
 would a jar or a vase.
 The bear put its own cup down on the ground and made a gesture with both
 its front legs that it used readily like arms.
 It matched both its paws, flexing the edges preternaturally, forming some
 kind of winged shape, and closed its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A loud hum then reverberated outwards from the bear's chest in a rhythmic
 pattern.
 The humming stopped abruptly a few moments later, just as it was beginning
 to become too loud for comfort.
 Theo was about to ask for a cup the size he could handle, when suddenly
 a swarm of lights filled the grove.
 They whirled around them with a benign, almost melodic buzz.
 The swarm looked like tiny sparkles of glittering raindrops fluttering
 in the air; it suddenly split in two, and each part dived away like a single
 mass in each cup, spinning wildly inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next moment, their shininess was no more; all that remained was little
 ember specks wafting in the air, vanishing as swiftly as they had appeared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bear raised its cup and bowed imperceptibly.
 It then opened its eyes and cocked its head in a manner which implied it
 was having a spiffy time indeed.
 That, or it was right about ready to rip the living flesh out of Theo in
 one bite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My name is Tejwel Al-Dub.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and drank the cup in one go.
 Theo looked at his own cup and saw a wonderful, golden-hued liquid sloshing
 easily about the cup, starry like a summertime's sea.
 Theo took a careful, measured sip.
 His mouth felt like an ocean tide ridden with flowers; his stomach was
 instantly placated and felt full.
 His heart felt warm and his mind was put at ease.
 It felt like drinking the stuff of dreams.

The loud, corny music stopped every time something or someone was flung

 with every round of drinks that was announced to be on the house.

She laid herself back on the rather uncomfortable chair and tried to smile

 asked the ogre through its cave of a mouth, its teeth a purely decorative
 add-on, long ago lost and never found.
 The ogre was the fat, grey-green sort; a typical example of its kind.
 Its rotund belly was a good indicator that actually chewing one's food
 was not a prerequisite for most ogres.
 Especially those that were usually employed as muscle in the various nefarious
 trading agreements that took place all too commonly in Tallyflop.

She's asking, as far as I can recall, if you've ever seen a flying bunny

 Or a bunch of dark-skinned hoots wearing strips of leather instead of normal
 clothes.
 Something along those lines,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 explained Winceham and filled his mouth with what was left of his drink.
 After making a show of sloshing the house special, the last bottle of Mythriam'

 was, without throwing up.

Winceham seemed to feel a bit queasy for a moment before he fell off his

 she asked with her eyebrow furrowed in a way that implied a conniving,
 insidious sort of discussion was taking place, while in fact it was more
 of a conniving, insidious monologue.
 The ogre was busy scratching a layer of crust made out of some sort of
 fungi on its belly; it completely missed the delicately contrived facial
 expression on Lernea's face.

Lernea sighed.
 She was a staunch believer in diplomacy, but it looked like they were wasting

 She was about to grab Winceham from his accessory belt and drag him away

It then indeed proceeded to hit himself in the head with its powerful fists;
 the ogre's eyes went rolling for a while and its head swerved this way
 and that, the eyeballs trying to remain in their sockets.
 He raised a blotched hand in front of his face; he had two fingers raised.
 He then hit itself in the head once more.
 The ogre was nearly passed out but it stood its ground on its chair, which
 comprised of a big rock; imported furniture, the good stuff.
 At length, after it could focus its eyes once more, it spoke once more.
 There was a recognizable amount of hurt in its voice:

Winceham nodded to Lernea with a smile and offered his hand to the ogre.
 The gesture went unnoticed, as the ogre was now eating some of the pinkish

\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's been less than pleasurable doing business with you,

Winceham bowed slightly and he showed Lernea the exit.
 As if in a trance, she slowly got up from her seat and straightened the
 bow strung on her back.
 They began jostling their way through the mostly drunken, massive crowd
 that consisted entirely of sailors and their associated ilk, with the exception
 of a group of space-turtlemen who looked a lot like empty shells after
 all the time they'd been trying to get a drink.

 ogre.

 Lernea was still throwing looks behind her shoulder at the ogre.

 Lernea didn't even notice, but she did sound rather miffed.

 Lernea was right behind him, trying to make sense out of that when a heavily

 suspended from a chandelier on fire, shouting insults at someone named
 Bobby.

Yeah, he did, but that was a tip.
 A matter of professional courtesy.
 We did business together so as a tip, an added bonus if you like, he gave
 us a bit of information.
 He did us a favor,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Winceham and picked up someone else's drink from a messy, knife-ridden
 bloody table were noone seemed to be breathing.
 Lernea kept following Winceham blindly, trusting he really knew a way towards
 the exit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Now if I understand this correctly, you're saying that he wouldn't sell

 cried out Lernea as they neared the music band and the exit of the nameless
 bar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Nothing's really free.
 We did pay him thirty pieces of coin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Forty pieces! And that was for an entirely different job!

 cried Lernea and flung her arms wide in frustration.

 said Winceham, smiling triumphantly as they finally walked outside the
 tavern, anointed in a cloud of smoke, gunpowder and grog fumes.
 A single sign outside the otherwise unassuming establishment read `B-Warez'.
 Lernea shook her head and shrugged looking suddenly powerless.
 She had given up on any hope of understanding the logic behind what had

Parcifal straightened her hair, adjusted her armor's bindings and straps

 In the natural alley that formed behind her between two immense branches

 They were all beaten up, nursing a bloodied nose, a couple of broken fingers

 Their teeth had been invariably lessened in number; their flimsy-looking

 In very few moments, Ned had lost her from sight.
 One thing he had head out on the streets of Tallyflop seemed certain to

 Ned somehow didn't really worry that Parcifal would really go missing;

Whatever her issues, they would have to wait, Ned thought to himself.
 In his heart, Theo and Bo took precedence, even though it was Theo's woodking

 But there was no talk of them either.
 Perhaps Culliper had managed to fool them.

Ned's mind raced: the throne from the ship and Theo's crystal were perhaps
 a lot more important than any of them had thought.
 The fact that these people who called themselves Culprits had snatched

 Their note said they'd return Bo once they were done, and that did nothing

Does he now? Well, he did stop for a drink on the way,

 she said, trying to make it sound as if it was really just one drink, while
 in fact multiple drinks were being implied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's just great.
 Your sister ran off just a minute ago.
 I don't think she's gone missing like Theo though; she just needed her
 head cleaned up.
 For all I know, she just might drink her mind off it with Wince,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned gloomily and shrugged.
 He went on as the magnificent beasts of the Trading Circus rode past them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's probably just as well.
 We didn't get anything useful; just a few street thugs with broken arms,
 bruised bodies and rotten egos.
 What about you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, looking at Lernea with a hopeful smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing at all.
 Everyone is so tight-lipped.
 You didn't get anything? Anything about the Culprits? Anything about Theo?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded anxious all of a sudden.
 Her eyes searched Ned's face thoroughly, inquisitively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Zilch.
 Parcifal was rather efficient at making people run on sight.
 Still, what low-lifes we could get our hands on seemed like they really
 knew nothing about the Culprits.
 In fact, most of them didn't seem to even understand the word,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see.
 Well, in that case, I think I need a word alone with you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea, her voice tuned down a notch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Alone? We're pretty much alone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and waved at the indifferent crowds of people that surrounded
 them.

There's something terrible going on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Go on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and nodded with arms crossed over his chest, his eyes locked onto
 Lernea's worried face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's Parcifal.
 She's really not being herself lately.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, you certainly know her better than I do, but if I were to make an
 educated guess, I think she's just being jealous of you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea sounded surprised and oddly excited at the same time.
 She touched Ned's arm with a sense of purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, why should she be?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't know, I'm not sure.
 I must've said something about you that ticked her off.
 But I'm not sure what or why for that matter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and his gaze came to stand at Lernea's hand.
 She was practically leaning against him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, that's just like my sister now.
 Ever since she was a toddler.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and felt her warm breath inching closer to his face.
\end_layout

Since she was little.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're only a minute apart,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned with a baffled look.
 His eyes fell randomly at Lernea's chest, but it didn't appear to be so
 random.
 She saw that and twisted her gaze away from him suddenly in a dramatic
 fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Still though, she's the little one.
 But enough about her.
 I think I might have a lead about the elves.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You just said you found nothing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned feeling perplexed.
 Something bothered him, but he couldn't pin it down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But there is a lead! And we need to follow it!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with urgency, both her hands gripping Ned's arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright.
 We need to pick up Winceham first.
 It'll be easy to spot him; he might be small but he can make a lot of noise.
 Especially when he's had his version of a couple of drinks.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned made to turn and leave towards the direction Lernea came from.
 She grabbed him by one arm; there was a tone of instant anger in her objection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's no time for that.
 After all, he'll need to get sobered up before he can be of any use.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well then let's find Parcifal.
 She's bound to be somewhere near,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned and started off toward the main boardwalk where Parcifal had lost
 herself.
 Lernea would simply not have it; there was an edge to her voice that had
 never been there before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not listening; there's no time.
 Our lead is leaving on a ship!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A ship? What's the plan then? Jump him in the docks?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned incredulously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 Just follow me.
 I know a short cut.
 We can catch him on his way there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Lernea and went right into the same alley where Parcifal had dispensed
 her sort of justice to the poor thugs of Tallyflop's trade district.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? Just the two of us? Is he alone? What sort of lead? Can't we just
 talk about this first?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned while Lernea was already making her way to the shadowy cleft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Through that alley?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned once more, pointing a hesitant finger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea insisted with a broken voice, and an alien, ice cold gaze.
 Ned shrugged warily and followed her from a distance.
 He saw her bow strung across her back clearly and noticed something odd:
 she had her bow on the opposite way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Something wrong with your bow?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why do you ask that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea said with a shallow voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm just saying.
 It looks like you have it on wrong.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, I'm just trying out if it works better this way,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and kept walking towards the shadowy alley.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About last night..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned and let his voice trail off.
 Lernea came to a stop and turned around to face him slowly.
 There was a strange grin on her face.
 Her voice was little more than a whisper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about last night?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't you remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ned with a frown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course I do! But now is not the time to reminisce!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't it? I thought it was a special night.
 I thought you loved me!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a voice full of hurt.
 His hands went to his waist, near his crossbow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea looked at his blurry eyes intently.
 Her face warmed up, her eyes shone with sweetness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Of course I do! We can get together again later, but right now we must --
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he knew.
 Ned suspected it, he had felt it in his gut, but it was at that moment
 that he knew whoever that was, it wasn't Lernea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Even odds suck, don't they? Just who the hell are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impostor changed his body stance.
 She now stood defiant, a mad grin on her face.
 She cocked her head sideways and looked at Ned with a crazy, wide-eyed
 look.
 Her eyeballs turned pitch black in the blink of an eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm just a messenger.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Really? What's the message?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ned, the crossbow now firmly in his hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hobb sends his greetings!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and backflipped into the shadows of the alley with blinding speed,
 in a cat-like fashion.
 Ned let fly the loaded bolt but he was more than just a heartbeat too slow.
 The bolt failed to hit; what was more alarming, it was as if the shadow
 had eaten the fake Lernea alive.
 Not an edge of her shape was to be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned put away the crossbow and took up his machete; a gift from Theo.
 Again, he was too slow; a tentacle reached out from the shadows and twisted
 itself around his arm.
 It reeled him in with such force that he flew in the air, his arm nearly
 pulled out of his socket.
 He saw the flash of cold steel and the glint of four evil, frosty blue
 eyes.
 He tried to flex his body out of harm's way but he knew that metal flash
 was meant for him; he knew those eyes.
 He'd seen those kind of eyes before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another flash of metal nearly blinded him; he felt something cold cover
 his face in spurts.
 His arm was free and he was laying on the ground, half-covered inside the
 shadow.
 He tried to stand up, the machete still firmly in his hand.
 He saw another tentacle shoot out from the darkness, but it wasn't meant
 for him.
 It was aiming for someone wearing dark, tight robes and wielding two short
 blades that seemed too thin to be real.
 A hood kept the stranger's face hidden from view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned saw the tentacle cleanly cut away, squirming and spurting a thick murky
 liquid, like milk of some kind; it was the same liquid that was dripping
 down his chin.
 The robed figure then let his blades fly blindly inside the supernatural
 shadow; instead of crashing against the alley's bark-skinned wall, two
 huge spurts of that same white liquid shot in the air.
 A hollow, otherworldly shriek was heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea's impostor then shot out from the shadow with unnatural alacrity,
 cartwheeling past the robed figure faster than before.
 She was trying to escape; Ned was on his feet and running after her.
 A few heartbeats later she slumped on the wooden plank floor of the promenade
 like someone invisible had tackled her.
 Three star-like pieces of metal were stuck on her spine.
 A shiny metallic sort of liquid oozed from her lethal wounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned stood there for a moment, unsure of what had just happened.
 He gathered his wits about him and turned around with the machete in his
 good hand, as ready as he could be.
 The distinctly calm voice of a woman sought to allay his fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're safe, at least for now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the woman said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The robed figure drew its blades from the shadow and waved violently them
 in the air; white droplets of blood sprinkled the promenade's floorboards.
 The rest trickled down the flawless blades with ease.
 Ned realised his heart was beating fast; his hair was standing up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down.
 We need to find the rest of your party; they could be in danger as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are you? What were those things?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm an ally.
 Those things were a doppelganger and his assasin pet, a Sidian starfish.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned looked at the fake Lernea's dead body and shook his head in disbelief.
 There were so many things that begged explanation, but it felt like they
 had to wait.
 He looked at the woman in robes but was almost too afraid to ask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know you didn't want me killed, that's for sure.
 I probably owe you my life.
 That kind of an ally shows her face.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the robed woman and with a sudden burst of speed, she sprang right
 next to Ned and hugged him tight as a baby.
 Ned's response was to freeze in surprise.
 So close to him, he saw her cheeks under the limelight and knew she was
 grinning.
 Barely a breath later they were climbing up the giant oak's bark, pulled
 up in the air by a shiny silvery line, thinner than a strand of hair.
 Ned would have loved to sound more courteous, but the extraneous circumstances
 didn't allow for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just who the hell are you lady?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he shouted through the rush of the night air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just call me Judith,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said huskily as they rose higher and higher.
 Below them, at the spot of the pretty uneven fight, a cart pulled over
 and a tall, lank man began loading the bodies.
 He had some trouble when he came upon the one with the tentacles.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mack did the smart thing; this job's getting weirder and weirder all the

Now try again, Hanul,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej from across the small grove.
 Theo nodded mostly to himself, took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
 He began to concentrate.
 His face at first appeared to be calm, yet there were stern, sharp shadows
 lining it within a few moments.
 A vein on his head began to throb; then another down his neck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo started trembling visibly; his whole body shook with mounting tremors.
 His face became flush-red, his breathing had practically stopped; he gave
 the impression he was about to explode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Theo with a feeling of immense relief, panting thoroughly, yet breathing
 once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tej wasn't looking at him.
 He was checking up on some of his bee hives, built on corners and crevices
 all over the old hollowed-out root system that had been turned into a network
 of corridors, hallways and storage space for what Tejwel called his 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Grotto of Solitude
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Believing is everything, Hanul.
 Try again,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the bear and licked a paw dripping with glowing honey.
 Small droplets flew in the air and fell away from Tej and Theo, flying
 not towards the ground but all along the length of a corridor that led
 to the void of space.
 Theo sighed, breathed deeply once more and concentrated again, this time
 with steely-eyed determination.
 Tej paused and shot a wary look around him; he had noticed the breeze was
 blowing in the wrong way.
 In truth, there was no wrong or right way down there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things worked in a very peculiar manner so very near the root of the giant
 oak, which Tej referred to as the Khidr.
 Water would sometimes freeze without it being cold.
 At other times, the heat would turn the small reclusive garden into a steamy
 jungle and at times everything would float in the air, especially the glowbees.
 They formed a cloud of light as they helplessly tried to find which way
 was up and which was down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just can't Tejwel,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo panting with bulging eyes, tears welling up in his eyes from
 the strain of his last effort.
 No matter how much he tried, the heavy barrel of clay filled with glowhoney
 hadn't budged an inch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe I'm wrong,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej and licked another honey-laden finger with delight, his enormous
 face squirming reflexively.
 Theo was sitting on the grassy floor, his legs crossed in what felt like
 a knot at first.
 Exactly in front of him sat a huge, immovable barrel made of clay, filled
 with last year's glowhoney.
 Theo looked morose at best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe.
 I hope you're not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and Tej replied as if he hadn't been paying attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But I think something is holding you back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the bear and stood in front of the beehive, breathing heavily.
 Theo opened his eyes and saw Tej was very preoccupied with tending to a
 very particular beehive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What could that be?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo without expecting for an answer that could be immediately understood.
 A few hours of meditation and friendly talk that made little or no sense
 had proved that Theo had some sort of natural aptitude in what Tej called
 Rho.
 At least, that's what Tej thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A barrier!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the giant bear with dramatic tension in his voice, only to finally
 give in and have a go at the bee hive with both paws, his massive teeth
 tearing it apart, consuming the glowhoney and the wax without a care.
 Swarms of bees escaped into neighboring hives, honey splattered the walls
 and whole hexagonal chunks of wax fell like debris towards space.
 Theo couldn't stop staring; it was as if something base had suddenly possessed
 the usually benevolent and kind ursine creature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pray you find another home, friends,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej and burped loudly.
 He then sent the small cloud of glowbees hovering about him away with a
 wave of his paw.
 He turned around and slowly walked towards Theo with his eyes closed; a
 perfect serenity covered his face.
 He sat down on the grassy floor next to Theo and sighed.
 A couple of minutes passed with nothing but the humming of the ever-present
 glowbees in the background to fill the silence.
 Tej simply sat there, breathing heavily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is something wrong?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Theo.
 He allowed for a few moments; Tej usually took his time to provide what
 was supposed to be an answer, but Tej made no sound other than a thin,
 low, rumble.
 Theo leaned closer to the large mammal; the rumbling sound was coming from
 Tej's stomach.
 On closer inspection, better yet, it seemed like the great bear was snoring
 heavily, soundly asleep like a disropoptionately sized baby.
 Theo didn't know what to make of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sleeping?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he got up and asked right into Tej's ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was one hive! Just one!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried out the bear in anguish, shaking as if the nightmares stalked him
 in his wake still.
 Theo felt he should allay Tej's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's fine, Tejwel.
 I myself would've been tempted to eat a whole glowhoney-laden beehive if
 I were your size.
 It certainly would appeal to me since it seems to be so easy.
 And sweet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and nodded.
 Tejwel blinked fast only twice and realised he was awake once more.
 He felt his belly with both hands and looked at it as if something troubling
 was going to spew forth.
 At length he spoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is my weakness, my burden alone to carry.
 I sometimes lose control, I must confess.
 It is one of the reasons I still seek the end to my path.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think a little nap isn't that bad.
 It can be good for you, they say.
 I myself don't sleep much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo sounding like a confused, mentally challenged person.
 Tejwel smiled keenly and looked at the rushing stream of water while he
 talked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I meant the honey, dear Hanul.
 Once upon a time, I would've done anything for honey.
 Now, it is thankfully a rare thing.
 But still, when my spirit is troubled, I have this almost unquenchable
 thirst: a strange, powerful urge overpowers me.
 I lose myself in a sweet madness,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej, his huge paw covering half of Theo's backside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And the sleep? Is it fretful because of the guilt?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 That's because I overeat.
 We shall speak of this another time.
 I have an inkling about why my spirit is so troubled; it must be the same
 reason you do not seem able to ride the Rho,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej thoughtfully, his deep voice rumbling more than ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

About that Rho, it couldn't by any chance be plain old magic? I'm supposed
 to be pretty good at magic, if not awesome by some accounts,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo with a thin grin.
 Tejwel's breath felt warm on Theo's face; it was followed by an austere,
 disapproving voice that hinted at violence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pride is death!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Tej and demanded Theo's undivided attention before he went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pride is a sin sweet as many but deadlier than most.
 Heed my words Hanul, for I have walked the prideful path and it is barbed
 and full of honey.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Everyone loves honey though,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo sounding genuinely disappointed.

Exactly!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But what does that mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Theo fearing the discussion would soon dissolve into one of Tej's
 cryptic monologues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You tell me, Hanul.

 said Tej calmly and extended his paws.
 Theo sounded a little unsure, a bit worried and rather disappointed.

That doesn't sound right Tej.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

My paws.
 Touch my paws and free your mind friend.

\begin_layout Standard

I can do that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo in a relaxed fashion and did so.

Now breathe.

I am breathing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Breathe slowly.
 As if air is nothing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tej and lifted his head as if gasping to breathe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inquired Theo with a troubled brow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Listen, Hanul.
 Listen to the wind blowing through this grove.
 Listen to the flutter of the winged bees.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Theo did listen, or at least tried to.
 Tej's voice was becoming more shallow with every breath of his.

Space.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

What else?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Not much.
 We were travelling in space for two weeks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo, nodding reassuredly to himself.
\end_layout

Go back before that.

I have some new friends with me.

No.

 said Tej, his voice beginning to sound forceful, demanding.
\end_layout

No,

Go back, before meeting Bo.
 What do you see?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Before Bo? I can't remember anything before Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Theo, his voice wavering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Don't think, Hanul.
 Go back.
 Breathe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tej urged him.

I don't remember.
 It was Bo, and me, and -

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 there was urgency and purpose in the bear's gravely voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Father.
 I remember someone I called

And Bo?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He's not there.
 There's another boy my age, more or less.
 But Bo's not there,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo agitated, nervous, as if someone had him on the run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look deeper.
 Stop breathing,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej with a commanding voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo perplexed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Stop breathing and listen to your mind's eye!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej with immense authority, his voice not unkind yet terrible to hear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That doesn't make any sense!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Listen! See! Feel! Don't breathe!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried the bear, and Theo felt compelled to do all that.
 There was no other way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The boy's long haired.
 I can only see his back.
 He's crying, I think.
 And..
 Blazes! It's Bo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The realization struck Theo like a bolt in the chest.
 He wasn't sure if he felt like crying out of happiness or sorrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tej urged him for more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's turned into a rabbit! We're brothers! Me and Bo, we're brothers!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what of the father?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For the father, nothing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sudden, powerful vibration shook the grotto.
 It was as if the whole of Tallyflop shook along with it and changed direction;
 like a moment in time had been undone; like a huge clock had been set back
 only for the barest of moments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, you know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tej with finality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

I never thought, I..
 I hadn't imagined..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now empty that barrel of honey,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej and pointed the huge barrel of honey standing in the middle of
 the grove like an unwanted guest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? I don't think now is the time.
 I need to find the others.
 I need to find Bo,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and got up, started to pace around the grove.
 Behind him, the whole mass of glowhoney rose up from the barrel and dispersed
 itself into hundreds of different little streams, each finding its own
 path through Tej's small maze and into an empty jar or vase to fill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The honey is where it's supposed to be, Hanul,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej smiling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo almost terrified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

You ask the wrong questions out of fear.
 Fear not.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo.
 It was those sort of comments from Tej that he couldn't help but try to
 understand however improbable it seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Exactly!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't understand.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tej nodded appreciatively and his whole body shook along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yet, you are more enlightened than ever.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Tej, I need to find my friends.
 I need to find my brother.
 Even though he is just a rabbit now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A friend in need, is a friend indeed.
 Finding your friends should not be hard.
 Follow me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej and with implausible swiftness got off the grassy ground and set
 off towards one of many corridors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

More tests?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Theo as he followed closely behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This wasn't a test, Hanul.
 This was your rebirth,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej with a measure of triumph.
 Theo sounded a bit skeptical about rebirths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But it's still me.
 Isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is.
 Now we'll take the Elevator,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 announced Tej and led Theo into someplace even deeper than he had thought
 possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What elevator?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Capital `E'.
 There's just the one Elevator in Khidr,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tej raising a paw and led Theo through twisting and turning parts
 of the giant oak, a blemish of light from glowbees guiding them downwards.

 said one of the two men standing watch over Bo.
 He was dressed in a tight grey leather uniform of some sort; a number of
 insignia adorned it.
 He was wearing a rather large, vermillion cap adorned with a golden drake.
 He stood taller than the man sitting at the unremarkable table.
 The other man, in similar attire but with different insignia was quite
 critical of him:

The rabbit stays.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 cried the other one, stabbing a finger at Bo's directions.

Orders are orders, Jimbo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I haven't followed orders since the academy, for crying out loud.
 Even then, I mostly pretended,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the man called Jimbo and shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well you better follow these orders.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Hey Tark, let me ask you.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Aliens?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the man sitting down filled in promptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Isn't that a bit harsh? We're all aliens to one another, aren't we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Jimbo with a slight touch for the philosophical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, they're not human,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark, sitting at the table while staring at Bo as if the bunny somehow
 held some sort of truth for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

They certainly look human, some of those Ygg do,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 commented Jimbo and scratched his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Appearances can oft be deceiving,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Tark told Jimbo and stared at him for just a moment.

Now there, you sound just like Jameson.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Ah, those were the days.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Jimbo with invigorated interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you must know,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and sighed before adding, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was in Naval Intelligence.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Whizzers! You must be costing them a small fortune, eh?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Jimbo exclaimed with renewed enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not really.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How come?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Jimbo with eyes that begged to be humoured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Because I'm not really working for them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Jimbo looking genuinely puzzled.
 The next moment, Tark's hand connected with the back of Jimbo's head with
 a violent chop.
 Jimbo crumbled on the wet, musky floor with a dull thud.
 Tark didn't waste a moment; he carried the unconscious Jimbo to a shadowy
 corner of the impromptu holding cell area.
 He bound his head and his feet together, and made sure to gag his mouth
 with a ragged piece of cloth that somehow stood out.
 He couldn't help but notice the weaving: it was an Elvish pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he was about to grab the crystal from the throne and leave, he saw Bo's
 eyes flare up.
 Tark took a step back reflexively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Emperor's bones!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said surprised.
 Bo's eyes then flared up white hot before shooting a thick beam of blinding
 fire at the bars that held him captive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small cloud of evaporated metal rose from the bars and wafted harmlessly
 towards the exit.
 The rest of the bars were now a molten pool of metal, sizzling as they
 cooled off on the oak floor.
 Tark's eyes widened with restrained shock; he put one hand to his utility
 belt and went for an oddly shaped knife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was just then that Bo jumped gracefully about four feet in the air as
 if his feet were nothing more than springs.
 Bo landed on Tark's shoulder who had neither the time, nor the capacity
 to turn the blade in his hand towards Bo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without so much as a squawk, Tark was doubly surprised when he felt a thin
 strand of whiskers, followed by a wet, pink sliver of lips touching his
 mouth.
 Bo had kissed him and then conveniently jumped off.
 Presently, the bunny rabbit sat at the table, eying Tark intently but without
 the characteristic flames that sprouted from its eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll be damned!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 exclaimed Tark.
 Little did he care if he attracted the attention of the swarming neophytes,
 guards and mercenaries of the Ygg, milling about in the labyrinthous, bulk
 of the giant space-faring oak they had hollowed out and turned into a factory.
 All that, along with his up to that point successful infiltration felt
 like another life entirely.
 The single most important thing in his life at that moment was that a rabbit
 had kissed him on the lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still stunned in place and unable to comprehend, he heard a sweet melody
 echoing in his mind.
 The melody soon cleared up into a young woman's voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do not be alarmed, Tark.
 I'm an ally, of sorts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This place reeks of dark magic!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Tark ominously under his breath, for a moment searching for a way
 to flee as if an unseen foe was after him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're right about that, but it's not me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the voice said and Bo's nostrils flared up, its whiskers writhing about
 nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The bunny? The voice..
 That voice is coming from the bunny?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm afraid so,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the voice in Tark's head, while Bo sat down on all her legs and dug
 her head between her front paws snugly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How is that possible?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Tark audibly.
 He had a feeling the bunny was telling the truth, even though he had no
 idea why that feeling made the least bit of sense to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, it is magic.
 But it's not dark magic.
 I'm on your side.
 I think,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Bo and scratched the table nervously with one paw for just the barest
 moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My side? Who do you work for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

No-one.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I find that even harder to believe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark stiffly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well you should.
 I work for myself.
 And my brother.
 And some friends.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That makes for a preposterous cover story.
 You must be telling the truth, then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Tark commented with a feeling of sarcasm while checking the way in and
 out of the holding area quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I really am,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo voiced in Tark's mind, somehow managing to sound a bit hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, it's been really interesting, but I've got a job to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

 she asked bluntly.
 Tark froze barely for a moment before putting on an opaque facade over
 his face.

 said Bo and fidgeted around the table, the bunny in her trying to have
 a go at the wooden surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Look here, there's a lot more at stake than a bunch of slaves.
 Plus, the place is mostly empty,

 said Tark, making sure to keep his voice down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Bo sent in his mind and the whiskers on her nose stood upright as if electrifie
d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You do not have the clearance for that kind of information,

 said Bo in his mind and suddenly her eyes flared up with a torrent of fire.
 Two tiny pulses of fire shot past Tark and landed on the face and chest

 Tark's back.
 Tark looked coolly at the slightly charred body which was lying face-first

 Tark replied while scanning the road ahead.

 Somewhere along the corridor they were on, a swath of bright light seemed
 to emerge.
 He scoffed and whispered:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

The reason I'm here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 whispered Tark almost inaudibly as they made a left turn on a slightly
 upwards sloped rough path.
 Brilliant orange light poured down on them.
 It didn't seem to be the usual torch light, roughly dispersed along the
 maze-like corridors they were walking through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what might that reason be?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bo asked silently.
 No answer came until they reached the very end of their path, where a tiny
 ledge stood.
 It was so rough and sudden, that Bo nearly leapt off it.
 Once she stood there though, she really longed for her human body.
 She needed to gasp.
 Instead, her nose twitched while the vista filled her rabbit vision.
 Tark laid low on one knee and simply said:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tark and nodded.
 They were looking at the very core of the giant oak, a sparse, hollowed
 out expanse wide enough for a small city to fit from one end to another.
 Through the very center rose a sharp, multi-faceted crystal, shimmering
 with gold and silver, blue and white trailing lines like strands of heavenly
 hair wrapped around it.
 Concentric rings of pure white light seemed to hover in the air around
 the crystal; there was no end of them in sight.
 The crystal itself rose interminably high, lost in a blinding, twirling
 sea of white and blue, while at its very base a red and orange swarm of
 pulsating multi-coloured lights frothed inside a hazy, lava-like cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There was a cluster of eyes overlooking Parcifal as she sat at the bar,
 pensively withdrawn over a mug filled with a sizzling, steamy liquid.
 The bartender was apprehensive, at best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal wasted no time; she downed the mug in one go.
 The wooden bar she was sitting at though in no pristine condition to begin
 with, was now filled with holes of varying sizes.
 At some places, there were even small holes through and through, even down
 on the floor.
 Around Parcifal, as if there was somehow an area of effect about her nearly
 three feet wide, sat no-one.
 In a place as packed as the `Long Distance Mariner', or El-dee-Em as the
 regulars called it, three feet was quite a wide berth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind her there was a pile of smashed, half-eaten mugs that was almost
 knee-high.
 A couple of rowdy fellows were passed out right beside the pile; they had
 insisted that Parcifal was in need of some `good ole barnacle busting'.
 Feeling gracious, Parcifal had only knocked them unconscious - most of
 their teeth had already been missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that tiny altercation, she had the El-Dee-Em's attention.
 It was a place rife with seadogs, roughnecks, hands-for-hire, pirate wanna-bees
 and space drifters, shady characters and sultry maids with less honor than
 a judge.
 Everyone of them couldn't help but stare at the feisty redhead clad in
 armor that seemed to have guts wrought out of iron.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Keep them coming,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Parcifal and put some more coin on the bar for the bartender to see.
 For a moment, he stared at the coin before turning his gaze on Parcifal.
 He looked the sort of the old, retired pirate who had enough of a mind
 and a leg left after all the groggin' and the pillaging to settle down
 and go for the steady money of a sailor's bar.
 He had grey and white strands of long hair tied together and a thick moustache
 that made drinking beer a waste of good foam.
 His skin was worn over time and the trepidations of playing one's life
 on the line every day; but his eyes were an untouched sapphire blue and
 a shiny, pristine matter.
 There was a story going around that he had cried just once in his life,
 when his parrot died in a freak cuisine accident.
 This was only the second time then.
 His voice was an awed, trembling mess.

Parcifal was suddenly glowing with a bright blue light, from her waist up.
 She looked at Encelados; even through the sheath, it was flaring bright,
 almost blinding.
 When she looked back upon the bartender, the same sapphire blue eyes were
 staring at her; but all the rest about him was a dark-skinned nightmare,
 very much like Hobb.
 A maw lined up with tentacles reached for her neck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the serenity of a monk and the speed of a mongoose, Parcifal moved
 out of the way with her eyes closed, her head drooped down.
 In one fluid motion, she unsheathed Encelados with her left arm and with
 an upwards sharp stroke she turned the blade against the tentacles and
 the creature's head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Milky-white blood sprouted for the neck of the once perhaps human bartender.
 Encelados was still filled with violent light, the thick liquid staining
 its otherwise immaculate surface.
 She then heard a sound like no-other; it was as if someone was stomping
 grapes made of glass.
 Parcifal's face showed some instinct other than self-preservationl; it
 was sudden, primal fear.
 She knew things would not be easy, but she wasn't prepared for this.
 Some more commotion; a number of thuds, a few croaks and the sound of flesh
 being robbed of life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She turned around in time to see more than half the El-Dee-Em's patrons
 on their last dying throes.
 Some were being choked by tentacles, others were already deadly surprised
 by a stab on the chest and most had found death while passed out drunk
 with their mugs in hand and their skulls cracked; brain matter oozed like
 a bag of spilled beans.
 The rest of the patrons had taken on their true forms; blue-eyed, tentacle-line
d maws, dark of skin, devoid of heart or goodness.

The monsters paused in their stride suddenly, no more than a dozen feet

 It sounded like a deranged kind of laughter.

 Parcifal was already on the move, her senses helping her mind see her path
 against the threats all around her.
 The next moment, two severed clawed hands were still writhing on the murky,
 white-blooded floor; the Ygg shot its short tentacles in blinded agony.
 Parcifal leapt gracefully into the air, wielding Encelados with exemplary
 strictness of form.
 An eerie shriek filled the `Long Distance Mariner' - it sounded like the

 Strangely, a flash of recollection overcame her.

Lemmy's was a bar situated at the very top of Tallyflop, built on a giant
 platform right on the rim of the oak's giant hollow main trunk.
 Surrounded by lush gardens, art carvings and statuettes, Lemmy's was a
 synonym for opulence.
 A stark contrast to the less refined and a lot slummier promenades of Tallyflop

 That being said, its clientele consisted mainly of slavers, contraband

 Not a moment later, he was twirling like some sort of exotic, drunken dancer

 By an unfortunate timing of events, what would've been a rather forceful
 nudge, ended up being a kick in Winceham's private parts, which as is the
 case with most humanoids, translates to a world of pain.
 Winceham went out of breath, double over and fell sideways like a dead

 clenched teeth.

A small, tiny bell chimed and a wide door next to the bar slid open to one

 Lernea's eyes went wide and her jaw dropped to the point where it probably
 hurt like hell.
 Then she just pointed a finger at the open door, fainted and landed on
 Winceham who was only then beginning to breathe again, the pain starting
 to subside.
 As luck would have it though, her elbow struck Winceham's sensitive nether

 He let out a cry of anguish and passed out as well.

The air was filled with the smell of stew; it rode aloft in the night air
 like a thick, sweet and sour delight.
 Ned had offered to cook; it was one of the few things he was familiar with
 ever since working alongside his father at the Sniggering Pig.
 As he stirred the broth in the pot, he couldn't help but throw a few glances
 at Judith's lithe figure sleeping a few feet away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first Judith had insisted cooking; she was worried that even up high
 on the tallest, farthest branches of the oak, under the cover of thick
 brush and leaf, with noone in sight a mile out, the tiny column of smoke
 from their campfire would attract unwanted attention.
 Ned had burst in laughter at Judith's overly paranoid seriousness, even
 though there was ample reason to be worried, even though she had saved
 his life.
 Ned's reaction had a curious effect on her; she had decided that getting
 some overdue sleep was more important than light discipline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just for good measure though, she'd quickly gathered some brush to cover
 up most of the fire.
 A small, wet piece of cloth was set up like a tent above the pot, to absorb
 some of the smoke.
 There were all sorts of small details she never seemed to stop paying attention
 to; her mind and body were in constant movement, never idle, always a step
 ahead.
 Ned couldn't help but marvel at her for all the right and all the promiscuous
 reasons.
 He was grinning like a dolt, mindlessly stirring the soup, his gaze fixed
 away into the distance, at the very lip of the treetop.

That's were we're going.

 said Judith without so much as a yawn.
 She was already up and around, stretching her muscles, taking short, deep
 breaths.
 Ned turned his head around to answer and almost fell on his back, as if
 something had bit him; with one hand he covered up his eyes while with
 the other he tried to blindly propel himself back on the small log he had
 been sitting.

Judith furrowed her brow; she thought Ned was kind of a throwback, a fish

 Then she realized that for some reason all the other, nudity was frowned
 upon where Ned came from.
 She could respect that; she put on the inner, linen suit of hers.
 It was a one-piece affair that kept the body warm or cool, depending on
 the need.
 She looked at the lip of the treetop; Lemmy's and the Elevator were visible
 on the large platform, as well as the narrow, three-mile long, corkscrew
 staircase that hugged the tree's bark all the way up to the top.

Judith turned away from the sight of the treetop.

 She sought his eyes, but still Ned would just stir the pot.
 She smiled thinly.

 Where are you from, really? You don't seem well travelled.

 her swords.
 She swerved the other way and took hold of a small, hefty, brick-like whetstone.

 The sound was keen and sharp, not unpleasant at all.

 Ned shrugged and smiled thinly, feeling a bit embarassed though he'd be
 loathe to admit it.

I don't think of myself as someone who takes grave offense easily, Judith.

I'm not sure.
 I can only see so far into the future, it doesn't really matter what I
 want, does it? A couple of weeks back, I was cleaning up tables in my father's
 tavern.
 Now, my father lies buried and people are trying to kill me and my friends
 left and right.
 For crying out loud, I'm sitting on a giant oak that's floating across
 space,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ned earnestly and shrugged.
 He let out a little laugh, shook his head and looked around him.
 It was as if he still couldn't believe half of what was going on.
 Judith stared at him intently; she was measuring him, judging him, but
 not unkindly so.
 At length, she picked up her other sword and began sharpening it as well.
 She started to tell a story.

There was a time, not so long ago, that I wasn't all that different from

 I was a farmhand, at a far away place.

 A roof over my head, and a bed to lie down.

 Ned broke the silence without warning.

Judith's face became suddenly taught.

I'm afraid I've really lost track of him, back when the orcs attacked you.
 But he's safe from the Ygg, as are all the others.

 Tark's got good reason to believe you were the folks who foiled a recent

 said Judith and walked to her backpack.
 She reached inside and produced a perfectly flat, mostly unassuming slab

 She touched it and thin silver and golden strands of metal started running
 across it's surface as if a writhing mass of shiny worms fought on its

 The bits of metal settled in less frivolous patterns.
 It was like a living sculpture; cold metal flowed across its surface as

 Ned retorted, having already secured the line they'd come up with through

 Judith nodded silently and put on the rest of her leather suit with amazing

 She picked up her swords, passed the thin, extremely strong line through
 a special kind of hook and looked at Ned meaningfully.
 As she was about to push off the ledge and start descending, Ned shot her

 This time they were looking at the inside of the hollow oak; they were

That's the part of the plan I can safely assume everyone is familiar with.

\begin_layout Standard

It stands to reason, that whatever it is they hope to gain by using that

 You, Hanul, are that missing part.

 From afar, it looked like the huge bear was about to chew Theo's head off,

Lernea and Winceham instinctively sought each other's gaze; they looked
 like they were about to ask something, but thought better of it.
 Lernea scrubbed her face with her hands for a mere moment, and decided
 to pretend she hadn't heard.
 She closed her eyes and let herself sink in a deep, almost unbreakable
 concentration.
 Winceham on the other hand, was looking at Tej, focusing at his behinds.
 Seeing nothing but fur, he stroked his beard, nodded to himself and thought
 no more of the matter.
 Tejwel answered Theo with a rumbling, yet caring and somber voice.

The bear smiled and looked again out through the Elevator's giant glass
 pane.
 The whole elevator was the size of a large room in a hexagonal shape.
 Held tight between brass and steel rails, it connected the very top of
 Tallyflop's giant oak to its very bottom and Tejwel's sanctum.
 No-one but Tejwel and the Rat had the keys that allowed its use.

As I understand it, you have a more thorough understanding of Theo than

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 commented Winceham.
 Lernea did not care for any of that; she was breathing heavily, meditating,
 preparing.
 Even as she stood upright, she looked more and more like a statue.
 The light from the crystal cast a tall, defiant shadow of her form.
 Her face was abnormally serene.

 said Lernea suddenly cutting in.
 She was flexing her muscles; the cracking of air went along with her movements.
 A rather new sense of preparedness flashed accross her face; her eyes shone
 wildly.
 Winceham had seen that look before.

The Elevator then began to slow down.
 They were fast approaching a ring of concentric, circular and hexagonal
 corridors that seemed to float of their own accord.
 They were connected by strands of thick, multicoloured light, wide enough
 for a man to walk on.
 It was as if a clockwork machine had been spilled carelessly in the air,
 yet still it was possessed of a natural order.
 At the very center of the rings stood the large, bright crystal; it was
 imposing, impervious to the eye.
 Layers of opaque matter glistened through mirror-clean surfaces.
 Irregular shapes and reflections dodged light and shadow in an equally
 mystifying way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the very first ring that stood strangely still and motionless, one could
 easily spot four menacing, dark-skinned figures, wearing plain robes.
 A shiny gem stood out on each one's forehead; it seemed to change its colour
 capriciously, like oil does on water.

What did I ever do that makes me a leader? I can hardly hit anything with

The trapdoor.

 Judith answered without turning to look around, her focus on the wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Because that's the last place where the eyeslab picked up Parcifal.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and the copper panel was pushed back with the loud click of a
 spring.
 She then slid it aside to reveal a passage hewn into the tree's bark, large
 enough for a tall man to walk unhindered.
 Faint amber light seeped through the far end.
\end_layout

Apres vous,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ned whispered and followed close behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They remained silent for a length of time.
 The hollowed out part of the bark seemed to twist and turn roughly; it
 was as if whoever had opened the passage couldn't do so in a straight line.
 If it wasn't for the passage's walls, the faint light at the far end wasn't
 enough to guide them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they moved forward, the light became more intense.
 Then Judith stopped abruptly.
\end_layout

 Parcifal thought provided an answer to the main question at hand.

Having a good time with that lady friend of yours? I'm pretty sure she's

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Who's that?

 Ned asked but Judith didn't reply.
 She simply shot past Parcifal who sidestepped at the last moment.
 Ned was next; she shot Parcifal an uneasy smile to which she replied with
 a heartfelt mocking grin.
 They were inside a small opening inside the bark, where a peculiar sort
 of lantern cast shadows against a man wearing some sort of uniform.
 A bunny was happily munching away on something that grew out of the floor.
 Two more passages seemed to lead to what looked like a whole network of

The Elevator came to a stop.
 The dimmed, darkened glass pane opened sideways, like a hatch.
 Directly in front of them, down three small steps, stood the Ygg representative

 Winceham was already plying his trade, unseen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Enginseer,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the Ygg in unison; their combined voices sounded like a nest of insects

\begin_layout Standard
Tej did not return the greeting.
 He simply walked outside the Elevator slowly, calmly.
 He did not return the Yggs' stares.
 The others followed close behind.
 Lernea grabbed Theo by one hand, and shoved him forward suddenly, treating
 him like one would a captive or a prisoner.
 Theo exclaimed:

 Lernea said with vehemence and twisted Theo's arm just hard enough for
 him to remain locked in an awkward, sideways position.
 By the look on his face, he wasn't sure whether it was something he'd said
 that had gotten Lernea so mad or if this was just part of some sort of
 plan he vaguely remembered agreeing to non-verbally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Him?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said one of the Ygg and pointed vaguely at Theo with one webbed, clawed

 One of the other Ygg shot an icy stare at Lernea.

\begin_layout Standard

It is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 But his stare was still hard as stone, set on the Ygg like a hound after
 its prey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

That crystal in your possession; it is merely a trinket compared to what

 Lernea held Theo down who looked puzzled, trying to ascertain if he was
 indeed on sale and for what price.

That's impossible! The thaumaturgic readings on that mammal were off the

 Theo's eyes darted to and fro the monsters.
 There was little with which to distinguish them visually.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 growled Tej.
 Lernea tried to look the part handling Theo like a slave, but her eyes
 were already scanning the horizon for a sign that Winceham had done his
 part already.
 She felt like she was coming down with a peculiar nausea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But that is what it means,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and another ring platform appeared from below and locked into place
 behind their own.
 Two Ygg were standing on it, slightly bigger and uglier in appearance however
 impossible it seemed.
 One of them had Winceham tied on a rope; he was completely paralyzed, stiff
 as a piece of wood.
 His eyes were stuck wide open in terror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo, this is going to get really ugly, really soon,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Lernea whispered to Theo, even though in the back of her mind she knew
 it didn't matter whether or not they listened to her anymore.
 She kept her calm and didn't appear shocked.
 Not even when the other Ygg dropped the pale, blood-robbed body of Rat
 at the platform, right behind the Ygg who did not seem to tolerate theatrics
 for long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A doppelganger will take his place.

 said one of the Ygg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's nothing normal about this place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea and let go of Theo who couldn't help but wriggle his wrists
 and try to get his blood flowing back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

That remains to be seen, woodkin,

 said one of the Ygg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was talking to my friend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo and pointed to Lernea.
 Another one of the Ygg cackled profusely, the same as before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which reminds me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the Ygg with a tone of pure malevolence.
 The Ygg looked at Tej knowingly.
 Tej looked at Theo and told him with the faint trail of a single tear running
 down his furry cheek.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm returning to the light that bears us all, Hanul,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Tej right before a pulse of white fizzling light tore through his
 chest, spattering blood and bones in a burst and toppling the giant bear
 off the platform.
 Tejwel's form fell down below, into the whirring machine parts of the huge
 crystal silently.
 Reveling in the way his words produced hurt in Theo's face, one of the
 Ygg said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The larger they are, the easier they fall.
 Isn't that another piece of what you call popular wisdom? Such an infantile
 oxymoron.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo's face remained still.
 It looked like he hadn't really seen what had happened.
 Lernea had left her bow behind; all that she carried with was her ceremonial
 dagger.
 It was a dull little thing, fit for show and tell.
 But she clenched her teeth and appeared ready to meet whatever fate lay
 in store.
 The Ygg approached them like a cat approaches a fanciful toy.
 Lernea told Theo, in all seriousness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I find death at your side suits me well, Hanultheofodor.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What did you call me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he asked flatly, without emotion.
 He wasn't looking at her, nor the Ygg.
 He was still looking at where Tej had been standing moments ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hanultheofodor.
 Isn't that your full name?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just a name really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and looked at the Ygg that had come within a single step of him.
 The Ygg looked back and let an abyssal gleam filter through his eyes; its
 tentacles writhed expectantly.
 Abruptly, the writhing stopped.
 Theo's eyes were closed, his arms extended.
 A vein throbbed on his head.
 He began to tremble.
 And so did the Ygg; all of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lernea stood motionless.
 Then she began to shake as well.
 Theo was floating a few inches above the surface of the platform.
 His face was drenched in sweat; his dreadlocks stood up in a bizarre, disconcer
ting fashion.
 He looked like a terrible, wrathful figure; not the timid, somewhat kludgy
 sorcerer other people usually saw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ygg struggled to move, to react; all that remained was a terrible realisatio
n in their eyes.
 The gems in their foreheads flickered with intensity; slowly their bodies
 drifted off the platform seemingly of their own accord.
 But Lernea knew that it was Theo that somehow did all that.
 She then felt the platform sway and start to gyrate oddly.
 Another tremor shook the world around her.
 She heard a terrible raucous of a thunder reverberating from deep below.
 Winceham, released from the Ygg's embrace fell on the platform's surface
 hard.
 It was the third time that day his tenderlies had received unwanted attention
 from blunt objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This can't be normal,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she whispered and was surprised to hear the voice of Theo flood her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing will ever be again, Lernea,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 his voice said and the Ygg were flung with blinding speed across the hollowed-o
ut space.
 It looked as if some being of immense power had pulled a sinister set of
 strings with all its might.
 Their bodies had become small affairs on a distant wall, white murky blood
 smearing it like a blotch of ink on paper, only every colour reversed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So that's how it feels,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo as he settled himself down, panting not from the exertion, but
 from a rampaging, burning sensation in his mind; he felt hate for the first
 time in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand what it is that I just saw.
 But this is not good.
 At all,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Lernea and wished for a set of wings for the first time in her life
 instead of her bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is what is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Theo brusquely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm talking about them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and pointed at the hundreds of Ygg pouring out from every recess
 and crevice around the inner bark.
 They filled the platform rings and rushed Theo and Lernea.
 Some were cradling ornate weapons spawned out of nightmares, others simply
 flew with all their might across the distance, screeching in their nameless
 voices, a single name:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Shubb-naur! Shubb-naur!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The huge crystal formed a crack on its outer layer; the rings had fallen
 out of sync.
 Everything appeared to be breaking apart.
 A terrible grinding noise had risen up from the very depths of the crystal
 assembly and it wouldn't die down.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Theo, I really am honored to die by your side!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted as to be heard.
 Theo only barely whispered a reply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Honor has nothing to do with this.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Noone dies!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted a voice above the din.
 Lernea looked behind her and saw Ned sweeping inches above her head only
 to grab Winceham in his arms a moment or so later.
 Not to far behind, a comfortable height up, a small, sleek twin-hulled
 ship floated elegantly amidst the crumbling chaos of the infernal crystal
 machine.
 Layers upon layers of crystal began to crack and shatter, giving off blinding
 amounts of light followed by scalding heat waves at random.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Throw me a line!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted Lernea.
 Just as she had finished her sentence, she saw a strange-looking thin blunderbu
ss firing off without ever seeming to be in need of reloading.
 It cut down the first lines of the Ygg with an outrageous hail of fire.
 But they would not double back.
 Even as the world around them became undone, it was as if a higher zeal
 compelled them to bring ruin to those that dared take the Ygg for fools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hasten thee, sister!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came back a loud answer; it was Parcifal, benting over the ship's rail
 and waving as if it wasn't clear enough where to look for her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you drop a line?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shouted back Lernea.
 Theo looked as if he wasn't aware of what was actually happening.
 Then as if he had a sudden moment of enlightenment, he sprang at Lernea
 without a care, ignoring the bright white shots of deadly light the Ygg
 were throwing at them.
 The floating ship wobbled slightly as a series of cannonshot sprayed havoc
 amongst the ranks of the Ygg.
 But still, they came.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theo fell on Lernea and threw her a couple of feet away right when she was
 just about to catch the line they'd thrown for her.
 She was about to start shouting obscenities she would have found quite
 distasteful herself, when a huge piece of rock smashed the ring platform
 in two, right at the spot where she was standing a moment earlier.
 Theo held her hand as they both slid off the platform and started falling
 down into a blazing inferno that seemed to rise with every beating heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ned saw them, as did Parcifal; but they were helpless, frozen in disbelief.
 Tark shouted by himself, while no-one had asked him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We need to fly off now; I can't risk the ship and the mission any longer!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Bo's eyes flared up with fire suddenly; the next moment Bo the Bunny
 leapt off the ship as everything around them began to look like thick grains
 of sand, sliding away into a sea of fire.
 The Ygg were lost in vortex of fire and ruin, chanting as they fell into
 oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No!

 cried Ned while Parcifal hang by a thread on the ship's rail.
 Judith held her back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's done!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she shouted, while Parcifal couldn't break free from her grasp.
 She fell on her knees, and letting go, she began to wail with every drop
 of her soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark led the ship on a steep upward course with a speed that no ordinary
 ship could handle; everyone had to hang onto something.
 As they shot up and away from the cataclysmic ruin, there was a bright
 blue flash of light like a broken piece of glass shimmers in the sun.
 Then every platform, every ring and piece of crystal along with all the
 Ygg was engulfed in flames.
 Bursts of lightning flared away and the sound of doom ripped past them
 like a howling tide.
 Ned caught a glimpse of that blue flash; all he knew was it looked out
 of place, even in a mess like that.
 In his heart, nothing was certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even Tallyflop looked like it was still standing though battered and shaken;
 all its lights were out and not a merry song could be heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parcifal was sobbing on Judith's shoulder with as much dignity as a princess
 of Nomos could muster.
 Judith found the feeling strange; she wanted to comfort Parcifal.
 She was ashamed to find out she had forgotten how.
 She simply hugged her and felt the tremors against her chest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tark had lit up a pipe, and was sharing it with Winceham who was still in
 shock, reliving another time entirely.
