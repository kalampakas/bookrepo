I sort of rather like the fellow.
 I think he's the kind of man that really goes out of his way when needs
 be.
 Even looks like he could take a bloody bullet if it came to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the general said while handpicking deliciously-looking morsels of meat
 from the buffet arrayed out in front of him, as if it had been arranged
 for his pleasure alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly, he turned to face his aide-de-camps, always three footsteps behind
 him, his medals, decorations, citations and merits dangling and jiggling
 with the equivalent effect of a dancing fool laden with bells and whistles.
\end_layout

What do you think of the man, Ure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the general, holding a saucy meatball in one hand and a small cheese
 pie in the other.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I think my opinion is irrelevant, sir.
 You seem to like the man, no matter what everyone else in High Command
 says.
 Is my place by your side threatened, sir?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Ure Bouvet, the general's aide-de-camps asked with a blinding smile, as
 if his career in the military depended on it; in fact ,it did.

\end_inset

Nonsense Ure, and you know it! I said the man could take a bullet for me,
 but he seems to attract an awful lot of them, especially after the incident
 in Manhigure.
 Besides, you know my taste in buffets all too well by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 General Ramit said and downed a small confection to punctuate the fact
 that he thought of Trecibal Ure as a masterful culinary tactician, which
 happened to be an appreciated talent in the higher echelons of the military.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you, sir.
 Still, you have to do something about him, sir.
 Perhaps offer him some sort of ah, contract? Or provide a charter of leeway?
 Legitimise his actions in the eyes of the world, sir.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General Ramit looked to ponder about something.
 It was difficult to say whether his mind was preoccupied with what Ure
 had proposed about the infamous Bel-Phon Affair, or the subtle choice he
 had to make between torto shells and gris-mas tarts.
 At length, he picked up a skewer of ortelot meat, a quality-assured fallback
 when it came to exotic buffets such as this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hubbub in the grand ballroom started to build up as more and more guests
 arrived and were announced ceremoniously, the general waving acknowledgements
 to people he could barely identify at such a distance even if he knew them
 in person, however unlikely that may have been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are these people, Ure? Anyone important I should care to ingratiate
 myself with?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general asked his aide, glancing at a throng of excessively overdressed
 people that seemed to be what passed as important at these parts of the
 Empire.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Well, there is Vice-Governor Anewilliad, Prince Regent Rewevelde, the Conglomera
te East representative De Burgess - a crafty devil if I may add so sir -
 and they all seem to be ogling over Ms.
 Dirae, the glamorous performer with the exceptionally long list of publicised
 affairs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ure grinned shamelessly.
 Extending his mental heel-clicking to the real world, he lightly bounced
 on the heels of his boots, imperceptibly swinging to and fro like a toy
 soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ms.
 Dirae, you don't say? Pray tell dear Ure, what does she perform?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general asked using his tongue as the most immediately available toothbrus
h, curling his moustache at an impossibly steep angle, fixing his gaze on
 the impressive lady like a sniper on his mark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Largest repertoire this side of the spiral arm, or so I hear sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ure stood at ease next to the general, an imperceptible air of lasciviousness
 permeating his words.
 It sounded as if the mere sight of the woman aroused him, in every sense
 of the word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I always had a soft spot for the arts, Ure.
 Think it's time to indulge myself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general asked without for a moment taking his eyes off the madame
 in question.
 He even put down a crab cake without bothering to finish eating it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you have made up your mind, sir.
 You seem committed to action now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ure said, positively brimming with enthusiasm as if a great city wall was
 about to be breached, ending a war and saving a planet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Indeed I have!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the general.
 He patted his mouth gently with a napkin and nonchalantly tossed it on
 the floor, hurrying to meet Ms.
 Dirae with large, parade-like strides, right about when a deafening shrilling
 sound with the reverberating qualities of a train wreck filled the ballroom.
 The chatter suddenly stopped, and so did the band.
 The people in the crowd exchanged confused glances, right before the first
 shell landed at an uncomfortably close distance, the great glass observation
 panes offering a splendid view.
 Along with a burst of flames, thick red clouds of dirt and smoke, the crowd
 reflexively erupted in panic and disarray while the rest of the barrage
 started to fall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Talk about bad timing sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Ure yelled above the mounting din, while scrambling to get both himself
 and the general to their carriage with an even number of extremities still
 attached to their bodies.
 As he motioned to the befuddled guardsmen to make way for them through
 the crowd, he could see the terrified guests bump onto each other, running
 wild like headless chicken.

I thought the damn Dusikos could not bear artillery on Ciriad, especially
 not the First Quarter!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general exclaimed before calmly picking up his cap and arms.
 He took a fleeting look at the grand ballroom, eyes narrow but unfocused.
 He added while straightening his cap:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's only a ballroom sir.
 Not that important in my opinion, sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ure while leading the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was talking about the city, Ure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 retorted the general, looking far more grave than when his immediate concern
 had been the intimate knowledge of Ms.
 Dirae's repertoire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ure remained silent while navigating through the mayhem of the hapless crowd.
 Guardsmen and naval officers on duty tried to maintain some sort of composure,
 shouting evacuation guidelines to people that only read about artillery
 barrages in the papers.
 Fortunately, the needlessly large, ornate gates had been left wide open;
 a deeply ingrained sense of etiquette and manners rather than frosty calmness
 had prevented a truly wild stampede, no casualties so far.
 General Ramit shouted to Major Ure in order to be heard:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, we must not set a bad example Ure.
 Calmly escort me to the exit, no need for an alarm.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ure had been the General's aide since the start of the campaign on Dusik
 nine months ago, long enough to understand that the General was a peculiar
 man, but certainly he hadn't sounded as daft ever before:
\end_layout

But, sir! They are shelling us!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General smiled reassuringly as he smoothed his white gloves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If they had, we'd be dead already.
 There's time enough to get to our carriage.
 Let's not add to the panic.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trecibal nodded reflexively and kept pressing through the mass of people,
 unwilling to voice his objections while artillery shells kept exploding
 nearby at a steady rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were soon outside in the courtyard; the streaks of incoming shells
 painted a thin impressive grid in the mauve sky, while explosions near
 and afar lit up the dusk with fiery undertones.
 The harrowing sound of incoming large bore missiles, like skytrains passing
 by overhead was deafening.
 People all around were fleeing, on foot, horseback, or car, and even military
 personnel seemed at a loss, uncertainty emblazoned across their faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ure spotted their carriage; their driver was signalling frantically for
 them to run, rather than walk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General did not seem to be in a hurry, though.
 Ure reached the carriage first and opened the door for the General; he
 could hear the driver mumble some sort of prayer or perhaps a curse, gnawing
 at his teeth nervously.
 They exchanged a couple of knowing looks, before the General finally got
 inside.
 He shouted with a practiced air of authority:
\end_layout

Field Command, my boy!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sighing with relief, the driver let loose the horses, always eager to run
 away from the exploding shells falling around them in precarious quantities.
