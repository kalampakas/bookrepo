I remember the methane snow flakes and the carbon ice, the first time around. The landscape around the Plume had unusually eerie feeling. Even a really long displacement such as the one I was going through now could not approximate the feeling. The memory somehow made the hair on my back rise. A distant, logical and pedantic part of my troubled, aching mind sought to inform the other part \uc1\u8211\'96 the instinctive, impulse-driven part \uc1\u8211\'96 that technically, I had no hair. No back for that matter either.}{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

In a sense, it wasn\uc1\u8217\'92t even me waiting to re-integrate across the other end of the Plume. It was just a taste of me, or rather an idea of me, a gestatum of awareness: a complete mental state, a simulacra of my mind in even the tiniest brane-induced wormholes and superstring matrices that made me who I effectively was. }{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

I\uc1\u8217\'92m still not sure whether or not it was only a joke. Can\uc1\u8217\'92t really tell; the Olon seems wonderfully impervious to serious talk. It feels like being able to talk to God, a God with a sense of humor and an immodest amount of dislocation from the universe. For one thing, the talking makes the process endearing.

The long, sleepless waiting \uc1\u8211\'96 the nanoseconds that stretch into infinity and twist and bend and bog me down every single time. Inescapable, terminal boredom when every thought can be counted and analysed, repeated, rinsed of logic and sentiment, leaving nothing but a dull echo in my mind.

It seems that even if I am the only one in thirty-two billion human souls that can confer with Yar across the Plume, I\uc1\u8217\'92m not especially suited to the task. Sometimes I wish I wasn\uc1\u8217\'92t at all, other times I wish I could just turn the switch and displace as if it was as normal as breathing. Sometimes I wish I could just steer away from the Plume, get lost somewhere where I could not be found, somewhere beyond the infinite I have so casually embraced. I wish I could roam free, beyond the Plume's imaginary walls; take a sabbatical. Go on vacation. Lose myself in the greater neighborhood of the cosmos.

It was probably because he believed I couldn\uc1\u8217\'92t do that, and as with pretty much anything, he was right. I couldn't, the smart boys and girls in the lab coats couldn't, the massive computational grids couldn't. The technical term the collective of Nobel prize winners, multiple patent holders and ground-breaking scientific prodigies had come up with was \uc1\u8216\'91double glazing\uc1\u8217\'92. }{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

That space in between, that space beyond the abnormal space of the Plume that I could feel or 'see', wasn't even space they said. It was a medium, a conveyor, but not like the Plume. It was a kind of appropriately demure punishment for amounting to little more than a flee in the larger scale of cosmic evolution, to ride on the same subway across the stars, everyday, to the same place, talk to the same person. What a job though. More than that: what a ride, to ride the plume.}{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

I played out a lot of fantasies involving myself. It was an advice Yar had given me and had paid off handsomely, saved some of my sanity.

There were no bars or limits: in the realm of transluminar wave-particle inference entity projection, I was more than king; I was God. It was my domain. And without all the moments I had wished I was dead, I could not have cherished the moments when I felt myself oscillate in tune with the universe, or at least what little of it I could feel and see through the Plume. }{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

They only cared about the answers, though. They rarely paused to stop questions. At least not once they had room temperature fusion, teleportation, cellular rejuvenation and a whole new bag of tricks. There was a singularity effect; the world would never have been ready for such big news. Small wars were fought between ancient mindsets and cutting-edge weapons.

The lab monkeys got drunk that day, which was a first in oh, so many years. It looked like the people on Earth were getting used to all the fancy technologies and science leaps everyday. It was only so much they could absorb, so little time to care.

Then someone dug a little deeper, and found out I couldn't simply know the things I scrawled everywhere when I went into catalepsis.

A general had asked me, while I still retained the capability, `Do you know we've put more resources into you than in all of recorded history?'.

Too valuable to throw away, too dangerous to let be. The wealth of data coming in through my cortex was the answer to all of their prayers, and reason I started to believe in God. To believe in me. No-one shutdown the test ever since. No-one dared lose the connection to the most precious source of knowledge in humankind's existence. They brought more technicians, more engineers, more scientists. I think I tried to kill myself once. That was something they didn't want. They made some more permanent arrangements, and they always let the lights on. I didn't know then I would never again see the sun with my own eyes.}{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

All sorts of antibiotics and cell treatments to keep me healthy. Keep the vessel intact, keep me going. But no-one dared touch my mind. No-one dared to let me out of my cage. And so I screamed, and cried, and went insane. But when I had no other life in me, I slept. When I slept, I displaced: I spent the time leading all the sorts of lives I wish I had the opportunity to live. And then I talked with Yar. The rough bits, the ones I couldn\uc1\u8217\'92t really understand, he just put them along inside my mind in what he called \uc1\u8216\'91lunch boxes\uc1\u8217\'92.

My real world, my true life, the one I did not imagine but the one I saw and touched, even through a copy of mine, even spread across a thousand different selves, was still mine; and I would cherish it and hold it fast against the echoes of my splintered soul even after I had found a way to blow my brains back in the lab.}{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

Displeased. Disappointed. Some said that perhaps they were going too far, others said there was noplace far enough after me. Maybe that's true too. What's real, what's real in the Plume, and what's real in my head cannot be unmade anymore. It's now taken on a substance of its own. Sometimes I think they know I'm not human now.
