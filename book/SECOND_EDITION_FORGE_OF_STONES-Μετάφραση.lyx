Ένιωθε ασυναγώνιστη στα μισοσκότεινα δώματα, η μορφή τής τόσο πολύ σάν αυτήν
 ενός στροβιλιζόμενου δερβίση.
 Οι μπούκλες των μαλλιών τής καθρέφτιζαν το πολύτιμο ελάχιστο φώς με μια
 γυαλάδα μελί και καφέ, όλο θαλπωρή.
 Μια αιθέρια μυρωδιά τριαντάφυλλου και λεβάντας αναδυόταν από το δέρμα τής,
 μεθώντας τις αισθήσεις.
 Κινούνταν σάν το έδαφος να ήταν απλά μια αυταπάτη που έπρεπε να αγνοηθεί,
 τα χέρια τής αμυδρά λυγισμένα πρός τα πάνω σάν σε προσευχή, ένα χάδι για
 τις λιγνές μορφές νεαρών θεών.
 Το πρόσωπο τής είχε μια έκφραση αγέννητου δέους, μαγευτικό το να το βλέπεις,
 απαραβίαστο στο άγγιγμα.

Χόρευε στους ήχους τυμπάνων που χτυπάγαν ακατάπαυστα, σε μοτίβα και ρυθμούς
 βαθείς και γάργαρους που φαινόταν να αντηχούν από τους τοίχους της ίδιας
 της ψυχής τής.
 Φαινόταν να ακολουθούν πίσω από μια μελωδία εγχόρδων καθάριων σαν μια βουνίσια
 πηγή που αναβρύζει.
 Σάν μια φρέσκια δροσιά που τύλιξε την αίθουσα, μιά ομάδα από φλάουτα καλούσε
 αόρατα πνεύματα, σάν μια αρχαία τελετή να γινόταν για την δική της ευχαρίστηση
 και μόνο.

\lang english
Η μουσική έφτασε σε ένα κρεσέντο, ένα αποκορύφωμα που έσειε τη γή.
 Αποτρέλαθηκε απ'το πάθος τής, εκδύοντας ένα μυστικιστικό αέρα του έρωτα,
 ένας φάρος του λιμανιού για όσους δεν γνωρίζαν την αγάπη.
 Μιαν αόρατη συμφωνία με μια μούσα καλούσε πίσω από κάθε χειρονομία πειρασμού.

Το αχνό αραχνούφαντο φόρεμα της στροβιλίστηκε, αδυνατώντας να περιορίσει
 Her faint gossamer dress swirled, failing to contain her ethereal form
 in such a breathtaking way, that even the flames of the brazers around
 the chamber flickeThe music reached a crescendo, a ground-shaking climax.
 She became frenzied with passion, exhuming a mystical air of love, a beacon
 of a haven for all the ones who were unloved.
 An unseen pact with a muse beckoned behind each tempting gestured in tune
 with her dancing form to cast shadows that seemed to have a life of their
 own.

The crowd around her was silent and still, wearing almost identical masks

A single man stood at the edge of the dancing stage.
 He was robed in heavy linen, his face unmasked for everyone to see.
 Tears were running down his cheeks, welling under his chin in an unwavering
 steady flow.
 His face was a painful mix of sorrow and awe, his eyelids closed shut in
 a vain attempt to contain his tears.

At the climax of her dance, she laid her body down on the stone floor, and
 planted her feet and hands on the stage with her back forming an arc.
 She start to convulse in a familiar but never spoken way, the way of ecstasy.
 Her pelvis moved to the rhythm of the drums, faster and faster, as if an
 invisible lover was holding her aloft, their bodies mingling with lust.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The music came abruptly to a stop and utter silence filled the chamber.
 She springed herself on her knees, her hair concealing her face completely.
 The silence was almost deafening.
 Her ragged, fast breath was the only sound that could be heard.
 Then, the unmasked man spoke while bowing solemnly:

 The dancer and the unmasked man still remained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

He extended his arms, palms facing upwards, a gesture to the dancer or mayhap
 the Gods themselves.
 She stood up on her bare feet slowly, her hands touching her thighs over
 her gossamer dress, strands of her hair upon her bare shoulders.
 He spoke softly now, as if not to be overheard, even though there was not
 a living soul around in earshot.

man dressed in dark crimson robes and a sky blue sash made haste up the

 chin was still awash with the wine he had spilled only moments earlier.

He kept repeating these words to the deaf, heavy-set stone walls, with almost
 every breath.
 The flickering flame of the torch he held cast shadows of his form over
 the stones of the stair's steps and the dank walls.
 It resembled the form of a stumbling, muttering old fool.
 Even the shadows seemed to mock him, crouching even lower than him as the
 staircase finally unwound onto the roof of the curatorium.

So, it has finally come to this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the old man as he caught his breath, and started off to find what
 it was he had come looking for.
 His mind was not as sharp as when he was young, and he was caught unprepared.
 He fumbled around the roof while the lukewarm dusk gave way to the chilling,
 gloomy cloudy night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He kept straightening his beard with one hand, keeping his eyes closed.
 His other hand was raised, waving a pondering finger in a hazy, uncertain
 rhythm.
 It looked as if it was trying to catch up with a silent tune only he could
 hear.
 Suddenly, he opened his eyes and set off with his head intently searching
 the floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The air smelled of liquorice and the burned wheat stalks of nearby farmsteads.
 It was the planting season.
 He looked annoyed, trying to pick up what seemed to be a loose cobblestone
 from the roof.
 It seemed to give no purchase and try as he might, he could not remove
 it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Standing upright, he folded his arms and breathed deeply, his elbows sagging
 slightly, his chin almost touching his chest.
 He sighed, and then abruptly erupted with a flurry of curses, kicks, punches
 and stomps.
 Quite an unseemly attitude for a person of his stature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

A Curator.
 By mutual assent among his peers, not a very prestigious one, but nonetheless,
 a Curator.
 The men had chased him up the stairs with profound alacrity and ruthlessness.
 Their drawn swords looked dull in the little light that was left, but the
 white of their teeth seemed to shine uncannily behind their wide grins.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he drew a few deep breaths before standing
 over one ledge from the roof and shouting, almost in a screech:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The curator leaned over the ledge, searching for a face to direct his ire
 at to no avail.
 He shouted once more, throwing his fists wildly into the air.
 The men drew ever closer slowly but surely, an air of supreme confidence
 about them.
 They had cornered him and there seemed to be no escape.
 The chase would be over soon now.

 The Curator felt a strange rush of stinging air, turned about slowly, and
 had time enough to yell one last time at his pupil:

As Hilderich ran outside the curatorium, his gaze locked with the despairing
 eyes of his master, whose last look implored him silently to live.
 One of the men lunged forward with his blade set to pierce the old Curator.
 The wizened form of master Olom for a moment seemed to sidestep the blow
 nimbly, but that was not so.
 The blade had struck true, and the old man fell on his back without grace.
 As the second man raised his blade for the final blow, they were both grinning,
 their faces showing their relish, their enjoyment.
 This was what they lived for, the rush of murder and the smell of blood.
 They went about it in revered silence, cherishing every moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich simply stood there for a moment, transfixed, overtaken by the
 speed and incredulity of what was taking place.
 Fear had crept up in him, and had saved his life.
 And it was fear now as well, that urged him to heed his master's order.
 In the next moment, Hilderich was running with eyes wide from horror, his
 hands gripping the green, flashy keystone with white knuckles.

 said the curator through the agonizing pain of the blade's blow while clutching
 his pendant.
 As the blade of one of his assailants came rushing down to meet his sternum,
 he was smiling with a glaze in his eyes, as if lost in a loving vision
 of the past.
 When he blinked next, himself, the curatorium, and the two assasins became
 a thing of the past.
 Bright white light suddenly filled the dusky plains accompanied by an eerie,
 unnerving silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich only felt a haze of heat and a tingling at the back of his head.
 He dared not stop or look back, he simply ran.
 And he prayed.

 grand audience hall was fabulously lit through grandiose arched windows

 Sunlight glistened off the brass and gold etchings everywhere around the
 hall, from chandeliers to decorative ornaments, invariably marked with

The jester played out the last part of the tune, merrily dancing around
 the main hall, a wide smile was carved on his painted, multicolored face.
 As he hit the last of the chords, he ended his performance with a wide

 his sole spectator, and waited there, until he heard a morose voice:

While he seemed to ponder the idea, the jester scurried soundlessly near
 the table where the goblet of wine lay, and with a wide grin forming on

 The Castigator took notice, but said nothing.
 Eyes darting to and fro, the jester sipped some wine off the goblet, his
 painted lips smearing its bronze, delicately decorated surface with white
 powder, red and violet paint.
 As the jester closed his eyes and savored the exquisite vintage, he felt
 steel like ice hard against his throat.

 feet were sore.
 Cold air rushed to meet his face, the flimsy cloak he wore offering a little
 less than adequate protection.
 Tall grass grew on either side of the rocky path through the hills.
 The cries of a crow accompanied the howling gusts of the wind and the sky
 was painted a bleak gray, just like it had invariably been for the last
 few days.
 He looked around, searching for some kind of shelter at least until the
 wind decided to die down.
 He knew he had to rest soon, his body ached and his legs felt like they
 were cast in stone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He spotted the large bark of a tree.
 It looked like a large hollowed out oak, grizzly and old.
 He made a dash of strained effort to reach it quickly as it lay further
 up the hill.
 A little more pain and then he could sit for a change, he thought.
 Perhaps even sleep, cold wind or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The oak was a perfect fit, large enough to lay down with only a small opening
 that even a lean man had to go through sideways.
 He was lean.
 As well as hungry, cold, tired and groggy.
 He put down his knapsack and grimaced from the pain of stiff, overworked
 muscles.
 He lay down on the ground, and felt like all his cares and troubles in
 the world had been suddenly lifted.
 He felt light as a feather and a sweet numbness encircled his senses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He stretched his feet and looked upwards, through a small crack on the bark
 that let the view of the sky seep in.
 His sight wandered to the clouds passing overhead, gray tinted whisps of
 smoke on a sea of blue and black, reminding him of forlorn shapes running
 through a twisting, foaming river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He closed his eyes and muttered a prayer, thanking his God for the timely
 shelter.
 He felt as if he was being looked after and cared for.
 To him, it was as if his pilgrimage was an extraordinary thing, a matter
 of unusually grave importance.
 He felt the mission he had to carry out was a mission worthy of every help
 and mercy.
 All he had to do was have faith, and he would persevere.
 His God would keep a watchful eye, and provide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Soon he fell asleep, laying there looking as dead as the wood around him.
 He dreamt, but he would remember nothing when he would wake up.
 His chest rose and fell with a slow, deliberate rhythm.
 All around the oak, the thin grass bend where the wind blew.
 The crows had stopped their crying and some of them were perched on the
 very same oak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A few drops of rain started to fall, and pretty soon the drops turned into
 a drizzle, thin and almost refreshing, a shower of a gift that the earth
 accepted eagerly.
 He was dry, and he was warm.
 He thought to himself, `God always provides' and fell into a dreamless
 sleep.

It is the will of the Gods for man to live as such, to be humbled by his

 For if it was man's destiny to live free as he desired, he would sooner
 rather than later turn upon his own, his desires becoming a fatal trap,
 a wretched condition any man worth living strives to keep in check daily,
 with prayer and the Law as his guide.
 For without the Law, what is man but a cunning animal?

 first thing that assaulted Hilderich's senses were the smells.
 Lost in a smelting crowd of city people, the smells were overpowering:
 the acrid sweat of unkempt horses mingled with rosewood and cinder scraps
 from the carpenters' workshops.
 Heavy spices like cinnamon and uwe flared his nostrils while an essence
 of oils and meats wandered through the air.
 The smell of filthy beggars waxing and waning around every corner, its
 temporary absence filled in with incense from close by temples and intoxicating
 perfumes from passing, illustrious carriages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The mix of sounds though felt familiar.
 It reminded him of bees buzzing through the meadows back home, whole swarms
 feeding on the nectar of roleva flowers over a golden carpet swaying gently
 under the evening gale.
 Now and then some voices stood taller than the rest, hints of tradesmen
 selling their wares and the ever present and watchful Ministers announcing
 laws, edicts, verdicts, punishments, and religious texts, all for the ears
 and minds of the good people of Pyr.
 The cacophony was further accented by the clacking sounds of hooves, the
 cries of pigs and the pleas of beggars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Tall arches overhead cast angled shadows everywhere, the walls of the buildings
 like sheer cliffs towering over the palpitating mass of people and animals.
 Blue-gray rock and lime mortar dominated the market's landscape, the wear-torn
 cobblestones of the streets a hazy washed white wherever the grit and the
 mass of people allowed a small glimpse.
 Street after street, wall after wall, bronze engraved plaques embellished
 with holy texts and iconography hung on arches, balconies and posts, in
 favor of the Gods, in memory and glory of the Castigator and the Pantheon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
If the market was the heart of the city as its inhabitants claimed, then
 the popular piece of wisdom Hilderich had heard about Pyr being a heartless
 bitch seemed at once both right and wrong.
 Every single cast, class and type of man was to be found here: they were
 buying, selling, begging, stealing, killing, blackmailing and dying, all
 in one place.
 He had also heard there were parts of the market where the suns had never
 shown upon them since the city was built.
 There were dark corners where those who entered usually did not reappear,
 and when they did, blood that was not their own had soiled them.
 From what he was seeing before his eyes, no story could do the place justice.
 Everything could happen in the market of Pyr, that much he could imagine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The beggars had become part of the landscape: blinds, invalids, all sorts
 of castaways and society's detritus were tugging away at embroidered hems,
 pleading with sore voices and grotesque faces.
 Those of them who bothered the wrong people time and again were soon beaten
 or stabbed to death by lackeys and guardsmen, left for dead on the same
 spot.
 As if that was not enough, they also seemed to attract the ire of some
 of the merchants and artisans for not having the decency to crawl away
 from near their workshops and stalls and die someplace else where they
 would not put off potential customers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But this was at the same time the place where everything of import came
 to be; this was where produce from the surrounding fields and indeed neighborin
g territories was gathered and sold to those who could afford it.
 This was where artisans created common everyday wares, materials and tools
 as well as delicate, commissioned works of art.
 This was the place were deals and partnerships were entered and broken,
 contracts signed and carried out.
 This was the place where everyone, whether a layman or a noble, had some
 kind of business.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
This was the place were the Ministers' chants were heard every day, preaching,
 teaching, and enforcing the religion that is Law.
 The market in that sense, was a living representation, a miniature of where
 and how the people of Pyr lived their lives, and even how some of them
 lost them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was drifting along the current of people flowing incessantly through
 the market, occasionally bumping onto variably indifferent or protesting
 men, trying to take caution of the treads of carts, running heralds and
 practicing pickpockets.
 He could hear the Minister from the next street calling out a long list
 of names, while his eye caught two men in an unlit alley cracking another
 man's skull, their shadowy outline briskly contrasted with the lit background
 of the large street that ran behind the small alley.
 It seemed dishearteningly clear that this was business as usual in the
 market, that some code of practice had been followed and the formalities
 obeyed, killing a faceless man hidden away from the light of the suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His almost random course took him closer to the Minister's spot, an elaborate
 fountain made of granite, engraved with scenes of an historic battle from
 the Heathen times he could remember learning about as a child but could
 not immediately recognize.
 The Minister held a distaff on one hand, heavy-looking and oblique, and
 was still reading names off a long unwinding scroll fitted in some kind
 of extensible hook on the distaff that seemed purposefully designed.
 He wore a long robe made of violet velvet with a gold embroidered hem and
 a silver-lined crest of the Outer Territories woven on his chest.
 On his head lay a small black cap with a single emerald denoting his office,
 and both of the robe's arms were filled with holy texts written in Lingua
 Helica, the Territories' formal language, stitched in purple silk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The ministers Hilderich had known made offerings to the Gods, upheld the
 Law and taught it to the people that looked to them for guidance in their
 daily lives.
 These holy men seemed somewhat distasteful, one might even call them pompous.
 He wondered what Master Olom's remark would have been and he was reminded
 of the duty he had yet to fulfill.
 He ignored the small mass of people gathered around the Minister as well
 as the rest of the still unfolding list of names, and lost himself once
 more in the throng of people.
 His senses had become acutely attuned by now, searching for a sign that
 would bring him a step closer to finding the one man he was searching for
 ever since that fateful night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He conjured in his mind a brief glimpse of that night, an almost morbid
 recollection of what had happened.
 He had barely had time to stop and ponder the minutiae, while trying to
 get to Pyr as fast as possible, the place where he had to start his quite
 possibly fruitless search.
 The more he thought about what had exactly happened, the more he failed
 to grasp how everything had come crashing down like an avalanche: the perfect
 stillness in his life had been washed away by sheer and utter terror, an
 unavoidable terrible fate.
 Such was the end of Master Olom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even though he would not admit to it, he felt he had somehow cheated death
 on that night, that it should have been him rather than his Master or at
 least he should have had the same luck, at least as a matter of principle.
 Thankfully wise master Olom, he thought, had believed otherwise and bought
 him time enought to live and make the most of his life.
 He would complete his master's lifetime work.
 He would not be doing it for his master's sake alone.
 If Olom had been right..
 Hilderich could not imagine the consequences that would imply.

Never pausing in his stride, Hilderich closed his eyes and clutched the
 keystone his master had entrusted him with ever so tightly.
 He had taken extra precautions ever since he had to carry the strange artifact
 with him.
 He always kept it on his person, and had fashioned a small metal holder
 with a small but sturdy chain fastened to his thick leather belt.
 The holder resembled the small cage of a sparrow.
 It was made of thin sheets of metal he had scrounged off the stables of
 an inn, the second day since he ran away from that explosion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He remembered that vividly.
 An inexplicable explosion of light and heat, the sound of hundreds of steam
 engines going off at the same time.
 It must have been something ancient, there was no other logical explanation.
 But his knowledge of the Old People and their ways and artifacts was little
 compared to his master's and as far as he knew, no such examples were in
 master Olom's care.
 Hilderich had never seen or heard any hint of such awesomely destructive
 or powerful items since his apprenticeship began.
 He was starting to warm to the idea that it had perhaps been the Gods themselve
s that were responsible after all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He let out a sigh without noticing.
 He looked crestfallen, his expression sour like unripe neranges.
 He had been so deeply engrossed in thought, that when he ventured a look
 around him he saw he was utterly lost, without a sense of direction in
 a part of the market conspicuously calm, lacking the overwhelming mass
 of people that at least offered him a false sense of safety that was neverthele
ss more welcome than none at all.

The far away din of the market proper could still be heard, but he had walked

 the corner of his eye he glimpsed a pair of shady figures that seemed to
 be stalking him, probably had been for a while, and from their earliest
 motions felt they were just about to gang up on him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was not a stoutly built fellow, and did not consider himself a
 man of action or someone capable of putting up a serious fight.
 But he had faith in his master's work, and his quest had to take precedence
 over everything else.
 He had to preserve his life in order to preserve the keystone, so he chose
 the most viable and logical course of action under the circumstances: he
 ran like hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He suddenly darted off towards the direction of what seemed to be a large
 bell tower, and ventured a slight look over his left shoulder to get the
 bearings of the figures behind him.
 They were just beyond hand's reach when he started running, his heavy cloak
 waving wildly, feet scurrying on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One of them cursed profoundly and the other one shouted at him to stop,
 then both of them went on a chase after him.
 Hilderich went right and left crossing through alleys and larger streets,
 sometimes under the cover of shadow and others under the sunlight, trying
 to keep the tower that somehow seemed a public, safe place in sight, as
 well as give his pursuers the slip.
 He thought that surely, they wouldn't dare have a go at him in a public

The sound of boots on stone was still unmistakably behind him.
 Sweat had started to pour out of his body.
 He went past small houses, inns, and squares, while fleeing for what would
 certainly be his life.
 Curiously enough his mind registered that not a housewife or elder man
 ventured more than an indifferent look at the chase taking place in front
 of their eyes.
 Only the children paused in their play to look startled and amazed, point

His feet started to ache and his breathing became short, almost painful.
 Fire welled up in his lungs and then he knew he could not keep this up
 for long.
 The tower he had set out to reach did not seem much closer than earlier.
 He ventured a slight look over his right shoulder, and couldn't see either
 of the figures chasing him.
 He listened intently for a few moments and could not make out the distinct
 noise of chasing boots, only rather his own two feet galloping achingly.
 He allowed himself a drop in pace and eased his breathing.
 He came to a slow stop near a shadowy wall, and bent over resting his hands
 on his knees.
 He threw scared looks around him, hoping that the chase had been over,
 that his assailants had somehow given up.

The man's gruff voice seemed to come through the wall of stone, but he was
 only hiding deeper into the shadow of an adjoining alley.
 Hilderich instinctively turned around and saw a flash of light hinting
 at an unsheathed knife or sword, its wholeness under the cover of dark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich drew enough of a breath to dart off again in another random direction,
 slipping away at the last minute like before, but then he noticed the other
 man: a red-haired bearded brute, pieces of armor showing underneath his
 shabby clothes with a jagged knife in hand.
 The big man stood a few paces to his right, steadfastly covering the only
 way out of his predicament.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With no real options left, Hilderich suddenly leaped on the man that had
 appeared from within the shadows, blade or no blade, in what could only
 really be a selfless last act of defiance.
 His mind flashed with the thought that he was soon about to die and fail
 his master for the last time.
 While he leaped he gathered his fist aiming for the man's head, trying
 to deliver as much pain as possible.
 His punch never connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The man still standing inside the shadows, expertly and calmly took a step
 back bending his back slightly, Hilderich's wild effort going awry.
 He hit nothing but air, lost his balance and made a counter-step trying
 to compensate.
 Just as he could feel his face freeze in astonishment, he brought his other
 hand backwards in order to try and have another go at punching his assailant.
 He did not manage that in any event though, because he winced and doubled-up
 at the paralyzing pain from the knee that had firmly and powerfully connected
 with his belly.
 He felt his stomach empty itself of its contents and his sight go blurry.
 A hint of red clogged his sight and his feet went limp and heavy, his breathing
 shallow.
 The last thing he saw before he passed out, was a grinning mouth and the
 icy clear flash of a steel blade.

She woke up with cold sweat on her forehead.
 Her temples damp, a few locks of hair glued against her face.
 She drew the bedsheets against her body, and curled up onto the empty side

 She felt the unborn child inside her stir uncomfortably, as if awoken with
 terror by the same dream as she.
 She laid her hands on her belly and gently caressed it, feeling the child

The unborn child fell silent, its tiny heart barely stating it was alive

 The mother, on the other hand, was still visibly shaken from her vision.
 She had seen rivers of blood engulfing her and her child, and fires bright
 as the suns all around her.
 She saw Amonas' head on a pike along with hundreds of other men's heads,
 hellishly put on display in a gory show.
 In front of them seething masses of animals, rather than men, were cheering

The hair on her back was raised and she felt as helpless as a thawing flake

 The few clouds overhead were like thin gossamer webs the Gods might have

The Ministry Tower and the Disciplinarium were lit as bright as day, their

The rugged brown stonework of the balcony felt rough under her smooth touch.
 She moved her hand unconsciously across the stone while gazing at the city,

 Her hand seemed to dance, ebbing and flowing to a melody even she herself
 couldn't hear, like conducting an invisible chorus of spirits of old that
 seemed to inhabit this very stone.

She closed her eyes momentarily and the image of Amonas' head haunted her,
 blood still pouring hot out of him.
 She held her breath and moved her lips in a silent prayer, wishing her
 dream was nothing more than simple fear and worry of whatever lay ahead.
 She thought to herself that her faith should not waver, that she must be
 strong enough for Amonas' sake and above all for the sake of their unborn
 child.
 She wished for the good winds of fortune to carry them forward and hoped
 that all would be as it should be.

Her child stirred once more, soothing her soul and bringing a faint smile

 Sleep overtook her in peace, her face a statue of serenity.
 She saw no more dreams or nightmares on that night.

Hilderich pondered this for a while and in his mind dismissed the idea that

 He precariously managed to reach the safety of a nearby table putting the

 Disciplinarium's large audience hall was exquisitely decorated with fine

Though night had already fallen, giant ornate silver and brass chandeliers
 hung from the high ceilings illuminating the grand hall with the light
 from thousands of candles.
 Their beams of light were enhanced and mirrored by all the brass, gold

 them glitter and shine, magnifying their splendor tenfold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Delicately detailed lifelike oil paintings adorned each wall: previous Castigato

 families of the Castigator.
 Every important person that was notably recorded in the zealously well-maintain

 paintings and sculptures from the most talented artists of each generation
 from around the lands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The mass of people was still flowing slowly but steadily into the hall,
 and for a time it would seem like the small swarm of men was going to swell
 to inelegant numbers.
 But the Castigator's people in charge of the eventful night, had meticulously
 planned who was to be given the praise of summons.
 They also decided on the time of each person's appearance as well as whether
 or not he should be given the privilege of being able to dine at the same
 table as the Castigator.
 Albeit always at an innocuous distance a table seating on the Castigator's
 table implied an immense elevation in status and almost unrivaled political
 power.

As the time for the opening ceremonies for the grand festive night grew
 closer, all the needed preparations were being doubly checked and the gathering
 of guests efficiently monitored.
 Everything seemed to be in place, refreshments and drinks served in silver
 plated cups; sweetmeats, fruit, and fine pastries circulating among the
 crowd in golden platters by busy servants dressed in fine cloth wearing
 the green livery of the Castigator's office: a white eagle bearing a book
 and a key, a snake held in its beak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
People were chatting in low voices, politely exchanging greetings and news
 of the lands, though some of the more brazen guests that either lacked
 the knowledge of etiquette or were in a position to ignore it as a whole
 or in part, were already laughing heartily at jokes or anecdotes between
 friends and close acquaintances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Everyone attending had been careful to dress as stylishly as possible, and
 according to wealth and status there were examples of extravagant overdressing,
 with some people closely resembling moving heaps of gold and silver, like
 treasure-laden mules.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Others preferred to overstate their presence with exotic cloths and tailorings,
 usually uncommon and outlandish, suggesting time and money had been spent
 just for this one occasion.
 Indeed everyone was wearing the best and brightest they could afford, and
 maybe some had even took on a loan to have something special tailor-made
 in order to try and stand out in the crowd, in a certainly desperate bid
 to improve their fame and fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The atmosphere in the hall was generally convivial though mildly restrained
 because of the premises and significance of the night.
 The festivities were taking place in order to commemorate the Castigator's
 25th Term in Office, which coincided with the anniversary of the Pacification
 of Zaelin, the last of the Territories to be enlightened and brought under
 the Law of the Pantheon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Rumors circulated among the nobles' elite as well as people in the army
 and the Ministry that the Castigator would be announcing a decision of
 major importance that would stir up the relatively still and quiet recent
 affairs of the Territories, perhaps ushering a new era of glory to the
 Gods, and perhaps for the people as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In any case it promised to be an eventful night, with dancing troupes of
 wondrous abilities, unsurpassed technique and airy grace performing for
 the duration.
 Bards of worldly renown and enchanting voices had prepared to sing the
 Mythos in praise of the Castigator and the Pantheon, a telling re-enactment
 of the Pacification of Zaelin and the striking down of the last Heathen;
 Parnoth Larthiel, the Last Ignorant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The re-enactment would also offer a kind of prize to one of the guests who
 would be lucky enough for his name to be drawn amongst hundreds: he would
 have the chance to play as the Castigator in the final duel with Parnoth,
 the unclaimed role filled in by a lawbreaker due for execution.
 The honored guest in killing the lawbreaker-Parnoth would be spilling heretic
 blood in the service of the Ministry, the Castigator and the Law.
 It was quite possibly the highest service to the Pantheon possible, save
 sacrificing one's self while enforcing or upholding the Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A huge oblong platinum chime resounded by the stroke of an ornamental ram
 swung by two Protectors, the Castigator's personally hand-picked guard,
 and judging by their imposing physical builds apparently chosen chiefly
 for their brawn.
 The sound of the chime drowned out the chatter of the milling guests; it
 reverberated with a majestic effect in the audience hall, and signaled
 the official commencement of the festivities.
 Acoustics was one of many things not left to chance when the grandiose
 chamber was built in the time of the Founding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The crowd of guests went by in silence, ushered inside by dutiful servants
 and thick-set expressionless Protectors gathered on two opposing sides
 of the hall, leaving a wide stretch of room where the Castigator was meant
 to walk through when he would be announced.
 Indeed, the voice of the Chief Functionary boomed like a cannon in the
 night:

 wholehearted prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The workings of some kind of a large mechanism probably involving gears
 and other mechanical contraptions rang through the audience hall.
 The massive copper tinted Gates of Leor opened slowly but steadily, revealing
 the radiant form of the Castigator breathtakingly dressed in the formal
 robes of his Office: a deep crimson color dyed in the blood of heathens
 and heretics, solid golden runes written in Helica Preatoria adorning the
 hem.
 The first two pages of the Book of Law covered its surface in so fine a
 silk thread that its weavers were known to have gone blind in the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Above his robes the Castigator wore an immaculate platinum breastplate,
 without carvings, etchings or any other decoration whatsoever.
 On one side hung Urtis, the Mace of Judgment, the Castigator's long ago
 chosen tool of enlightenment and battle, that was said to have cracked
 as many heretic skulls as there are stones in the walls of the Disciplinarium.
 Indeed, some claimed the very same skulls had been used in building the
 later parts of the majestic building as a morbid reminder that All is Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Castigator strode with a steady pace down the central lane where a raised
 block of marble floor had appeared in concert with the opening of the Gates.
 The only sound in the grand chamber was the sound of the Castigator's boots:
 a simple, utilitarian set of metal plated boots a soldier would wear, finely
 polished but otherwise quite common.
 When he reached the dais on which the Seat of Office stood, he surveyed
 the crowd momentarily, sat down and clapped his bare hands once.

 Some of them even broke down weeping, pious fervor instantly occupying
 their hearts and minds.
 Those that had been blessed so before, did not immediately stand but rather
 silently prayed with tears welling in their eyes, before being able to
 stand again erect.
 The people that kept closer to the Castigator, his immediate entourage,
 the Ruling Council, and his guards intoned the holy mantra and resumed
 their places and functions.

Lord Ursempyre Remis, the Noble Representative, was seated in the council
 in order to speak on behalf of the noble families of the Outer Territories.
 His was a purely consultative role, expressing current views among the

 wealth, and status, as well as the reactions and thoughts of the nobles
 on affairs of state, religion and Law.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Even though he had no voting rights in the Council, his input was often
 quite impossible to receive otherwise and any network of informers too
 crude in comparison.
 The Castigator seemed to consider him a quite valuable asset, judging by
 the special dispensations recently appointed to House Remis.
 Likewise, Ursempyre Remis was the insightful eye and ear of the Noble houses
 concerning the inner workings of the Ministry and the Castigator, and solid
 knowledge of what went on in the Disciplinarium sometimes could buy things
 money could not.

The music that would accompany the dancing acts had started with a brass

The Patriarch noted the interest on Lord Remis face who was more than visibly
 enchanted by the dancers' performance, while the Procrastinator Militant
 had hurriedly called for his chief aide more so in order to look busy and
 industrious, rather than because actual operational planning could happen
 at such a time and place.
 The Arch-minister was indeed busy on the other hand, a trio of scribes

 stick on his left shoulder.
 He rummaged through his ever lightening knapsack for something to eat.
 With little fuss, he managed to come up with a meager meal: worrain berries
 and a piece of goat's cheese, still fresh and spongy.
 He tried to feed as much on the land as possible, keeping most of his food
 supplies for the difficult part of his journey, the Widelands themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The people in the village he went through last were the usual sort in these
 parts: animal herders mostly, and a few wheat farmers.
 Simple people that prayed solemnly to the Gods every day, wishing not for
 riches and power, lands and wives or other things that spelled vanity beyond
 their grasp.
 They wished that their child be spared of illness and harm, their herds
 be still whole come morning, the snow be light, and the rain plenty before
 harvest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
That was the sort of fools they were.
 He could feel sympathy like a man with sight feels for a man in the dark
 who has never seen golden fields in springtime and the piercing deep blue
 eyes of a young maiden, but nothing more.
 Even blind men wish for light to shine yet before their lives are ended.
 These folk just tread on, and never give things a second thought.
 He wouldn't spare them more than a passing thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His road was about to take him through the Widelands, an unforgiving place.
 Few had made the passing, and even fewer were left sane and unscathed in
 body, soul and mind once they did.
 There were stories and legends about the Widelands that were passed down
 from generation to generation, in many places and in many folk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Most of them, he had determined, were the superstitious tales of simpletons
 and madmen: mere fantasies for common people to spent the grinding, toiling
 days, thankful for their safe, ordinary, almost pitiful lives.
 Some were invariably twisted second and third-hand tales of those who had
 ventured somewhat into the accursed place and came back, surely not wholesome
 in spirit ever since.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Fact and fiction were interwoven tightly in such accounts but some probable,
 shared truths could be distilled from the broth of rumblings, mutterings,
 and assorted hearsay that permeated the inns and taverns all across the
 Territories.
 There were even a few written accounts by people who seemed to have genuinely
 made the journey and lived to tell the tale, becoming rich and famous in
 the process.
 Most of them seemed to be very talented liars and writers, the distinction
 between their works of little significance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Only the Tale of Umberth could be counted as less than nefarious, since
 he set out with a hundred-score of men, of whom barely three survived:
 Umberth, his esquire Esphalon and a woman, then only a child, who Umberth
 claimed was found wandering alone, mute and dark-skinned, almost pitch-like
 in color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Umberth had spent the rest of his days and sizable fortune trying to organize
 further trips into the Widelands.
 He made a few unsuccessful efforts to present the girl as living proof
 of his sayings of underground cities, height-defying towers and huge arching
 constructs, but the girl could not even speak her name.
 Her skin color was a singular phenomenon that more often than not provoked
 the wrath of the Ministers and the aversion of the crowds, speaking of
 heresy against the Gods and the bastard offspring of heathens and beasts
 of old that the earth unveiled from time to time to test the faithful and
 attract the blasphemer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Not long afterwards the Ministry had declared her as well as Umberth heretics,
 a relentless manhunt together with the watchful, ever pious and dutiful
 believers of the Pantheon bore fruit and Umberth and the girl were beheaded
 and their bodies burned to ashes in Pyr, in the winter of the third pacificum,
 153rd annum, 51 days before the Solstice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Esphalon, his esquire, had been sentenced to silence unto death and exiled
 never to utter a word in his life again, his tongue cut out.
 He had then wandered the northern lands, surviving on little more than
 worms and lichen, possibly wishing death for himself.
 It was while wandering the far north that he resolved to built a boat to
 travel to the End of the Ocean, and find the death he believed would free
 him of his troubled life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Strangely enough, he insisted in his work that he did build the boat, only
 to founder upon a land he had never heard of before, seemingly at first
 devoid of life.
 In those lands though he purportedly came upon a small tribe of nomads,
 wild men that knew not how to herd sheep and work with metal or clay, armed
 with wooden spears and no knowledge of fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
From what Esphalon later wrote down and described, when he was trapped and
 caught like animal prey probably destined for a savage death, be it a sacrifice
 or plain and simple cannibalism, the savages noticed while they searched
 his clothing a small hand-sized plaque of metal with no discerning characterist
ics other than a circular notch in its center, a memento from the Widelands.
 When they noticed that, Esphalon was greeted among them as an equal, a
 member of the tribe that was lost and suddenly found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He soon realized the importance of that plaque, and was further mystified.
 The savages used it to produce light and heat by placing an ordinary stone,
 even a lowly pebble, inside the notch.
 Pebbles and stones were the most widely used since they could be found
 in abundance in the northern rocky steppes were these people seemed to
 roam unhindered and unchecked.
 Sometimes they used animal bones or pieces of wood, mostly whatever was
 handy at the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Invariably, the said item slowly seemed to shrink and then vanish into thin
 air in a matter of moments, and then pleasant sunlight and radiant heat
 would emanate from the plaque for hours to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All this and much more was written in Esphalon's memoirs, a compilation
 of the things he had seen and experienced in the wild lands coupled with
 what little time he had spent with the savages.
 The plaque remained with the savage men who would not part with it in any
 way.
 Esphalon made a new boat and managed to reach an isolated fishing harbor
 facing the Pangalor Sea, half-dead from starvation and exhaustion, losing
 a leg and three fingers from frostbite in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was there where he wrote the Pangalor Scrolls, the single half-consistent
 work that contained enough about the Widelands to make it the most useful
 resource in an attempt to cross it, and perhaps uncover more about that
 mysterious land, as well as surviving long enough for others to know as
 well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His reverie was broken by the cries of a nighthawk swooping in to catch
 its prey, somewhere out in the star-lit fields of short grass and poppies
 swinging gently in the night breeze.
 He marveled at the arrogant precision and expert flying of the nighthawk
 which made no effort to catch its prey unguarded, but instead seemed to
 announce indifferently it was about to kill and then feast on a rather
 helpless and doomed animal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He smiled thinly and then got up on his feet fastening his knapsack on his
 back.
 He picked up his walking stick and set off down the marble road.
 He looked overhead and saw the nighthawk soaring triumphantly with a small
 snake writhing in its death throes, captured in the hawk's beak.
 The nighthawk cried into the night once more and then disappeared over
 the distance, its faint silhouette mingled with the starry blue and black
 sky.

 they had eaten and after Amonas conferred with Philo, the burly man said
 he would be back soon.
 Hilderich had relaxed somewhat, but he could not for the life of him fathom
 the two men.
 It might be just as well, he thought.
 He wanted to believe that when he had seen whatever it was they wanted
 to show him, perhaps they would stick true to their word and release him,
 let go of him and consider him a friend.
 The chances though, were slim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He wasn't sure exactly how a person who planned heretical plots to overthrow
 rulers of divine authority could afford to just tell people and then let
 them go and trust their good souls to tell not.
 He had a nagging feeling it involved some kind of pain and extortion, or
 simpler techniques involving knives or falling down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It just struck Hilderich as odd.
 He felt he could trust this man, but his mind reeled at the prospect.
 `I must be going slightly mad,' he thought to himself.
 He was starting to think of ways he could snatch the keystone and make
 a run for it, but the more he thought about it the more stupid he felt.
 They had already outran and outsmarted him once.
 Certainly he was no match for either one of them in single, even unarmed
 combat.
 He now belatedly wished he had taken some time to practice his body rather
 than spent most of the time knee-deep in curatoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He decided his best chances lay in playing along, seeing what it was that
 they promised would change his mind and heart forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The faint dusk had just given way to a pure, clean night.
 As he lay there in his cot, he noticed Amonas had lit a large candle and
 was reading what seemed to be letters.
 He noticed the man had been rather drawn into his reading material and
 decided against indiscretion on his part.
 Amonas through the corner of his eye though was aware of Hilderich's mild
 scrutiny and without lifting his head from his reading, he said to him
 in an inviting, conversational tone:

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas looked at him levelly, his gruff voice adding an air of authenticity
 Hilderich hadn't noticed so far.
 There was an unknown likeable quality to the man.
 Hilderich thought that perhaps he was being afflicted with a disease of
 the mind, something in the food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But he felt alright otherwise, he did not believe he was poisoned or otherwise
 tampered with.
 He just could not believe he was somehow starting to like a person who
 was either mentally deranged or emphatically dangerous, a man who confessed
 to heresy nonetheless!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich's thoughts were interrupted by Philo who entered the small room
 wearing a hood on his head.
 He nodded to Amonas, who in turn said to Hilderich:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich stood up and Amonas offered him a hooded cloak, somewhat finer
 and more elegant than most.
 As soon as he wore it, Amonas was instructing Philo to lead them on and
 out into the city.
 Amonas would be trailing, and Hilderich would be in the middle, evidently
 a small precaution on their part should he feel a sudden urge to run like
 hell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Philo lead them through somewhat shady alleys, light from far away lamps
 barely reaching them.
 They angled left and right, as if trying to evade unseen stalkers.
 Hilderich thought that perhaps they had caught whiff of someone he couldn't.
 He would not be able to see or smell anyone until it was too late in any
 case.
 So he trudged along.
 His knowledge of the city streets was perfunctory at best, but even he
 could discern that they were walking towards the Disciplinarium's hill.
 Even from a distance the sounds of music and festivities could be heard,
 and a light show of fireworks seemed to be underway as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich mused despite himself:

Amonas smiled wryly and urged him forward with a gentle nudge, while Philo
 turned his head around and stabbed Hilderich with his eyes.
 His attempt at humor had gone unanswered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The more they approached the Disciplinarium, the more careful they were
 in their approach, triple checking alleyways, hunching over shadows, their
 feet as light as cat-feet, not a sound other than shallow breathing.
 Hilderich was trying his best to follow the two men who seemed at ease
 with such practices.
 If he indeed attracted unwanted notice and they were caught, there was
 nothing to support he was an unwanting accomplice to their endeavor.
 Even if he could, he wasn't sure that would make much of a difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When they reached the base of the Disciplinarium's hill, Philo signaled
 them to stop dead in their shoes.
 He let a guard patrol vanish behind the curve of the hill's base before
 urging them to rush for a certain part of the slope, where the shadow of
 the aqueduct overhead should conceal them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They did so with a dancer's grace and reached the grassy part of the slope
 Philo had indicated.
 He took out a small knife from his belt, and Hilderich watched in still
 surprise as he dug out a small piece of tuft.
 A metal dial was to be found underneath, which then Amonas proceeded to
 twist left and right accordingly to some whim or unknown sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Without making a single sound a small tubular opening appeared above the
 dial, large enough for a man to fit inside, but only in a prone position.
 It led into a shiny metal pipe or tube of some sort with a downward inclination
 whose other end was obscured in darkness.
 Judging from the light stream of air wafting through, it was a long pipe
 indeed.

\begin_layout Standard

Philo nodded to Amonas and said:

Philo was already sliding inside the mysterious and intriguing metalwork,
 and muttered in a low voice what must have been a friendly obscenity.
 Amonas then ushered Hilderich inside, imparting a word of advice:
\end_layout

Keep your arms glued on your body.
 Count to thirty and then take a deep breath and hold it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich's terror was evident in the shrill quality of his voice.
 It had all happened too quickly to try and hold back, so when Amonas pushed
 him down the tubing he tried to follow his advice: he held his arms stiff
 to his body and started counting to thirty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The tubing angled downwards pretty soon and Hilderich felt he was riding
 a children's slide, with the slight difference that the end of the slide
 was nowhere in sight, and mad, possibly delusional, quite certainly heretic
 thugs, were shoving you down into one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich heard a splash echo dimly in the metal tubing, and was suddenly
 reminded of Amonas instruction.
 He wasn't sure if he had counted past thirty or not, but his terror and
 anxiety mixed with his confounded thoughts was a recipe against keeping
 calm and cool-headed.
 He filled his lungs with air as long as he had time anyway, and just when
 he started to think he had grievously mistimed his breath, he splashed
 into water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The feeling was one of quiet shock: the cold water encircled his whole body,
 seeping through his clothes.
 It assaulted his ears and nostrils, as it tried to enter his body without
 warning.
 His eyes had closed instinctively but then he opened them slowly, searching
 for the surface.
 His hands wobbled uncertainly, before a small primal fear of running out
 of air urged him to swim upwards, towards what seemed to be a faint source
 of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Within moments his head was clear of the water.
 He exhaled momentarily, then breathed in gasps until he could return to
 breathing normally once more.
 An outstretched hand seemed to be offering to help him out of the water.
 As soon as he realized it belonged to Philo he heard another splash of
 water roughly behind him, and turned his head to look even as Philo pulled
 him to somewhat dry land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was Amonas who as if he were intimately accustomed to the area needed
 no help and within seconds was among them, tiny rivulets of water still
 running down his leather vest, thick drops falling from his forehead.
\end_layout

Let us move.
 Hilderich, I would beg your silence.

, said Hilderich while vainly trying to squeeze off some of the water in
 his clothes.
 Amonas responded promptly:

We are.
 But we still have some way to go.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had fallen inside a natural cistern in a small rocky cave.
 Strangely enough, light seemed to seep through some cracks in the walls.
 With a closer inspection, Hilderich saw the cracks were more akin to lichen,
 faintly wet to the touch but rough like rocky sand.
 A sort of crystal formation seemed to lie underneath such spots.
 Philo nudged him onward, cutting his examination of the peculiarity short.
 It reminded him of some lesser kind of curatoria that his master was not
 particularly interested in, and thus were only lightly studied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But the light they gave off was indeed enough, even though only barely,
 to walk the gently curving twists and turns of what seemed to be an extensive
 network of caves, an almost ant-like structure deep underneath the Disciplinari
um's hill.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He noticed the steady, purposeful stride of Amonas before him and the dim
 blue and violet light that imparted a grim hue on everything around, including
 themselves.
 A feeling of eerie wariness started to seep in Hilderich.
 After some time had passed, he tapped Amonas shoulder, who paused in his
 gait to turn and look directly at Hilderich, a look of expectancy on his
 face but not a sound coming out of his lips.
 Hilderich asked in a low voice:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Are we lost?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas did not answer but rather resumed his walk, taking them through caverns
 small and large through a path that could not be retraced unless one had
 a detailed map.
 The further down they went, the warmer it felt and soon walking in the
 caves felt like a warm summer night.
 Hilderich had by now lost track of their approximate depth, direction,
 or distance of travel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps they were not lost but he essentially was and thought he would be
 unable to find the way back on his own if the opportunity ever presented
 itself.
 On a second reflection though, Hilderich thought it would be of little
 importance, since the tube was meant to go down and not up.
 Just as he let out a sigh of hopelessness, he could discern light pouring
 out from the next corner and feel their slight descend leveling out.
 By now his clothes felt almost dry with only a slight feeling of dampness
 remaining in his feet and arms.
 If anything at all, it was an improvement in the state of his affairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The light grew more intense, clear like sunlight.
 Hilderich knew it was impossible to find sunlight so deep under the earth,
 especially at night.
 They were only a few paces away from a corner in their path that shone
 with light.
 Amonas threw up one arm with his palm open, indicating a halt, and Hilderich
 followed Philo's example and stopped.
 Amonas leaned over the corner, and peered carefully for almost a minute.
 Hilderich assumed he was making sure it was safe for them to enter, though
 he doubted there was the possibility of a real threat against them in such
 a system of caves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas nodded to indicate that everything seemed as it should be, and walked
 out into the light pouring from around the corner.
 He blinked, his eyes flinching as they adjusted to the brightness and then
 gestured with his hand to Hilderich before he said:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich stepped forward as well, the bright light forcing him to instinctively
 cover his eyes with his right arm, its small shadow the only shelter against
 such sudden illumination.
 A fragrant waft of air rushed around them, and as Philo joined them as
 well all three of them were slowly walking towards the light.
 As Hilderich's eyes finally adjusted to the light, he could see the rocky
 cave all around them give way to a smooth white surface that at first glance
 seemed much like porcelain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
These strange walls seemed to extrude themselves from the strata of the
 cave rocks, as if totally alien and utterly old in origin.
 Then Hilderich's eyes wandered a bit more, his gaze resting on the center
 of a huge chamber apparently made from the same ivory white material.
 The chamber was cylindrical in shape.
 From top to bottom stood a wide pillar which incredulously seemed to be
 made of pure light, a view that defied Hilderich's sense of sight and filled
 him with astonishment.

\begin_layout Standard

 Amonas said while edging closer to the pillar.
 Hilderich stood a couple of steps behind him with his face brightly illuminated
, but his eyes unflinching.
 Philo stood at the rocky entrance to the chamber, with his back indifferently
 turned to the wondrous sight in front of their eyes.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was visibly shaken as if coming around from a waking dream, eyes
 rolling around trying to come to grips with his surroundings and the man
 with the gruff voice in front of him was shouting at him, as if he was
 ready to snap him in two if he said the wrong thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He asked him to think of the Mythos, and the Law.
 The Law was the established religious canon that had replaced traditional
 secular law hundreds of years earlier.
 The Mythos was the recorded history of the Gods handing down the Law unto
 the forsaken race of man, to save it from destruction and withering, to
 help men reach their Gods at the Time of Conjugation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Law instructs man that those the people knew as Ancients were the manifestat
ion of evil.
 That any tool or work of art or science whose workings cannot be seen with
 the naked eye or touched by naked hand are containers of evil.
 That there is only this land, and none other.
 That the lights in the sky were put there by the Gods, to make nights more
 bearable.
 That death is irrevocable and permanent and those who do not uphold the
 Law, will be shunt forever, their souls kept away from the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
That any man, woman or child upholding belief in the Ancients or their works
 is a heretic, a vessel of corruption.
 That the Ministers, uphold and teach the Law to the people.
 That the people in turn, devote themselves and their lives to obey the
 Law.
 That the Patriarch declares additional Law as he sees fit, and he alone
 chooses his successor.
 That a Castigator rules above all: a man of wisdom and strength to lead
 the people, protect them; enlighten the heathens, punish the lawbreakers
 and the heretics, and offer praise and glory to the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
That is what the Mythos and the Law say.
 Hilderich, though he did not consider himself the religious type, had always
 been careful not to attract the ire of the Ministers.
 He had memorized the Mythos and the Law as part of his training and education,

Hilderich was considering the magnificent simplicity and awesome sight of
 the pillar of light in front of him.
 It was a bright pillar of sunlight not as blinding as the suns though,
 with a hazy rainbow of all colors on its edges, and a pulsating haze of
 tiny pin pricks rushing through some sort of invisible shell.
 He was interrupted somewhat violently by Amonas who neatly but decisively
 pushed him towards the pillar of light.

 He saw an explosion of light, swirling walls of light running up to meet
 him face on.
 Nothingness ensued for what must have been less than a heartbeat.
 Light filled his senses totally, even his smell.
 He could have sworn he could smell the light.
 His eyes seemed to adjust to the radiant sea of white enfolding him, and

A man with no purpose in life is like a river without a sea to lose itself
 in.
 Such is the meaning of purpose, hard and defining: to lose oneself completely
 in its threads.
 Immerse one's essence in a journey with no visible end in the distance.
 Anything less is bound to bring about ennui, the crushing realization of
 our discrete physical form and its inadequacies.
 Anything less than steering oneself through life like the only real obstacle
 is death itself, leads to early death of the mind and the soul.
 I ask you, would you live life or stand by idly waiting for death? I choose
 to vanquish death altogether.

 mountain grew ever more unkind.
 Its many bare faces looked down upon a lonely figure, slowly but surely
 making its way through the rocks, gravel, low grass and loose dirt.
 His hood was down, revealing a stern but humble face.
 Care lines dotted his forehead, and one could easily spot he was not a
 man prone to laughing easily.
 His face was adorned by a beard grown out of necessity, not choice, and
 his thin long hair was unkempt; a few wild strands jutted in strange directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The wind and the rain were thankfully absent on this day, awarding him the
 leisure of trudging along the mountainous path with only his sore feet
 and stiff legs to distract him from his effort.
 Indeed, he paused once again to rest for a moment and let his blood flow
 freely in his legs and feet; take a moment to pray to God for his good
 fortunes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He sat down on the naked rock, his buttocks well used to such discomforts.
 He touched his forehead with one had and brought out a small piece of knotted

 His lips then moved in a silent orison, asking for more of the same good
 fortune and perhaps a bush or nut-bearing tree from which to gather some
 much needed food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

He had not seen or heard signs of goats or other mountain-dwelling animals
 for days now.
 There was still some grass on these slopes, so it stood to reason there

 Perhaps there were richer plains and slopes far below or plateaus with
 good grass his path had not taken him through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Maybe it was pure chance that he had not seen a living soul, neither a bird

He was living on certain kinds of insects that were still to be found if
 someone knew how and where to look, and a few roots he had been able to
 identify as edible.
 The further deep inside the mountain range he trod, the stranger and more
 different the life he met became.
 At first the trees started to become bulky, water rich, taller and greener
 than the ones at the feet of the mountain.
 Then he noticed the animals: they were more stout and fatter; their meat
 sweet and richer in flavor, its color a vivid red.
 It was unlike the dark, stringy meat of the animals he was used to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He decided in his mind that it was a sign: With his every step closer to
 God's Lands, the land was graced by his favor.
 The animals became fat and felt no hunger, the trees and plants grew tall
 and proud, the birds soared high and their voices were sweet as honeydew
 running down a child's mouth.
 It was His work all that was abundant, and all that was good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
This part of the mountains seemed to have fallen from His grace though,
 whether as another trial or for reasons only He could entertain.
 No matter; since His wisdom permeates the earth and the sky, the Pilgrim
 felt he could only accept and never wonder.
 That way lay madness, and a hard fall from grace into bottomless pits of
 despair and unworthiness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He felt he was attuned, his soul resonating with the earth below his feet,
 the sky above and the stone all around him.
 He reached into his small sack and with little effort produced a small
 circular pendant, a thin slice of white marble or porcelain cast around
 a black mat surface, smooth and cold to the touch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He held it firmly with both hands for a while looking intently at its black
 surface.
 A thin sliver of green started to pulsate on the black surface.
 A green line started to form in one edge of the small black circlet to
 end on another, forming a straight path.
 It was like the invisible brush of a painter kept stroking the same line,
 always in the same straight direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He looked at the thin, green line of light and then looked at the faint
 mountain path that made a zig-zag through the ever rockier slopes.
 His path was true, that much he knew.
 His pointing stone had not failed him before and neither would it fail
 him now, not on his Pilgrimage; not while his faith was strong and his
 prayer warm of heart and soul.
 That he knew, and little else would come to matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He took a moment to gaze at the lands resting below him.
 The great northern plains could be seen far away, a faint gray haze slightly
 discernible under a thin sheet of fog.
 And then rolling hills of auburn slowly lifting off the ground as if the
 very hand of God had touched and pinched the lands, his hand print faintly
 echoed in the timid, graceful slopes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Between the foot of the mountains and the hills lay a deep gorge with a
 wild river running through it, twisting and turning as far as the eye could
 see further to the east.
 Its flow came from somewhere deep inside the mountains, further to the
 east, from places where the ice moves as if alive and the suns always hide
 behind the clouds.
 Places where neither man nor beast can endure for long without the mercies
 of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A sensation of wonder filled him, for the works of God were magnificent
 to behold, and his Pilgrimage a unique journey of faith, beauty, wonder
 and duty.
 The honor he was blessed with was indeed so great he could have never thought
 it possible, much less aspire to be given it.
 Nonetheless, he was on a Pilgrimage to the Land of God.
 He was the Pilgrim, the one honored to pay homage to the Land of God and
 the resting place of their forefathers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
To him lay the duty of bringing back a Holy Forge, to pluck one out of the
 very famed Garden of Wonders! His eyes were suddenly lit at the very thought,
 even as his body still dully ached from the many hardships his peregrination
 had knowingly brought upon him and would bring him still.
 But he ignored all that which occluded his mind and he imagined himself,
 standing amidst the Garden of Wonders and quenching his thirst from the
 Unending Spring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It would all be more than worthy of the pain, the cold and the rain.
 Just to lay his eyes on the Holy Gates, he would willingly give his life.
 But he could not and would not, until his Pilgrimage was complete, and
 his people had their Holy Forge anew.
 Oh, the joyous wonders he had yet to behold, not just the earth and the
 rivers and the mountains all wrought in unquestioned wisdom, but the craft
 of God Himself right in front of his eyes, at the touch of his hand from
 silver, and stone.
 From sand that never crumbles or faints, and never shall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim's senses brought him back to the cold, harsh reality.
 He still had some good light left and he should not waste it.
 His journey was still many days and nights away from an end.
 Tarrying here in the middle of the mountains, daydreaming like a young
 selfish brat was not at all what any man would expect of him, the one so
 honored.
 His shoulders suddenly felt a bit heavier with so much resting on them:
 the future of his people, the life of the land, the children yet unborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A gust of the mountains' cold and wholesome air seemed to have infected
 him with renewed vigor.
 Within seconds he was already steadily climbing up the steep winding path
 that would take him between the two dominant mountain peaks, and afterwards
 probably on a shallow descend to the Land of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Those who had gone before him had followed the same path, and had passed
 on word of their travels and their journey.
 What mountains and ridges to pass, which rivers and springs to drink from,
 what strange growths and roots to eat, where to feel safe and sleep unhindered,
 as well as where to always keep one eye open and your knife in hand.

He thought to himself then: `But God provides, and always will.
 As long as we have faith, as long as we live our lives like we were meant
 to, taught to from father to child, as long as we go on the Pilgrimage
 when time and God mandate.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Such thoughts occupied his head as he toiled onwards, even though under
 his thick pelted boots his calloused feet could feel every last jut of
 rock and bit of gravel.
 This was him now, this described him wholly.
 He was the Pilgrim, meant to walk the earth until he reached the Holy Place.
 Whether or not he would go back to his people and his previous life, that
 meant nothing.
 When he performed the Rites, the Holy Forge would be with his people.
 And then he could walk back, and live the rest of his days having witnessed
 the glory of God.
 He could then teach those that would come after him and if fate would have
 it so, help the next Pilgrim prepare for his own difficult journey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
`Perhaps,' he thought to himself, `I am getting too far ahead in my thinking.
 My journey is still far from over, and yet here I am: my feet dead as wood,
 my legs heavy like rock, once again on the climb.
 All I've loved and known left behind perhaps forever, and I am letting
 myself be fooled by visions of a future yet to unravel, with me at its
 center.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Selfishness.
 Ego.
 A sign of malignancy, a precursor to evil thoughts and desires, accursed
 manifestations of Them.
 He prayed then to God, to watch over his people and lend him strength and
 clarity of mind and purpose.
 To think such thoughts was almost irredeemable.
 God was already pointing to the true path, when everything so far had proceeded
 along according to his divine plan, when the auguries had said it was a
 good time for a Pilgrimage.
 That he was a good man, that he would be a true Pilgrim, one that God would
 accept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He felt he had to cleanse himself with birch and water, pay obeisance to
 his God with an offer of personal sacrifice.
 But he was already on his Pilgrimage, what could he do now that would not
 interfere with his holy purpose? He had no inkling yet, but he felt blood
 rushing through his veins, feeling guilty and shameful, almost soiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He pushed harder, the slope turning into an almost sheer wall of rock.
 The small, narrow path had degenerated into a granite crevice with pockmarks
 and surfaces of chipped rock that one had to climb using his hands as well
 as his feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In his mind it mattered little, because he felt like he would grow wings
 if he had to, if somehow the earth was without warning removed from his
 feet.
 He felt like he would grow gills and scales, and swim the oceans of the
 world if the skies suddenly opened and poured all the water of the world
 and the earth was covered in it.
 He felt that nothing, save God himself, could stop him now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He steadily put one hand after the next, hoisting his lithe and supple careworn
 body slowly but surely, every step of the way a small death for Them.
 A death to their venomous influence that seeps into the hearts and minds
 of the weak-minded and the unfaithful, that spreads over the people of
 the earth like a rotting disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perspiration glistened on his forehead and the small of his back was damp
 as well.
 Every muscle and joint burned from the effort and protested at his every
 leap and move.
 But he kept going, his mind focused; his soul was shielded and armed like
 a searing force of pure light stabbing through a heart of darkness, a pestilenc
e of lies, deceit and wrong-doing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was fighting Them even as he climbed, even as he sweat and toiled.
 His whole Pilgrimage was a Holy War he now knew, and this very climb a
 fight, a battle.
 Like the War between God and Them, at a time before man.
 The same war; a million fights and a million more until God prevails, until
 the faithful have had their share of blood and toil.
 Until then he would climb for his people, His Faithful.
 Until then he would endure the forces arrayed against him, be they nature,
 men, or Them, in one disguise or many.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would endure and he would prevail.
 Not to become a revered one among his folk, not to serve some delusional
 idea of a grandiose self in a small world and an even smaller land, among
 its few people.
 It was true; their numbers were dwindling and their women bore less children
 as time went by.
 Their lives were becoming shorter.
 The Pilgrimage was their hope of survival, he knew.
 He would endure the hardships of his path and the machinations of the enemies
 of God, for the good of his people and the will of his God.

He tried to find a handhold in the rocks, a fissure, a jutting piece of
 granite or lime, but all he could grasp was the thin, cold rush of air.
 He made a leap and his face was caught in the stream of air: his hood fluttered
 wildly about his neck, sweaty locks of hair caressing his face.
 He had reached the neck between the two peaks, and he could now see a wide
 stretch of plain-like ground extending before him.
 There lay before him grim patches of grass, rocks and dusty gravel for
 days worth of travel.

He could feel the touch of God as he took the final step onto the plateau.

 He remembered then the words of his Guide, his people's master of lore

Indeed then his path was true; the first of many perils he had just left

 He let out a laugh in spite of him, a laugh he would soon look down upon
 with contempt as it bordered blasphemy.
 But it was a laugh that welled from the soul, a liberating act; a cry of
 thanks to his God and his protector, his ever watchful Father.
 He started walking with a steady, slow pace once more.
 What little light of day remained guided him to a cluster of rocks where
 he might find shelter for the coming night.
 Once he lay down, he would pray to God and offer him his gratitude for
 saving him from disgrace and keeping him on the true path.

 Her long golden brown hair tangled as it was from last night's fretful

But that was only a fleeting impression, for when she touched her belly
 and felt her unborn child still soundly and safely asleep, her smile was
 like heavenly orchards that grew and bore ripe honey-sweet fruit in the
 blink of an eye.
 It was as if all the goodness in creation had come together in a still
 moment of time; a mother's smile, a power beyond reckoning and imagination,
 all that in the creases of a beautiful face and two comely lips.
 She who had seemed as a terrible force had been wondrously transfigured
 into a mother bathed in sunlight, radiating warmth and love; all hints
 of terrible awe a mere phantom now in the eye of the beholder.

After a few moments of silent contemplation as if communicating with the

 Celia then threw her sheets away playfully and got out of bed to follow
 her usual routine: she took her morning bath and then offered her own prayer
 to her own Gods, thanking them for sending a man like Amonas to her, for
 the conception of their child.
 She also prayed for her husband's safe return and her child's first cry
 unto this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

She was then startlingly taken by the fragrant smell that had gently occupied
 her senses ever since she opened her eyes.
 She felt almost strange for not immediately taking notice of such a beautiful
 scent.
 With a familiar way she tried to trace the source of the strong, tasteful
 smell that seemed to seep through the walls and pour from balconies and
 windows.
 She peered over her stone balcony and saw that more and more people were
 starting to wade through the streets, the day ticking on in its usual rhythm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

She then spent her morning as was her usual routine nowdays: brooming and
 cleaning the house as much as her straining back allowed.
 Most of her time though she spent knitting clothes for her unborn child:
 winter clothes and baby gowns, blankets as well as a lenarion for Amonas.
 But her mind ever so often wandered to him, and when he would come knocking
 at their door again.
 She put her mind at ease knowing he had Philo with him, whatever they were
 doing.

Time flew by like birds in the spring.
 When she had felt tired once more, evening had beckoned.
 She was surprised that she hadn't felt any hunger, but her appetite was
 strange for a pregnant woman, she had known.
 Sometimes she could not stop eating whatever came to hand, and other times
 hours went by without a single bite of food.
 She decided to bring firewood from their small cellar and paused for a
 while before starting a fire anew for the day's meal.
 She mused about making some stew or perhaps a broth of beans and greens.

The city crowd on the streets was shifting towards its nocturnal aspect,
 the people that rarely venture outside if the suns still abound and rarely
 crawl back to their domiciles before dawn is about to break.
 The Watchday would be over as soon as the suns set and the Merrynight would
 hold until tomorrow.
 Loud song and cheers, sounds of merrymaking and laughter could be heard
 at least once in every street that she passed on her way to Ves, a farmer
 that was her distant kin, a cousin in fact, and did not try to fool her
 like most others in the market did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

She wasn't sure if she would make it in time for at that hour Ves as well
 as almost everyone else with farms or animals to tend, had to leave for
 his farmstead to eat and rest.
 In the morning he would be getting up in the middle of the night to water
 whichever plants were in need, and then he would harvest those ready for
 the market.
 Then he would load up his cart and off he would be to the market once more
 to make some coin for his wife and children, so they'd not have to beg
 like some people who were cast adrift in the unfathomable torrents of fortune.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

She could see those people: disheveled beings, sometimes indistinguishable

 Some of them brought a sore tear to her eyes.
 A few she helped as she could, a loaf of bread or her daily bottle of milk

 Sometimes she would leave a plate of food for those that drifted throughout
 the city and did not just await their end at some dark corner of the market.

As she turned the last corner before she reached Ves' usual stand, she could
 see she was too late: Ves as well as everyone else in the same spot had
 left for the night, leftover fruit and vegetable stalks amassing on the
 cobbled streets and a sour acrid odor wafting all around her.
 If nothing else at all, she had indeed taken a walk though at an inappropriate
 hour, and felt she should be getting home before long.

As she turned around to start walking back towards her house, she froze

 else she would be already lying in a pool of her own blood for what little
 coin she carried in her tiny purse.
 She shuddered at the thought that worse things than an untimely death could
 have happened to her that she dared not imagine while carrying her child
 still in her womb.
 The figure spoke to her in a curt, hushed voice:

\lang english
Hilderich was picking ineffectually at the withering bark of a large oak-like
 tree.
 The tree was slowly turning into ash, returning into the dirt one very
 small piece at a time.
 Hilderich was quite fascinated by what he was seeing all around him and
 that was probably why he had not broken down in hysterical cries since
 their mishap.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Which was also why he could blame Amonas for their predicament in a steady,
 calm, and somewhat detached distant tone of voice.
 Half his mind was infuriated close to bursting, because Amonas seemed to
 have had inadvertently stranded them 
\shape slanted
somewhere.
 
\shape default
The other half of his mind was trying to make connections between the flora
 and fauna of the place they had found themselves in, and the various curatoria
 he believed he could remember having some kind of relation in part or in
 whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Indirectly this was Hilderich's way of coping with the problem in hand,
 partly to offset his mind and unburden it from the stress and the anxiety
 as well as what he had learned to consider generally counter-productive
 emotions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
On top of that he was actually trying to help in his own lateral way by
 trying to identify anything he might be able to.
 His efforts were based on the various curatoria he had studied or seen
 in his unfortunately short and, recent events not withstanding, uneventful
 apprenticeship.
 It seemed that apart from superficial resemblances and some generic common
 traits, he had arrived at no particularly useful conclusion.
 `For the time being,' he reminded himself silently and thoughtfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas was sitting at a partly exposed root of a gigantic tree he had trouble
 accepting that was real even though he had been sitting right there on
 the same spot for the better part of an hour in silent and thoughtful perplexit
y.
 Hilderich had spared little of the last hour trying to talk to Amonas,
 or simply take notice of the man's face.
 If he had, it would have been enough for even the most socially inept,
 slow-witted and sentimentally detached human to understand that Amonas
 was deeply troubled.
 In fact he looked morose, and it was not without good cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Insects abounded in this humid environment, the likes of which he had not
 known existed, not even in the southernmost bogs and marshes.
 Sweat poured from their bodies incessantly, making their every movement
 a sticky, messy business.
 It was the heat that really got to them.
 The heat of the desert combined with the the moisture of a lake or river.
 It was as if steam rose from the earth in a constant, endless motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had seen no river whatsoever from the top of the hill where they had
 emerged, and had come upon no body of water in their blind search so far.
 The humidity and heat of the place was overwhelming though; Amonas had
 expressed the sound opinion that they should devote most of their time
 and effort into simply staying alive for the time being.
 He had objectified that into finding a source of clean, fresh water, preferably
 before nightfall.
 Water was not the only thing that occupied his mind though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It buzzed incessantly with the same recurring thought; that all this was
 indeed his fault, and Hilderich had been right to accuse him.
 His initial purpose when pushing Hilderich into that infernal pillar of
 light, a machinery truly made in its makers image, was to force him to
 see the truth.
 It had not gone as planned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The first time he himself had stepped through that beacon of light, he vividly
 remembered how he had been instantly transferred into a huge, deep cavern
 with walls of solid metal jutting out of the bedrock.
 He had wandered through a meandering labyrinth of large metal pipes, interconne
ctions and all manners of weird machinery and constructs the likes of which
 he could not believe were made by mere men.
 They had to be the work of beings akin to Gods or their dutiful servants.
 The scenery around him was indeed as if it had been wrought out of the
 Mythos itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had seen words in Helican Pretoria he had not seen before dangling in
 the air around him as if they had been stamped with a thick ink of light
 on a giant spider's gossamer web.
 He had seen visions of gruesome death, savagery and bloody toil, endlessly
 replayed as if it all was a theatrical stage, and he was the sole viewer.
 He had seen the likes of the Patriarch and the Castigator conspiring against
 the people, orchestrating deaths and mass executions as if people's lives
 were mere numbers on charts, maps and reports.
 And he had seen the Patriarch vanish and reappear, wielding strange instruments
 of unknown origin that would have been deemed utterly blasphemous.
 Instead, he had wielded them like tools intimately known and regularly
 used.
 Apart from dangerous and cunning wolves he knew them to be, he saw the
 extend of their lies and deceit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had seen many things he could not fathom and explain.
 He had needed Hilderich to do that for him.
 Uncover some idea of the workings behind all that, perhaps use something
 against the Patriarch and the Castigator.
 He had seen so much more he needed to forget as well but could not, in
 fact dared not forget, lest the hatred for their jailers and captors, those
 madmen, would diminish ever so imperceptibly.
 He found out he lacked the words to describe the sickening mob of rulers
 who moved freely about like a sickle does unto stalks of wheat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
No such euphemism like dictator or killer would really suffice to describe
 them completely.
 He felt like he would have to leave that to someone else, since in the
 end he might not be able to slit their throats in person as he would have
 liked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Without knowing he seemed to have been gripping his knife from its blade
 so intensely that he had cut himself: a small rivulet of blood and sweat
 ran down his wrist, droplets of rosy red falling down onto the constantly
 wet ground.
 Ever thirsty and never quenched, be it blood, water or both, these new
 lands seemed to feed on a man's desperation and sweat.
 His focus returned to the immediate reality around them and felt the sagging
 weight of the situation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had to have faith in himself, he knew.
 He was a man of action and he had already decided to forfeit his life if
 it came to that.
 Others were capable of carrying out the same mission as he was supposed
 to.
 If he could not do so in the end, he only felt it was wrong for Celia and
 their unborn child.
 What would happen to them, if he were to perish?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She was strong of mind and will, that much he knew and was one of the many
 reasons he loved her so.
 But he could not so easily cast her adrift without a second thought; she
 had suffered such impropriety in her life already.
 He wouldn't be a man if he did not take her and their child into account.
 What misguided sense of duty could overcome his true purpose? A world and
 a future free of slaves in body and mind.
 No, he would not die in this place, he set his mind against that.
 He had a mission to do and a family to return to.
 He decided that all his thoughts from now on would form around these two
 things, and he'd cast out each shadow of a doubt like a drunkard from a
 barracks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He looked up to the alien looking sky, so familiar but so different at the
 same time.
 He could remember his days of ignorance and blissful youth riding in the
 countryside, galloping fast and hard as if the world's end was rushing
 right behind him.
 The sky had a strange quality: a light blur or a haze of wonder.
 It looked as if it was merely a ceiling he could reach up and touch as
 long as he wished it hard enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would keep his promises and find his way back, to make things right.
 He would free his fellow men.
 He would live his life anew, reborn, fresh and innocent as his firstborn

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He thought then that he had tarried on the matter for too long.
 It was time to act: they would secure any means of survival in this strange
 land and acclimatise themselves quickly.
 No one could know how long their journey back would take.
 They were completely lost, but he knew that nothing important ever happened
 on its own.
 They would have to have faith in themselves and their purpose, and anything
 would be possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas thought to himself that it was Hilderich's purpose as well.
 He knew though that Hilderich could not have grasped the extend of the
 lies, deceit, and exploitation.
 His instincts and experience told him that he should be able to put Hilderich
 to some good use as well; the man who was a little older than a mere boy
 seemed to have some good qualities: he was smart and perceptive, suspicious
 but not predisposed, simple but not simple-minded.
 Amonas believed that Hilderich would do fine, that they would be fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There were some issues that defied explanations though and would probably
 be denied of one for a long time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The suns seemed wrong, for starters, and that certainly said a lot about
 the grievousness of their situation.
 They appeared brighter than usual and smaller, the hue of its light a pale
 blue, as if a sickness had befallen it.
 That was what had caught their eye in the sky.
 But then there were the towers, or spirals, he wasn't sure how to describe
 them from all that distance.
 They seemed to be tall towers with double spires that seemed to form a
 roughly crescent shape, their base lost behind the thick foliage of the
 ever-present trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There seemed to be dozens of these huge constructs in regular intervals,
 as if an architect blessed with godly sight had deemed to place them all
 over the landscape which in itself was another peculiarity: as far as the
 eye could see the horizon was covered in shades of greenery, spotted in
 parts by yellow and red patches.
 It was as if there was nothing else to be found in these lands other than
 this hot and humid garden and its strange awe-inspiring structures.
 They sort of reminded him of giant bullhorns, if he had to describe them
 more plainly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had thought about broaching all these matters to Hilderich, but he decided
 against that for now.
 The detailed intricacies of their whereabouts, their actual location, the
 climate and topography of the region were merely academic issues if they
 could not provide them with a small shred of actual information that would
 lead them to somehow going back to Pyr, or any other recognizable place
 for that matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was still absorbed in thought, his eyes piercing the tall canopy of thick
 foliage.
 The huge volume of the surrounding trees stood like rocky pillars between
 the sky and the ground.
 He was marvelling at their size when Hilderich literally slapped him back
 into the real world and felt his wet and sticky palm, his left cheek flushed
 red from the hit:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was shouting now, still thinking Amonas was day-dreaming or far
 worse, had finally lost his fragile mind.
 As he swung his hand back once more to deliver another slap, Amonas turned
 his head ever so lightly and looked him straight in the eye and simply
 said:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was genuinely surprised at such an ambivalent behavior.
 Had Amonas been catatonic he would never have responded and then he would
 have been left alone.
 With his survival skills and his latest round of luck, Hilderich was certain
 that he would have perished in this steamy cauldron.
 If Amonas was indeed mad, he would have probably gone berserk and snapped
 his neck like a twig in the best case scenario.
 It seemed now that he was neither.
 He had been simply, as strange as it seemed to Hilderich at the time, hard
 at thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He sat down in front of Amonas on the leaf strewn ground which was wet and
 muddy.
 A continuous hint of rotting vegetation waxed and waned in the faint wisps
 of air, a fitting reminder of what happens to idle life.
 Hilderich cleared his throat, toying around with a small branch, shooting
 idle looks at the ground before his feet.
 He asked with some reluctance:

Amonas bit his lip and outstretched his hands, an ornate ring of silver

 to say otherwise before nodding in acceptance and telling Hilderich:

It's real Hilderich.
 That is what has dragged me down in thought.
 I am sorry Hilderich, my intentions were quite different, and certainly
 did not involve both of us getting utterly lost, especially at such a moment
 in time.
 I know I have failed you so far Hilderich, so I will promise you nothing.
 I can only offer you my help in order to find a way home.
 We need to work on this together, whatever you might think of me so far.
 It was my fault, but I cannot undo it alone.

A bitter smile formed on his lips, and his head turned to look once more
 at the thick foliage, hoping to catch a glimpse of the strangely immaculate,
 perfectly cloudless sky.

When Amonas looked down again, he noticed Hilderich had fallen on his back
 giggling almost maniacally with his knees bent haplessly in a comical angle
 and his arms folded across his chest, clapping his hands vibrantly.
 Amonas face frowned quizzically.
 Hilderich's bizarre reaction to his statement had left him unable to understand
 or much less respond at all.

 Suddenly his visage turned harsh and unforgiving, out of place with his

All that Amonas could do, was blink wide-eyed at a loss for words.

 just announced the end of the world.

Hilderich, I'm sure we'll have quite some time to exchange tales and ideas.
 But we have to attend to our survival first.
 We will need fresh, drinking water.
 Something solid to eat, surely.
 Something that will not easily spoil in this heat and moisture.
 But our priority should be water.
 At the rate we sweat, we will surely suffer the most without it.
 And too soon for comfort, I would wager.
 And another thing I only now noticed.

Hilderich nodded, and then looked carefully around them at the barks of
 trees and small rocks and hanging green overgrowths.
 He looked at what one would call a glen if it weren't for the awfully wrong
 conditions and the green overarching roof made from ostensibly ancient
 tree branches.
 The canopy was a mosaic of green and brown hues, the greenish light of
 the sun adding an emerald glare to the columns of light that shot underneath
 where Hilderich could see the shadows standing still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Indeed he noticed that the shadows had moved little or not at all since
 earlier.
 He couldn't be sure, but he knew it was at least strange and probably another

The shadows during the day are cast because of the suns' light.
 So, when the suns move across the sky, so do the shadows follow in hand

 Would the suns stay still, so would the shadows.
 It is not entirely without logic to postulate that since we have witnessed
 only one sun, this is perhaps the reason for its inability to move, and
 hence the standing shadows and the continuous light.

Hilderich was seemingly more humorous than before, his words clearly not
 to be taken for granted, but Amonas had to admit the fact that this strange
 sun and taxing climate would make their efforts even more strained and
 difficult than he had calculated.
 And still he feared, they had no solid idea of how to get back home.
 Survival would have to take precedence.
 That meant finding water, not sooner or later, but immediately.
 They had spoken enough of the matter.

Under different circumstances that would have involved my absence, I would

A few hours later, Amonas had ground their way through an ever thickening
 vegetation.
 He was now stripped naked to the waist, the heat and humidity insufferable
 to bear with his leather vest and chain mail underneath.
 Hilderich wondered at how the man had suffered to carry all that weight
 at all, never mind wearing all that in such conditions.
 It was a curiosity that he had only chosen to take off most of it only
 after they had been walking for the better part of an hour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It seemed to Hilderich as if the man had grown literally attached to his
 set of armor, or that its prolonged use had left indelible stains on his
 body.
 None of those reasons it seemed, could withstand even light scrutiny.
 Amonas had answered when questioned that he had simply not taken them off
 because he hadn't felt inclined to.
 Hilderich thought that spoke volumes for the man's tolerance threshold,
 and what he was capable of going through if pressed hard enough.
 Hilderich knew he had no desire to learn of Amonas' limits though.
 He believed this whole experience would be if nothing else, sufficiently
 educational and vividly remembered if they did make it back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas seemed to be indefatigable.
 He had trod on through thickset lush overgrowths, greens and all sorts
 of wild vegetation using his indispensable knife and had neither complained
 for the steaming heat nor for the breath-clogging moisture.
 Hilderich had refrained from asking questions about the reasoning behind
 their apparently random course through this probably impossible to map
 land, which lacked easily identifiable characteristics to use as points
 of reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Except those towers that looked like bullhorns, or `giant forks' as Hilderich
 had described them.
 Naming was of little importance and would probably do them little justice
 as well.
 Such majestic structures in the middle of this chaotic spread of plants
 was indeed a humbling sight.
 They were roughly headed towards the general direction of one of those
 structures.
 Structures that mere men could not have possibly wrought.

Hilderich felt Amonas was not unreasonably excited about his finding, but
 he could not readily share the joy.
 His legs though he did not complain about it felt heavy and pained him,
 while his feet were a soggy, uncomfortably wet affair.
 His light boots had let all the moisture inside and their path had guided
 him through many mud-soaked footings.
 He could feel his skin was not up to the task and looked miserable to the
 bone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Still, finding water was the first good thing that had happened ever since
 that fine uwe stew.
 To Hilderich the previous day seemed now like another age altogether.
 He managed a defiant smile which he hoped Amonas would not take too seriously,
 and carried himself to the small trickling water source where Amonas was
 washing his face:

, Hilderich said jokingly and cupped his hands under the small trickle of
 water running down through an old tree's bark.
 It looked almost as if someone had fashioned it specifically for that purpose.
 Their luck hadn't run dry just yet, it would seem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
After they managed to wash away some of the sweat and grit and more importantly
 quench their thirst and fill their belly with more water than it could
 handle, Amonas took Hilderich by the arm and suggested to him that they
 should try and make some sort of camp there, near the water.
 The rain would be coming, he had said, even with the clear sky above, since
 there can be no water with no rain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas insisted they would have to keep dry, since that was how many folk
 in the sea died.
 He explained that their bodies were usually found almost dried out, nothing
 but dessicated husks.
 From what he knew, it was because water was attracted to water and the
 water in the body, the blood, the piss, the spit, was drawn away to the
 sea.
 The rich got richer even in nature, perhaps even in this weird land as
 well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In any case, he had convinced Hilderich that it was wiser to stay dry, and
 it would indeed be a welcome change in any case.
 They would have to build a fire to do that and with all that humidity everywher
e he could not for the life of him figure out how.
 They had found water though, so Amonas was optimistic that they would find
 a way to build a fire as well.
 Hilderich thought to himself that he found Amonas to be very convincing
 and reassured himself before feeling unmistakably hungry, his stomach sounding
 like a cauldron on fire with nothing inside the broth but bubbling water.

 Try and find some kind of root, stem or plant in general you think might
 be safe to eat.
 I don't mean taste good, mind you.
 Just something that won't kill us by eating it, not right off anyway.
 I know I can leave you to it while I gather what wood and fiber I can manage

 It was the voice of a leader Hilderich realized, a man who seemed fit enough
 for the task at hand: keeping them alive.

Hilderich nodded and accepted the task, though as in most cases without

Amonas went about making his make-shift tent and Hilderich disappeared from
 sight trying to find something edible.
 Within less than half an hour Amonas had laid down a few logs, most of
 them half rotten and half dead but good enough for the job at hand.
 He had stacked them so as to make a simple crude roof of sorts and then
 covered the simple skeleton with freshly snapped branches and twigs.
 In the end, he overlaid huge thick leaves from the innumerable plants available
 all around them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He hoped these would suffice and once he had massed enough pieces of wet
 yet not soggy wood, he piled it down neatly to form a fire stack, wishing
 his flint and stone would be enough to get the fire going.
 He called out to Hilderich to check if he had found anything at all.
 While he received no reply for a few moments, the moment he started to
 feel worried about his whereabouts Hilderich popped out of a cluster of
 bushes with what seemed to be an armful of large, thick mushrooms.

Hilderich was shouting enthusiastically when he walked over the stacked

 Displeased with the available options he decided to just stand there, a
 load of mushrooms twice the size of his fists carried in his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas smiled, greatly pleased and mildly surprised both for their luck
 as well as for the gleam in Hilderich's eyes.
 It was a genuine expression of happiness however transient and irrelevant

Hilderich indeed lowered his body almost in a squatting position to put
 down the load of mushrooms as intact as possible.
 They formed a somewhat neat pile that did not immediately crumble when
 he let go of his arms.
 He then searched through the numerous pockets in his vest and procured
 a small metal flask which he in turn proffered to Amonas with a radiant,
 beaming smile.

 suns seemed to have risen earlier on that particular day or at least the

 At every level of office and hierarchy, the living mechanisms of the Ministry,
 the Army and the Procrastinators were of a singular mind and purpose: The

In every single office and chamber of the various organizations of people

Lesser officials busied themselves with arranging communiques, writing down

If anything were to happen to this whole enterprise, this majestic war footing,
 this Holy Campaign that had been blessed by the Gods and commanded by the

 forgot to sent out some matériel requisition form or a call-to-arms teller.
 Indeed, if such a Campaign were to fail because of a human error in such

 not be because of the lowly gears in the machine that worked above and

Diligence was considered a virtuous characteristic and most Law-abiding
 parents tried to hammer that into their children if they had to, so as
 to become people worthy of upholding the Law whenever they could, whatever

 service as Ministers, Procrastinators, or Army officers, according to how
 well they performed at the Agogeia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Select officials from these three embodiments of rule and order taught at
 the Agogeia, schools for those that could afford to become something useful
 in their lives.
 After the basics, such as obedience to Law, reciting scripture and fairly
 simple counting and sword-fighting skills, the best of each class of children
 were selected for progression: that was done according to the inclination,
 receptiveness, and skill they showed at the various tests and games carried
 out to separate those who were capable of serving the people and the Gods
 and those who simply could not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Some of those who were better skilled in memory, oration, the use of language
 and emotion, and showed a certain ability to swaying the hearts and minds
 of their fellow students, were further trained to become Ministers.
 They were inundated into the teachings and trappings of the Law and were
 taught how to best interpret Law according to need.
 They learned the intricacies of teaching, enlightening, and chastising
 the layman.
 They were most importantly shown how to impress and guide hundreds, if
 not thousands of people as the Law, the Ministry, and the Ruling Council
 dictated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

They were responsible for the enlightenment of the people, teaching them
 Law and helping them avoid the temptations that would lead to blasphemy,
 heresy, eternal damnation, and a most probably gruesome, demeaning execution
 that would serve as a reminder and a lesson that All is Law and no one
 and nothing is above it.
 The Ministers also tended to the daily running of the Territories as administra
tive officials, collecting offerings and making amendments to the lesser
 decrees of the Law to better handle the multitude of people and the realities
 the land of the living required, with its needs of economy, trade, and
 resources.

The spending of coin for public works would be decided and then dispersed

 One day, one of their number would be chosen from the Castigator with the

Those of the Agogeia students who were energetic, athletic students, and
 showed exceptional stamina and strength; those who exemplified martial
 prowess both with blade and bare hands, those who were blessed with possessing

 as fit for service in the Army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Rigorous training in all the known aspects of warfare was their sole occupation
 unto death.
 Whether or not they would be called upon to act, to kill or be killed in
 service to the Gods, they would train with sword and spear, shield and
 horse until the ailings of old age would force them to continue serving
 by training others of their kind.
 In matters such as the planning and design of warfare where a mind should
 be much more fit than the body, their experience and long years of service
 were unmatched, and those traits they used when passing the torch to the
 ones that would succeed them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Their training began with single combat techniques utilising many different
 weapons, under different situations and varying levels of duress.
 Then they progressed into infantry squad tactics in the open field against
 other types of units like cavalry, or steamers and artillery.
 And then they would rotate into the rest of the units in order for their
 training to be complete and be able to use everything from bare hands to
 a complex steamer machine.
 Such a practice also made them knowledgeable in the weakness and strength
 of each type of unit, making them able to select the best course of action
 and the kind of men, machines and animals it would require to be successful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
These were the core lessons they were taught: strength in knowledge, success
 in adaptability, glory in death.
 As they progressed through the standings of the Army always according to
 their merit and degree of success in their duties, they always kept in
 mind their faithful devotion.
 Through their accrued experience they learned more about handling men,
 matériel, and equipment; they became excellent organizers, designers and
 planners with tens of thousands of men in their mind as one day they might
 be called upon to lead the whole Army as Generals, in the name of the Pantheon
 first, and the Castigator second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Those that did not excel in anything but showed average skill at wielding
 a sword and could learn enough of the Law as it was needed orally, those
 did not learn to read and write like the Minister's did, nor did they train
 any further in order to excel into combat.
 These children were strictly chosen for their ability to follow the letter
 of the Law blindly and unerringly, to keep a watchful eye for signs of
 heresy and insubordination as well as any element that was an affront to
 the Pantheon and the Law, or anything that might defy the Law or its upholders
 in spirit or in letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
These were the ever watchful eyes of the Castigator, the arm that made the
 Law reach into every heart, body, and mind: the Procrastinators.
 Their training was simple, crude, and effective.
 It hammered into them the utmost loyalty to the Law, and tought them how
 to use people in order to learn all that was needed: the rumors, the happenings
, the weddings and deaths, births and oath-takings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Everything that went on not just in Pyr, but everywhere in the Territories,
 they made it their job to know.
 If the need arose they disciplined and re-enlightened.
 At times they would bring to the Ministers those they deemed suspicious
 or knew to be genuinely guilty of sin.
 Then they would enforce the Law and the divine will of the Ministry with
 unflinching loyalty, following the credo that All is Law.
 If they performed their tasks impeccably, surely they would have a chance
 at being given the honor of becoming Procrastinator Militant: part of the
 Ruling Council, the left hand of the Castigator himself.

All that was a structure that had been handed down from the Gods themselves.
 That meant that its purpose and form were Holy, and any talk of reform,
 change, or deviation from the established norm was treated at best as blasphemy
 but usually it was deemed heretical, and was treated accordingly by public
 torture and death.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

None were exempt from such punishment, especially the men in the Ruling
 Council who were meant to be the paragon of Law itself for all the people

 Such a hideous concept was not unknown, that a man in the Ruling Council
 would denounce the Gods by committing or speaking heresy: it had happened
 long ago, in a past almost rightly forgotten and excised from the Annals
 of the Territories.
 Its memory still lingered though in the people's minds as Shan's Betrayal,
 a myth to frighten the children into obeying, a fable to instruct and put
 the fear of the Gods into the soul of men, but indeed part of a history
 long ago forcefully cast into oblivion.

Shan had been a General of the Army at a time when the Territories had not

 back; the chastisement had brought him to the brink of death.

 a beggar.
 He had been given the opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of the
 Pantheon, the people, and the Castigator.
 He acceded and the armies marched off, gleaming in their metal armor, the
 blessings of the Castigator sung over the Southern Gates of Pyr.
 Within a few weeks Shan's armies seemed to have been lost, and no message
 of the war had reached Pyr; not a single messenger sent from Pyr ever returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One day, Shan appeared over the hills encircling Pyr, and had with him not
 only the armies he had marched off with weeks before, but horses as well,
 and men, catapults and hellish contraptions that spurted fire and death.
 He had spread his heresy to the armies like the mythic whores of old spread
 disease; like a cancer that spreads from the roots of a tree to its leaves
 and brings about its death.
 And he had the Urfalli with him, their machines working in ways unfathomable,
 the heinous products of heretical pacts with the forces of evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He reached the Gates of Pyr and demanded the surrender first and foremost
 of the Ruling Council.
 The man also had the ineffable audacity to accuse the Council of lies and
 crimes to the people, twisting the word of the Law and spewing forth horrific
 untruths.
 It was an attempt to poison the minds of every man, woman, and child in
 the city as well, promising that none of those who surrendered willingly
 would be hurt in any way, and that a fair trial would be arranged for all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Except for the Council, who would be executed after their supposed lies
 had been exposed and their non-existent crimes against men proven unquestionabl
y.
 Such heretic lies had never been uttered before and never would be again,
 their venomous treachery so base that the Castigator himself is said to
 have cried in desperation, for he had never thought a dearly loved brother
 like Shan could fall from grace like a star falls from the night sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The city was utterly defenseless save but a few procrastinators and old
 army tutors.
 The rest of its defenders were lowly farmers, herders, artisans and traders
 that had not yielded shield, spear or sword for once in their lives.
 The armies of Shan had cast away all form of decency or honor and had turned
 into a rabble of heretics.
 They had begun to scour the lands pillaging, raping, and burning, before
 they dug their teeth in what they thought would be the grand feast of Pyr
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But they never managed to sink their putrid claws into the immaculate flesh
 of the City of Pyr for it was protected by the Gods, as are all their faithful
 and humble servants.
 For when the time was nigh and all seemed lost, the Castigator Hanul Ofodor
 the 1st, retired from the halls of the Disciplinarium and went deep into
 the Sacred Vaults, where he and the Patriarch offered their blood to commune
 with the Gods and ask for deliverance in that time of need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
For a day and a night, while the heretic hordes of Shan looted and pillaged
 the lands, while the outer walls of Pyr were about to fall, an angel sent
 from the Gods appeared in their image, and cast brilliant rays of cleansing
 light annihilating the armies of Shan who had no other recourse but to
 flee like the vermin they were.
 None escaped the angel's wrath, who spread the cleansing fire to every
 last part of Shan's army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When the Day of Redemption had passed, the City of Urfall and its majestic
 harbor and proud workshops were all extinguished in a ball of light so
 pure in its wrath that those who saw it with bare eyes went blind, and
 would forever be praised for the rest of their lives as Martyrs of the
 Wrath of the Gods, spreading the tale of Shan and what they had seen to
 everywhere they went.
 And such was the way the story was told from one generation to the next,
 as a reminder of the fallibility of even the most righteous and pious of
 men.
 The official Annals never admitted or recorded it, since Shan's betrayal
 should never have happened in the eyes of the Gods; and so it seemed as
 it never really had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Such was the tale of Shan Lagus, the Betrayer; proscribed from history,
 but alive in the memory of Law-fearing people.
 People like the Arch-minister La Vasse, a wide, big-boned man, dressed
 in an opulent surplice with holy texts in High Helican weaved around its
 sleeves and a Seal of Office hanging round his neck in a pendant made of
 platinum and emeralds, fittingly pure and clean to represent the qualities
 an Arch-minister should possess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was presently sitting at the Strategium Proper in the company of the
 General of the Army and the Procrastinator Militant.
 His embarrassing near-blunder at last night's festivities at the announcement
 of the Last Holy Campaign as it was officially now named, had not gone
 unnoticed: it had become the subject of sarcastic comments and irony even
 at the lower echelons of the Ministry and the Army, but had only naturally
 been ignored by the Procrastinators in whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The General of the Army had not been present at the event due to having
 received news of the Castigator's decision from beforehand: he had indeed
 spent the night hard at work putting his most trusted and capable people
 together, rousing them up from their sleep in order to lay down the priorities
 of planning and start orchestrating the massive preparations involved in
 such an endeavor as a Holy Campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had of course learned of the Procrastinator Militant's blunder and even
 though second hand accounts rarely manage to do justice, he had exchanged
 knowing looks and smiles with the Arch-minister that had gone largely unnoticed
 by the Procrastinator Militant; a somewhat alarming fact if one would care
 to extrapolate the level of the Procastinators' vigilance from the qualities
 apparent in its most senior member.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The three of them had been there from before dawn, the Arch-minister and
 the Procrastinator Militant arriving together even though they had ridden
 in separate coaches, having left from the Disciplinarium once proper etiquette
 was adhered to and the reenactment of the Pacification of Zaelin thoroughly
 completed, with all the bloodletting and the prayer that ensued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were now sipping fresh hot uwe tea comfortably seated at the General's
 planning chamber, all sorts of charts and maps laid out over a grand table.
 Heaps of reports and still unsigned orders were amassed upon the General's
 desk which was a utilitarian piece of furniture like most around the chamber,
 sturdy and well-made but otherwise unadorned and plain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Arch-minister was seated in the only luxurious chair available: plush
 velvet adorned its back and the sitting surface.
 Elegantly inlaid pieces of ivory, black granite and tether-wood intertwined
 in flowing designs on the stylish armrests.
 The Procrastinator Militant sat at a simple stool which was much more accommoda
ting for a soldier in search of a few moments of peace for resting his legs,
 rather than a man of such an office as a Procrastinator Militant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The General had briefly apologized to the Procrastinator Militant for lack
 of a better seating apparatus, and had at length explained that any and
 all equipment deemed to be of an extraneous nature was being dismantled
 to be put into other uses with the preparations for the campaign demanding
 every last bit of reusable material.
 That even included finely crafted chairs made from young sycamore wood
 and inlaid with ivory, granite, and tether-wood, not unlike the last one
 available for seating persons of importance, of which the Arch-minister
 seemed to be putting to such good use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Not that he implied at any point, the General had continued, that the Procrastin
ator Militant was not a person of incalculable importance but alas, the
 Arch-minister had seniority according to the Law of Founding.
 It was Law that essentially demanded the Arch-minister to be seated in
 the proper way, while he would have to make do with what little was available
 at such a time of need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
At that, the Procrastinator Militant withdrew from any thought or intention
 of protesting, and simply accepted the proffered stool graciously.
 By looking at the Arch-minister, if one didn't know better he might have
 misinterpreted his slight grin as an indication of silent enjoyment of
 the unfortunate predestinations of the Procrastinator on his behalf.
 Such a man though was beyond base thoughts of that sort; he was certainly
 merely grinning at the studious labor going on around the Strategium Proper,
 indirectly praising the high spirits of everyone involved and personally
 congratulating the General of the Army for kicking off the preparations
 in a way that was only expected of him:

 From what I know of the artisan's techniques, the ivory is used in delicate
 steamer parts without which the damnable things would blow up before going
 on for ten feet.
 The sycamore and tether-wood are used in the construction of the siege
 engines, and the granite is turned into pellets for the steamers' slingshots.

Oh, make no mistake Tyrpledge; my rank, office, and related trappings of

 At least in public, when we are not planning together, exchanging information
 and agreeing to our next best course of action.
 Be reminded of course, that the Castigator is always briefed on our meetings
 and though we have been given executive control of the Holy Campaign, whatever
 course of action we decide on has to be ratified by His Piousness.
 In grave matters of battle that is, since currently I have been empowered
 with freedom to act as the Castigator's proxy in these preliminary stages

La Vasse's voice had assumed a harsher tone, the weight in his voice and
 words punctuating his heightened status of authority.
 His strict but fair tone was indicative of his intentions: He would be
 reasonably cooperative and would dispense of the pleasantries and honors
 where applicable, but that would not bring Tyrpledge up to the same level
 as him, the proxy of the Castigator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He also seemed to limit this dispensation to Tyrpledge alone since Gomermont,
 apart from being a relatively useless dolt which was widely regarded as
 the most common type of Procrastinator, his office also was not immediately
 pertinent to the Campaign; he and his men would remain in the cities and
 townships, ever watchful for signs of insurrection and heresy when the
 Castigator and the complete armed might of the Territories would be in
 the Widelands.

Tyrpledge was simply a soldier, a sword to be wielded like a tool, bending
 to the master's will.
 He had never had any misconceptions of his status, and the Arch-minister's

 diligently and respectfully, he just didn't have to stand at attention
 the whole time.

La Vasse, I need to know.
 You are closest to the Castigator.
 You are his proxy, as well as probably the only reliable person I can talk

 The Widelands are wild lands, there are no people living there.
 No sane people that I know of, at least.
 No cities, no towns to speak of; nothing to capture and maintain.
 With no population to enlighten, no known forces arrayed against us, what
 objectives should I designate? What provisions will I require? What manner
 of equipment should I gather, what should the disposition of our forces
 be? How will our forces move? What, exactly, will we be going up against,
 Arch-minister?

 Indeed, it was a feat in itself.

 But these things were of nature, and the marble road clearly was not; for
 nature abhors uniqueness.
 Animals come in pairs, rivers abound, and so do trees.

Only a few nights after we had definitely passed into the Widelands, we
 lost track of the road.
 We decided to camp quite a distance away from it, towards what had seemed
 to be a natural spring in a rock formation.
 After we had laid to rest, in the morning we had lost sight of the marble
 road.
 We were doubly misled, since the spring had dried out and there was no
 water to speak of as well.
 The maps had failed us early on.
 Terlet went mad and master Umberth ordered me to put him out of his misery.
 Nubir and Vamden probably got lost trying to find the road, or simply decided
 to run back to civilized country before we went deeper into the Widelands.
 In any case, we never saw or heard of them again.

This place was unforgiving.
 The road was like a lifeline, his only hope of making sense of direction

 He would keep on it for as far as it took him, and try to make sense of

The exact location of the Necropolis was a mystery to him, but he knew that
 it lay further deep into the Widelands; into its Dunes, the desert proper.
 He hoped the road would eventually take him there.
 He was worried that food and water would become even more scarce in the

He still had a ready supply of honey-laden bars of nuts and sesame; it was

The more that the Widelands turned into a desert, the more imperative it
 became for him to conserve his water.
 That is why he had chosen to travel at night: because it was cooler and

He believed it would be possible to find sources of water as he went along,
 at least until he reached the Dunes.
 He doubted any water could be found in that place at all, for days on end.
 And that was where he would either perish or triumph.
 Deep in the desert dunes of the Widelands, searching for the Necropolis.

As was his preferred way, he waited for dusk to come and the suns to disappear
 from the sky before he would start walking again.
 He picked up his knapsack and his walking stick and started off once more,
 feeling he had won a small battle.
 Renewed vigor and determination coursed through him, each one of his steps
 brimming with confidence.
 He felt like he needed no road to find his path and he could carve himself
 a path worthy of his own legendary tale, forever sung in the eons to come.

A soldier can serve the Gods, the Council, and the people in one of two
 important ways: that is, he can either be dead or alive, but he will still
 serve.
 A soldier might choose either but one of the two has proved extremely popular,
 and for good reason.
 As a soldier myself with as much experience as any can hope to amass over
 the years, I can only share with you a rough guideline on how to live long
 enough to write your own manual: Avoid the meaningless battles, and especially
 politics.

The Patriarch stood still, his attention drawn to a few pieces of clothing
 and some belongings that were gathered on a shabby old table with jutting
 splinters and worn-away cuts all over its rough surface.
 He picked at some of the clothing with the edge of his patriarchal Rod,
 the sigils and High Helican scripts etched on its golden knob top barely
 visible in the dim torchlight of the torture chamber.

He sniffed the air around the ragged, bloodied clothing, and a grimace of
 distaste and scorn appeared on his otherwise solidly expressionless face.
 Some said he sometimes looked as if he was wearing a mask, rather than
 a real human face.
 And then there were the tales of him sitting idly in the dark without ever
 sleeping, or that he never asked for food or drink to be served.
 Fewer still feared he might not be a man.
 It was indeed wondrous what the human mind could attribute to persons of
 unimaginable power.
 The rumours made the Patriarch laugh sometimes.

None were brave or stupid enough though to point out such troubled thoughts

All these kinds of curious, imaginative and disrespectful people who could

 Some simply vanished with neither body nor bone left behind, not even as

The Patriarch smiled at the thought of people being capable of voicing such
 audacity and felt almost impressed.
 Naturally, such phenomena had subsided considerably after it became a well-know

 There was a popular saying that applied well to that fact: `When people
 talk, the Patriarch listens'.
 Still from time to time people tend to forget what has come to pass before
 their time, but they are on occasion grimly reminded not to speak of the
 Holy Avatar in anything less than reverent hymns to his Holiness, divine
 origin, and purpose.

The Chief Inquisitor stood in reverent attention a few steps next to the
 Patriarch with his head bowed and his gaze averted from the Holy Avatar's

 It was a sign of reverent servitude and deference, which was in fact nothing

 Before speaking, the Inquisitor cleared his throat and licked his lips
 momentarily, his forehead glistening slightly with perspiration.
 He stood in a bowed position with hands knitted together, hidden inside
 the sleeves of his surplice.
 With a deep voice full of worshipful tones, he simply said:

The Patriarch was still examining the small pile of clothes; the contents
 of a leather pouch and a small sack that were found on the man shackled
 against the wall, seemed to attract his attention.
 His visage showed a man detached from his surroundings, seemingly deeply
 engrossed in a detailed cataloguing of what the prisoner was carrying on
 his person.
 It was as if he was searching for something his servants and people might
 have missed, something important that he had to make certain of himself

The Patriarch cast a gaze of subdued anger at the Inquisitor, his otherwise
 serene face the cause of a disturbing, fearful sensation.
 The effect was rather unsettling and the Inquisitor bowed deeper still
 as a physical reaction to the Patriarch's menacing look.
 It was evident he felt real fear afflicting him to the bone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Patriarch took notice of the Inquisitor's fear and felt pleased.
 Fear was a most useful tool he liked to regularly employ.

You should be careful not to recite the obvious, Chief Inquisitor.

 That would be most unpleasant.
 I would have to choose a new Chief Inquisitor and the technicalities of
 such an affair, though sometimes I must admit I find somewhat pleasant,

 Not to mention there are ongoing issues that demand my attention and there's

 So please Chief Inquisitor, spare me the mundane and tell me something

The Chief Inquisitor who in his long years of service had witnessed and

The Patriarch could see the man was visibly trembling.
 He was just another weak minded fool.
 He would have to be dispensed of sooner rather than later, but not immediately.
 Other matters would have to take precedence.
 These were the traitors, more aptly sinners, that liked to pronounce themselves

 The Kinsfolk, he believed they called themselves now.
 Delusional fanatics, sprouts of a seed long thought extinct, dire remnants

He should have personally eradicated the lot of them, a long time before

He thought that he should have known better, he should have seen it would

His hands were finally, figuratively speaking of course, loose.
 He would break down their spine, their will, and their determination.
 He had the means to accomplish that and with some careful steps it would

 affairs of chasing wild dreams that turn into ashes when the night is through.

His part would be small as always; the stage would be filled with other

 Nevertheless he felt he would genuinely enjoy crushing the fools utterly;

He had been absorbed in these thoughts for a rather discomforting period

As he distanced himself back from the wall to have more room to lash out

 The torture chamber reverberated with his voice for mere moments, the flames

 sucked out of the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The flogger set down his instrument of torture and bowed reverently as fast

The Inquisitor managed a slightly expectant look towards the Patriarch,

He now seemed instead a hollow, reduced man: his surplice spoiled and mudded,

The Patriarch was studying the prisoner intently with a deeply frowned face,
 as if trying to uncover everything he needed to know merely by watching

 His right hand, the one adorned with the Holy Diadems, was scratching his

 earlier searing demeanor.
 He addressed the Inquisitor without turning around or barely moving his
 head, his voice carrying hints of aggravation:

The Patriarch's voice carried a finality that could not be challenged.
 The flogger did not even bother picking up his tools, bowing once more

 upper levels of the tunnels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Inquisitor had no intention of uttering a single sentence that could
 very well be his last and with a series of deep bows and small steps made
 his way to the staircase as well, being very cautious not to turn his back

 The moment he reached the base of the stairs as ready as he was to turn
 and hurriedly run them up, the Patriarch raised his left hand and with
 his gaze still fixed on Philo, he asked the Inquisitor:

The Patriarch's last words struck true.
 The Inquisitor managed to simply nod and rushed up the stairs as if swaths
 of fire were behind him.
 A dull metal thud echoed, the large door to the chamber closing right behind
 the Inquisitor.
 The Patriarch then walked closer to Philo who was still alive and currently
 awake, unable though as he lay with his face towards the wall to look at
 his captor.
 A grin that threatened to tear the Patriarch's face apart suddenly appeared
 on his face revealing his immaculate pearly white teeth for no one to see.

Rivulets of blood stained his whole body, from his shoulders down to his
 legs.
 His feet were bare and bruised livid underneath, the skin so deeply stained

 Philo's thickset body had lost its healthy color; a pallid skin implied
 he was less than feeble.

\begin_layout Standard

Philo did not answer verbally, neither did he nod.

 The Patriarch wished dearly for an easy answer, a

 He wanted to see a recognition of being outplayed, an acceptance of defeat,
 the knowledge of pointlessness proven in Philo's resignation from the fight
 before it could even really begin.
 There was such joy to be had in the feeling of superiority, that the Patriarch
 almost trembled with anticipation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But he also knew Philo would not choose the easy way out.
 He was too proud, too ignorant and too stupid to do so.
 He was unable to spare himself from the immeasurable heights of pain he
 would fail to endure, the unbearable humiliation; he would suffer the final
 destruction of his mind, body, and soul.

`How embarrassingly naive,' the Patriarch thought to himself.
 He decided that he would leave Philo's tongue and throat intact for as

 Their own screams always became insufferable to them.
 Philo would be driven mad by the time he was through with him.
 A mad, witless fool.
 Not a martyr, but a wretched sack of flesh.

It was, the Patriarch thought, an art form.
 He wished he could make Philo understand before he began, but that would
 be an exercise in futility.
 Words would not affect him; Philo's ears and mind had been closed shut

 It was of little consequence, because soon he would become so much more
 receptive, like a child only now beginning to learn.
 Philo Dutur would learn so much about himself in so little time.

The Patriarch was filled with a fleeting sensation of jealousy: he told
 himself in his mind how blessed indeed these people were, to be stripped
 down to their essential self.
 How unique to be able to see clearly for just once; to understand what
 everything meant, the truth of life bared naked before their crying souls.

He almost wished he could experience that first hand, but he had the knowledge

That having being said, the Patriarch reached for Philo's chains; a mere

 His right side, he believed, was nearer to the Patriarch; he mustered all
 the strength that he could and focused it on his elbow, suddenly jutting
 it towards the Patriarch's groin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he did that, he was already clenching his left fist, trying to gather
 some momentum by twisting his torso and perhaps landing a good punch on
 the Patriarch's face.
 He knew that this was probably his last and only opportunity, so he thought
 he'd make it count and go for the kill as well, his mind focused on reaching
 the motley arsenal of torturing tools available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His elbow did not connect with the Patriarch's groin.
 Instead, he felt a rush of air as if a void was suddenly created where
 the Patriarch had been standing.
 As his torso swooped around in its instinctive movement, his feet swiveled
 to accommodate the sudden move and his left fist came rushing down only
 to meet thin air.
 His body was awkwardly positioned now and precariously balanced, openly
 inviting hits of retribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Patriarch was not where he should have been and was instead at Philo's
 left side now; it was as if he had instantly sidestepped him with inhuman
 speed, impossible reflexes, and divine foresight.
 As Philo turned his bruised head around to see, he had one eye completely
 hidden behind swollen tissue.
 His other eye was damaged and bled almost beyond recognition, but still
 it seemed to function.
 Evidently surprised and dumbstruck, he managed to ask the Patriarch:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Philo went limp almost instantly, his big bulk sagging down onto the floor;
 his legs were sprawled awkwardly and his arms simply rested against his
 body, barely touching the bloodied floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His face, or what was still left of it, tried to take on an expression of
 pain; he flinched and his visage contorted violently.
 Suddenly his face slackened and his mouth opened up to reveal his broken
 teeth and the numerous open sores and wounds.
 He started to mewl incoherently, blood and saliva dribbling down his chin;
 he tried to voice incomprehensible words sputtered in blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Patriarch smiled.
 His face lit up at the sight of the broken Philo and he seemed pleased
 that his work was beginning to take form now.
 He asked Philo in a sweet, inviting voice:

Philo seemed to twist his body a little as if trying to escape an invisible

Philo let out a deep moan and his eyes tried to let tears flow, even though
 it was nearly impossible.
 His eyes were practically swollen shut and the tears welled up constantly,
 making what little vision he had left, a complete blur.
 His groaning became deeper, and his body started to shake involuntary;
 he could feel the spasms of death approaching, washing over him.
\end_layout

The Patriarch screamed in hellish fury and the air around them cracked audibly.
 Small arcs of fierce blue lightning flickered between the Patriarch's ringed

Philo's skull was throbbing and enormous veins jutted from his head which

 was about to snap:

He let go of Philo who instantly regained some sort of composure, however

 His voice now little more than a whisper, Philo said amidst weeps and moans
 of pain:

When the other guards came to relieve them, the screams and voices could

When the Patriarch emerged from the door of the torture chamber, the guards

 The Patriarch said to the first one he laid his eyes on:

 had finally slept, his protestations about the lack of a night sky silently
 put aside when his fatigue took over and the anxiety and nervousness subsided

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was snoring heavily and though it would have normally been less than
 a pleasant sound, under the circumstances it was mildly comforting.
 It let Amonas know that not everything was amiss, that some things were
 still normal albeit frustrating and hard to deal with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Such a thing was the sound of Hilderich's snore.
 Amonas tried to picture a future lady D'Augnacy going to sleep next to
 the somewhat handsome young man, but failed to end his train of thought
 in anything other than a grin or a hearty laughter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He nodded to himself thinking it was a good thing that Hilderich had slept
 after all that had befallen him; he definitely needed to sleep more than
 he did so himself.
 Not that he didn't wish for sleep to come and bless him with a few precious
 hours of oblivion and rest, but he could cope while Hilderich could not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had a nagging feeling, he knew; rest would not come even in his sleep.
 Nightmares would haunt him as long as he was away from Celia, as long as
 he couldn't know what fortune held in stock for her should he fail to return.
 He had to entertain the idea that he could be stranded in this lush version
 of hell with Hilderich as his sole companion for the rest of their lives.
 The thought alone was unbearable.
 It wasn't because of Hilderich, the man kept interesting company; living
 without Celia though would be impossible for him.
 He'd rather take his own life than be forced to live with memories of her
 alone, each waking moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas was sitting cross-legged without the cover of the small makeshift
 shelter he had fashioned; most of it was taken over by the sprawled figure
 of Hilderich who seemed to be thankfully quite at ease sleeping on the
 almost bare ground, with nothing but his already muddied and stained cloak
 as a mattress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
On the other hand, he could not let himself surrender to sleep.
 It was not the lack of night or the invariably harsh conditions of continuous
 lighting, unbearable heat, and sticky moisture that prevented him from
 having some kind of much needed rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was, as was the case most of the time, his mind that could not be appeased,
 that could not be turned off as it should.
 The immediate necessities had taken their toll of thoughts already.
 The water, which he still didn't know whether or not was indeed drinkable;
 the food he hoped would not prove much of a problem now that they knew
 there was at least something edible to be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But it was not just the simple minded anxiety of surviving: it was this
 strange new environment, totally unlike anything he had experienced before.
 Certainly nothing he had ever known to exist, not even on the most faraway
 of lands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The suns were wrong as well.
 He was beginning to accept the possibility they might not even be on their
 own world.
 The thought had unconsciously been formed before, when they had first seen
 that clear, harsh sky.
 Now though, it took form and voice; he could hear the thought ringing loudly
 in his head.
 `This might be another world'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The ultimate truth was revealed in form and substance all over him.
 And he had no one to share it with but Hilderich, who might even hold such
 a fact as suspicious but implausible at best.
 Another world with no animals to speak of and no people, however queer
 or similar, friendly or hostile they might have been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He suddenly felt terribly alone; the thought of them being the sole two
 individuals on this other world was weighing him down, grinding him to
 the damp, muddy ground.
 Just the two of them wandering like castaways on a strange and mysterious
 island where no ship would ever sail to.
 An uncharted land with its existence always hidden away, never to be revealed;
 a future that would see their bones bleached and turned into lime for the
 wild growths to set their roots in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His gaze turned to the tiny flickers of the fire; a few coals were still
 red hot and thin lines of smoke rose from the perpetually wet wood.
 He focused on the fire, marveling at its simple avarice.
 It consumed the wood steadily and unperturbed, without a care for the world
 at large.
 It was a force of nature, a universal truth: eating away as much as it
 can and then perishing of its own accord, accepting its inevitable fate
 to end.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
How he longed for such simplicity in his own life.
 Away from this world, as well as the world he had known as home.
 Away from the Castigator's tyranny and its false Gods.
 Away from poverty, the coming war and the misery that would ensue no matter
 who the victor was.
 How much he had wanted to get away from all that with Celia by his side.
 Had she been with him here, he could have let the world burn for all he
 cared.
 Just like fire, burning through wood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He smirked despite himself, thinking he was letting himself down somehow.
 Perhaps he had been too morose in his thoughts; their plight so far had
 sunk his feelings even more than he had realized.
 Such a mood would do him no good, that he knew.
 No matter whether any of these thoughts hold any truth, in the end they
 would do him no real good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He knew that thinking too much and acting too little had somehow brought
 everything to this point.
 A rule of tyranny, based on lies and deceit.
 People dying everyday of famine, people rotting away in eternally dark
 dungeons for stealing a loaf of bread, or having children without the blessed
 permission of the Ministry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He shook his head.
 Permission was needed to create life.
 As if any God would need to hinder the inevitable, unimpeachable, unstoppable
 force of life that permeated everything, from the worms in the ground to
 the stars themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was indeed a sad moment when a star fell; he remembered having heard
 though that another one was born at the same time.
 He had no way of knowing that for sure though; who could count the innumerable
 stars or the grains of sand in a beach? But he knew it in his heart to
 be true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Life just keeps happening.
 Whether anyone permits it or not, it doesn't seem to care; it blindly goes
 on whatever the cost.
 Even in this place.
 They might have encountered no animals so far, but the vegetation was astoundin
g.
 Lush, vivid green, everywhere the eye could see.
 If it wasn't so damn hot and humid he could have felt like living here
 for ever.
 Him, Celia, and their children.
 The many more to come after his firstborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Would he ever live to see all that come true?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He sighed.
 He knew that thinking in such an almost saturnine way did not suit him.
 He stood up and decided to clear his mind, flush it clean of any thought.
 Any kind of action would do his spirits good.
 Since he couldn't rest or sleep, a mild activity that would not drain him
 of much energy would be a welcome change in pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would go for a walk, in a way to explore their immediate surroundings.
 Perhaps, he thought, he could even scout ahead their path to the bull-horned
 structure, that huge fork that had seemed so impeccably dominating even
 from afar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich stirred in his sleep mumbling something inaudible; he licked his
 lips and smiled lightly.
 `He must be dreaming,' Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The fact that Hilderich could sleep as if nothing of import had transpired
 over the past few days brought a smile of hope to Amonas' lips.
 Perhaps not everyone looked on things so dourly, and had good reason not
 to.
 So did he, he thought to himself, bringing an image of lovely Celia to
 his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Lovely Celia; her hair touching her slender body with grace enough to make
 any man weep from the joyful sight and instantly adore her beyond reason.
 Her face would have had a sweet and mellow taste if his eyes could swallow
 her whole, and forever feel her smile.
 Celia beloved, and to the death his mate and pair.
 His firstborn's mother to be, his miraculous haven where every storm subsided,
 where all the seas came to rest and all the rivers ran home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She was not far from giving birth to their child and though they had known
 bloody times of fire, steel and death were drawing close, he at least had
 the surety of her touch and her smile to count on to meet life or death
 by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Now he was denied of her touch, the smell of her breath, the feeling of
 her body clasped against his own.
 He could not look upon her gaze locked with his own and see the oceans
 of time passing by in mere moments.
 Damn them! For that hurt alone, he would make them pay.
 Whoever was indeed behind all the lies and curtains of deceit.
 Behind the Castigator.
 He could feel there must be something to the Gods.
 Every lie, he had observed, has been sown from some sort truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he walked about the place, he noticed more and more beauty; life was
 celebrating in this otherwise simmering cauldron of green.
 Small colorful flowers with overgrown petals and fat, juicy stems.
 Lithe trees that could be easily bent without being broken, and thick overgrown
 plants that dared climb the huge trees hugging them, curled around them
 like charmed snakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was indeed a place teeming with life.
 It remained a mystery to Amonas why they had come across no animals at
 all and barely enough insects to simply make their unwanted stay even more
 miserable.
 He mused for a while at the strange color of the suns, and decided he could
 not come up with anything resembling an explanation other than this was
 another world to their own indeed wholly alien and undecipherable, at least
 with the knowledge at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps they could learn more of it before they returned, but that would
 be something more relevant to Hilderich's domain and not his own.
 He was more interested in solving problems, not analyzing them thoroughly
 and documenting them for posterity and further study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He thought with a smile that it would be a strange day indeed when he would
 be able to sit in a chair and tell his grandchildren stories of the other
 world.
 Or maybe even worlds.
 If there are indeed more than one, why should there only be two?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The walk had made him thirsty and he felt like maybe it was time for him
 to return; with his mind put a little bit at ease perhaps he would try
 and get some restful sleep.
 Even though he was used to hardship, he did not think sleep was not essential
 and he knew no one could go more than a day or so without even a few minutes
 of sleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had also climbed up an inviting tree in an effort to see over the canopy
 if at all possible and get their bearings, so they could start off in the
 right direction for the nearest bull-horn.
 Getting the direction wrong while already being lost would be a blow to
 their morale, let alone a waste of precious time and meager resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His thoughts suddenly ran back to his brothers in arms: back in their own
 world, the Kinsfolk were about to strike for the first and hopefully the
 last time.
 Years of planning had led to this culminating point, and an untold number
 of his brethren had lost their lives in the effort of keeping it a secret
 alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He knew they were being followed, he knew they were being watched.
 But he also knew they were waiting for the right time to act and catch
 them all in one fell blow, root them out forever, crush them utterly and
 dispense with the notion of a rebellion for untold generations to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had to be there when the time came, that much was at the least expected
 of him.
 And he'd rather die trying rather than abandon and shame his blood and
 soul brothers, or face the wrathful scorn of Celia; no, that alone, he
 could never suffer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A weak but warm smile crept on his face as he imagined such a scene, Celia
 engulfed in all-fiery wrath, her gaze searing, boring through him as if
 he were made of powdery snow.
 He laughed despite himself, loving memories of her rushing through him
 like a stream of water on parched land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he approached their tiny camp he could hear Hilderich screaming his name
 over the top of his lungs, sounding terrified at the thought that he had
 gone and left him there to die all alone, the final twist of an incongruously
 ill fate.
 He answered back, his strong gruff voice undimmed by the blanket of vegetation
 all around them:

A few more steps brought Amonas nearer to their camp where he could see
 Hilderich quite evidently disheveled, his thin blond hair in wild disarray
 from the sleep and the humid hell they had to endure, his clothing almost
 unrecognizable by now, a uniformly gray and brown mud covering most of
 it.
 Amonas waved a dismissing hand from afar, laughed heartily and replied
 playfully:

His good humor went largely unnoticed by Hilderich, whose spirits where
 in sharp contrast.
 He looked genuinely hurt, glum and uninspired, giving Amonas a picture
 of how he must've looked a couple of hours before.
 The thought sobered his mood, and thought he had better make Hilderich
 bounce back from what must have been a seriously rude awakening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was keeping silent, casting a look of rightful accusation at Amonas,
 who thought it to be a little childish and perhaps somewhat unbecoming
 of a man.
 But their situation was indeed unique and perhaps he had been asking too
 much of the man already.
 He cast those blemished thoughts aside and instead spoke from the heart,
 seeking to calm Hilderich and soothe his fear:

Amonas reached into his small sack and brought out a small roundish object
 covered in what seemed to be something like hair, thin strands of wood

 He used his knife to chop off a small slice from its top, then offered
 it to Hilderich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich made a gesture to take the proffered little ball of what could
 have been fruit.
 It looked to be white on the inside, but he shook his head and gave it
 back to Amonas with a hesitant look on his face and a quavering quality
 in his voice:

Amonas' pride was stung: Hilderich seemed to imply that he might be trying
 to poison him.
 He was about to go off on a rant unfitting his character, about how misguided
 and foolish a person must be to still be unable to trust him after what
 had befallen them, but wisely decided against that.
 After his initial surprise and shock lifted from his expression, he took
 the strange cross between a hairy nut and a fruit in his hands and drank
 a good mouthful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
After he had quite thoroughly sloshed it around his mouth in an evident
 display of the juice's potable quality, he swallowed and offered it back
 to Hilderich who accepted it even though with some reluctance.
 He sniffed the watery liquid inside the strange fruit and kept his eyes
 on Amonas, who tried to appease his fears:

Amonas was motioning with his head for Hilderich to drink, urging him to
 just have a taste, while Hilderich slowly brought the fruit to his lips,
 constantly eying Amonas warily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

After a brief pause and a small period of uncertainty Hilderich finally
 took a small sip, swallowed, and then surprising even himself in the process
 proceeded to empty the small ball of a fruit of its watery content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas grinned in a relaxed manner as he laid down to the ground to enjoy
 at least a few minutes of sleep.
 After closing his eyes and covering his face with one arm, he said to Hilderich

Hilderich's tone was rather that of a grudging complaint rather than a gross

 `He might be right', Amonas thought, `but now was not the time to settle
 such a score'.
 He hoped that they would make it back, become friends, and Hilderich would
 forgive him for the misfortunes brought upon him.
 But until then, Amonas' patience would be tried and tested at almost every
 chance.
 He replied in kind, eyes still covered by his arm:

The thought had occurred in Hilderich's mind but he had not given it much
 time.
 With the death of his master and half-way in his apprenticeship, he was
 now considered officially, though without seat, a Curator, with all the
 rights and responsibilities his office carried.
 It was certainly not an apt time but he felt somewhat proud, and suddenly
 all too grown up and a bit older than he thought possible.
 Amonas added as an afterthought:

Hilderich nodded silently and appreciatively before heading off to a nearby
 log of wood half of it rotting away, creeping with maggots and worms, what
 he had been taught was the basis of a healthy and fertile ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Time passed quickly for Hilderich who uncovered all sorts of different layers
 of decaying wood, taking good notice of its grain and the various kinds
 of insects that used it as housing, food, or what seemed to be a combination
 of the two, eating tunnels through it on which then they laid what looked
 like to be their eggs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was fascinating he thought, to witness a whole civilization of insects
 in its various stages and levels unfolding in front of you in a simple
 piece of wood right in front of your eyes, at the tip of your very hands.
 How tempting it felt to push the eggs around and see how the insects would
 react, or douse them with water and see whether they'd drown.
 But he was taught that nature knew best, and men could only learn from
 it, not change it.
 At least not for the better.
 So he decided to let the insects be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he did so and paused his study of the insect-ridden log he noticed
 Amonas had quietly awoken, seemingly quite refreshed and energized.
 He asked him if he had slept well, to which Amonas answered laconically
 after briefly thinking about it:

Amonas then made some broth of what he had found to be an adequate substitute
 for uwe, and sipped appreciatively.
 Like before, he offered some to Hilderich who again politely refused, but
 did not resort to his small flask of gin.
 He wisely assumed that they would need more of it to light up a fire, and
 more than just once.
 So he kept Amonas some quiet company, until they would move on again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once they did so, Amonas led the way once more with quite deliberation,
 carefully choosing his path as if he could smell their destination however
 far it might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
To Hilderich, it was unfathomable how any man could navigate practically
 blind, without a map or a solid point of reference, simply using his hunch
 and a general feeling of direction.
 Both seemed to be easily fooled in a chaotic mass of vegetation such as
 the one they were entangled in currently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When Amonas felt Hilderich needed time to rest he paused, and made sure
 Hilderich was ready to move on before they set off again.
 Hilderich felt quietly thankful of that small mercy and made every effort
 to proceed in a timely manner, never dallying for too long.
 Until they had walked for the better part of what would amount to a day
 in this accursed place, or until they had reached the bull-horned building
 he would try his best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The heat was as always unbearable and the moisture nearly debilitating,
 but they trudged along hoping to strike lucky soon.
 If nothing else, Hilderich hoped they would soon rest for what should have
 been night time.
 Lost in thought and numbed by fatigue, Hilderich bumped unwillingly onto
 Amonas who seemed to have suddenly stopped.
 Hilderich apologized curtly and asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Pardon me for running onto you like you were invisible, but why have we
 stopped? Are we here yet? I can't see anything like a wall or stones or

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich's voice had an unmistakably pleading quality and though it would
 be indeed great if they had reached their intended destination, it would
 be nothing short of bliss if they could stop and sleep for now.
 Amonas knew what Hilderich was thinking from the look on his face and the
 expectancy in his voice, and replied curiously enough with a question:

Hilderich was about to make some comment in the same vein as the previous
 one, complaining about sore feet and an empty stomach, not to mention a
 dried out mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

But once Hilderich paused for little more than a moment, he felt it.
 A light breeze, chilly to the touch, a swift rush of air like a cloud from
 the heavens.

Well it's not chilly.
 It's not that hot, cool would be a better choice of words.

Hilderich was enjoying the cool breeze when he pleaded once more:

Amonas laughed out heartily at that display of good-humored single-mindedness,
 and feeling his spirits lifted laid down and started singing a tune his
 grandfather used to sing when they were fishing together, on a boat by
 the river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was complaining that his stomach felt empty, and that they had
 not secured a source of fresh water.
 He could also hear some grumblings noises about him doing all the really
 necessary stuff, and that Curators should be treated respectfully rather
 than being ignored profoundly.
 He stated then that he would nevertheless procure some sort of food since
 he was quite literally the only reliable and responsible person in this
 world, a world which might or might not be an entirely different one from
 the one they called home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas kept on singing heedless of Hilderich's protests, thinking he would
 be soundly asleep before the song would come to a finish.
 As the moments went by, his voice became softer and shallower and then
 he stopped altogether.
 Indeed within moments he fell into a slumber, where he dreamt of Celia.
 In the dream he could feel the cool breeze that was her smile.

 had woken as early as every day, giving thanks to God for allowing him
 to live and breathe once more and greeted the suns as they rose with a
 hearty smile.
 His hair was as always tousled, gently swayed by the light breeze rushing
 down from the mountains and onto the plains that filled his entire view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once more he had used his walking stone to guide him and before noon had
 passed he had entered the Land of God proper.
 He had been warned to be wary of these lands, for not everything that roamed
 it was graced by God and not all that he may encounter was sent by Him
 alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The devious ones, the forces of the archenemy had plans of their own and
 would likely oppose him when they saw fit.
 He would have to steel himself wholeheartedly if he were to carry on with
 his Pilgrimage and meet his ineffable destiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once he had stepped his foot on the Widelands, it was as the elders had
 said it would be: A flat and uninviting country, with low grass and trees
 few and afar; the sounds of animals and birds lost in an emptiness that
 defied the senses and made one humble and awestruck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Then he saw the True Path in all its glistening beauty and perfection, as
 unblemished as it had stood since the first Pilgrimage, so long ago in
 ages past but never forgotten.
 He was witnessing the path to his own destiny and soon he was walking on
 it, treading lightly with reverence whenever possible, but making haste
 and good speed.
 What good was the Path, if he dawdled on it for longer than prudence would
 allow?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As his peregrination took him further into the Land of God, his thoughts
 coalesced bit by bit into how this land was perhaps purposefully designed,
 meant to evoke ascetic feelings.
 Civilization in any form had been kept away this part of the world, as
 if it had been preordained that these lands would forever be a sanctum,
 a land devoted to praising God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was a land indeed forbidden to most mortal men, uninviting and hostile
 as far as he could tell until now.
 But the Path was there as a clear sign of God's design, a Path for the
 true believers, a Path for those that came with holy fire burning in their
 heart seeking God.
 A divine purpose guided such men deeper into a land that would normally
 kill one easily; be it of hunger, thirst or pure exhaustion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Distance lacked meaning in the Land of God, a land which almost defied logic
 in its flatness and its emptiness.
 An emptiness only the love of God and faith in him could fill.
 It was a terrible void that shrank the impure soul and made an unwilling
 mind recoil in primal fear, a land that turned the unbeliever away.
 It was a land where the mandate of God was carried ever more strongly by
 the formidable gusts of wind that swept its every acre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was indeed magnificent to behold the will of God made manifest all around
 him.
 He was in a sacred place that he was not only allowed, but indeed expected
 to traverse to its very heart to complete his Pilgrimage as his God and
 his people demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
God, in his inestimable wisdom had prepared the land more than well enough
 for a believer, for someone who lived and died with His name upon his lips,
 His thought in his mind and His image in the depths of his soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Water, he could find in the small damp spots around the Path, when night
 fell and a hazy carpet of fog crept across the immeasurably flat land.
 He would dig, with either his knife or his hands to find a few mouthfuls
 of water to sustain him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he felt hungry and tired with his strength about to leave him, it was
 if God kept an ever watchful eye on him from afar; a small thin bush laden
 with tiny berries would appear near the road, or a small colony of ants.
 The land would freely offer him sustenance, however meager it might look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He always thanked God for these small mercies that kept him fit and healthy,
 that kept him going without delay; he only made a few brief stops to rest
 his muscles and slept during the night.
 His clothes were as good for the Holy Land as it was for the lands where
 his people dwelt.
 Perhaps it was not as cold during the day, but the nights became colder
 the farther deep he went while following the Path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He kept the wise council of his elders, and never strayed off the road.
 He kept on it at all times and when he could, when leaving it to get to
 a source of water or find something to eat, he would always leave his walking
 stone on it; a piece of woolen string attached to it, laying it behind
 him as he walked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he had drank or eaten to fill his belly, he would pick up the string
 and walk right back to the Path and the walking stone.
 It was said that if one strayed off the Path, he might never find it again
 for as long as he walked the Land of God.
 It was blasphemy for the Path to be revealed to you and then choose to
 leave it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
So he would lay behind him a piece of string to always connect himself with
 the Path, even when not directly on it.
 He would do that because of strict necessity and only after solemn prayer
 in which he would beg for forgiveness, recognizing his own imperfection
 and crude humanity that afflicted him with the feeling of hunger and thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Thus he hoped and prayed that God would not be offended and would find it
 in his heart like the loving father that he was to allow the Path to remain,
 to guide his faithful servant on to his Holy destination, beyond all the
 hardships and dangers that might arise in his quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
For if it was a simple, sheltered matter, little would the Pilgrimage mean.
 Anyone would walk about the Holy Lands, especially the deceitful liars
 and archenemies of God and their followers; soiling the land and air with
 their mere breaths and their unclean feet, poisoning the very air with
 their hideous laughter and venomous lies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
No, it was not a simple affair walking through the Land of God.
 That was why the Pilgrim kept praying each and ever waking moment: to thank
 his God for his magnanimous and benevolent nature, thank him for allowing
 to draw breath and drink water when he needed to.
 He prayed to thank his God for allowing him to feast upon the fruit and
 the very life of His Land to keep his beating heart alive.
 The Pilgrim thanked God because he had been blessed enough to touch the
 Holy Soil with bare hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was almost dusk on the third day since he had set foot on the Land of
 God.
 It was once more time for prayer.
 He laid down his small sack and took off his cloak, setting it down in
 front of him.
 He then knelt on it and closed his eyes while his arms rested on his legs,
 the palms of his hands touching his knees.
 He then started bowing down low with his forehead touching the Path every
 time.
 Whispered words of reverence came out of his mouth in the tongue of God
 which they no longer used, but kept handing it down as holy passages, from
 mouth to mouth, generation to generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Though he could not understand what the words were saying, he could feel
 their perfection rippling through the air.
 Holy words spoken in the Land of God felt like a river mingling with the
 sea.
 It was as if a small trickle of divinity flowed through the essence of
 God made manifest; the air, earth and water resonating with godly purpose
 and sacrosanct silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hence His words, the Holy Mantra, which should be told aloud for all of
 Creation to bear witness to his grandeur and wisdom.
 In the Holy Land though, in His Land and His Domain, it would be sacrilege
 to utter these words in anything above a whisper.
 For every grain of sand, every wisp of air, and every drop of water carried
 everything back to him: voice, thought and deed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he bowed low in homage to the creation of God all around him he felt
 the striking of grandiose, majestic chords buried deep inside his very
 essence and soul.
 He felt pride in his heritage, his people, and his purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He cast it swiftly aside, knowing that pride was a double-edged blade, ready
 to cut into him right when next he would feel invincible, safe, powerful
 and righteous.
 That was not God's way; God taught humility, wisdom, faith, belief and
 love.
 Not pride, arrogance and lust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Holy Land was indeed a place to be wary.
 Even when paying homage to God, the ruinous ones could find a man's weakness
 and seep inside him, while he would have himself believe he was walking
 the True Path.
 The Path was not just a white, slick and unending road; it was a state
 of mind and soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He made the sign of God with his outstretched palms facing towards the falling
 suns.
 In the hazy distance, only the line of the dark crimson horizon could be
 identified with difficulty over the pale yellow and blue of the rising
 mist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He stood up on his two feet and wore his cloak, picking up his sack and
 setting off down the path once again.
 As the chilly night rushed to meet him, he thought he could see a figure
 like a mirror of himself walking on the road towards him.
 He squinted his eyes as he tried to make sense of what he was seeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was a man not very much unlike him, lean and not very tall, of a somewhat
 pale color.
 The man's stride seemed purposeful and if he had taken notice of the Pilgrim
 walking on the Path, he showed no sign of alarm, surprise or fear.
 It was as if he would not stop, as if he was nothing but a phantom, an
 apparition of the Holy Lands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Maybe it was an apparition that he was seeing.
 Stranger things had been heard around the life-stones during the coldest
 nights at his people's gatherings.
 It would not be without precedent that he should meet a ghost of the Holy
 Lands, perhaps some other Pilgrim before him who had wandered the Holy
 Lands and now roamed them freely, to warn the Pilgrims and the faithful
 and guide them through danger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps he was a messenger from God Himself; though it might have been presumptu
ous or even blasphemous to think that God would seek to aid him in such
 straightforward ways that completely and blatantly proved his Divine existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He reminded himself to be wary though; perhaps the pale man was a ruinous
 force in disguise, a servant of those that would always be evil, seeking
 to corrupt men and everything good and wholesome that the Pilgrim tried
 to protect from their rotting grasp and their insidious machinations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps, he was just a man though; even a believer like himself, brave enough
 to seek out God.
 He would soon find out whether he should strike him down or greet him like
 a brother should.
 The man had gotten quite close by now and he thought it prudent to make
 some sort of sign to announce himself properly, like a man in the Holy
 Land should greet another man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim stopped and stood firmly.
 He then made the sign of God, touching his bowed forehead with one straightened
 out palm and offering his other hand to showing his clear, empty palm.
 What the gesture meant to those familiar with it, those of pure mind and
 soul, was this: `I am a man blessed with God's gift, a mind of my own.
 I carry no weapon and greet you as a brother.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The man walking towards him slowed his pace, visibly trying to discern the
 gesture.
 Then he responded in kind, first with a deep bow towards the sinking suns
 and then made the same sign, albeit with the opposite hands, mirroring
 the Pilgrim's motion.
 `A true believer then, or some instrument of God,' the Pilgrim thought.
 His blessings were countless and his heart leaped with joy at such a sight.
 A brotherly soul right there, in the Land of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim smiled widely and picked up his pace to meet with his brother
 from afar.
 He could see the man coming towards him smile as well, his face lit up
 with enthusiasm and surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Under the faint light of the ever widening star-lit sky they met each other
 with faces visibly ridden with the signs of hardship only a believer would
 endure to prove his love of God, staying true to his faith.
 Brothers joined in belief, sharing the creation of God, walking on the
 Path.
 What joyous occasion such a meeting of brotherly souls was, and in the
 Holy Land no less!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were standing opposite each other and the man in front of him, the
 man whom he had seen walking up towards him was younger, leaner, and taller
 than he had glimpsed at first.
 In the light of dusk it was easy to misjudge the shape and size of things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The young man proffered his hand, and spoke a few words in a language that
 the Pilgrim didn't understand and had actually never heard of before in
 his life.
 The Pilgrim was thinking that the man in front of him must have uttered
 a greeting, or perhaps announced his name.
 He seemed friendly, unassuming and harmless.
 His heart weighed the man in front of him: `he might be speaking in weird
 tongues, but he made the sign of God.
 A brother under God is brother enough'.
 The Pilgrim closed his eyes and nodded with acceptance, hands outstretched
 to his left and right.
 The man spoke again:

 Perhaps some common thread could be found while they tried to converse

The Pilgrim look at him puzzled.
 His brother seemed as excited to meet him as he was, he could tell.

 He seemed to have forgotten about paying proper respect in the Holy Land;
 his voice rang loud and his expression was wild, his body intensely at
 motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Still, he could not understand a single word the man was saying, even though
 he seemed to have repeated a question of some sort at least once.
 `He might be asking where I'm coming from, or where I'm going,' the Pilgrim
 said to himself silently absorbed in thought.
 It was difficult to believe this was a messenger from God or one of his
 holy servants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He seemed like a long lost brother the language he spoke altogether different
 but with hints of the language of God.
 The Pilgrim hoped he was indeed a brother though this could always prove
 to be a trap, a wicked machination; an evil thing sent to thwart him and
 his Pilgrimage, to mock God and his divine plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would not allow himself to fall for such tricks of the soul, and his
 wary eye would be on the lookout for signs that would expose this man as
 a pawn of the archenemies.
 For now he would treat him as a brother and offer God his prayer, seeking
 forgiveness for thinking such accusing thoughts even in a time that should
 be joyous; for a brother he hoped, had been found.
 He smiled and motioned his hands to the sky his head slightly bowed and
 a thin but hearty smile on his lips, his voice ringing clear and true:

The Pilgrim made the sign of God once more and looked at the strange man
 he now considered a brother under God; he felt a bit saddened that his
 words could not be understood and could not answer his brother's questions.

Though he was starting to find some sounds common, the Pilgrim did not possess

 was wrong to be so wary of him.
 He had seen his brother offer his thanks to God and heard him say a single
 word clearly.
 The Pilgrim believed he could learn from his brother then, slowly.

He turned his mind inwards and reasoned with himself, thinking that maybe
 God had not sent this man to find him, but he had sent both of them to
 find each other.
 Fate was for God alone to decide and change, but he was thankful he would
 have a companion with him.
 For where else could this man walking on the True Path be going, other
 than to the Holy Grounds themselves? It was their journey now, the Pilgrim
 thought and then he smiled, carefully pronouncing each syllable slowly
 before bowing and once again pointing upwards:

The Pilgrim saw then his brother kneel down on the Path and offer his prayer

But he felt it in his heart that this man would become a true friend and

 The thought made the Pilgrim break down in laughter.
 He hadn't laughed at all since he had set out on his Pilgrimage.

His new brother looked at him in disbelief, somewhat dumbfounded; he kept

 The Pilgrim thought bitterly that his lack of reverence would have to be

 another two.
 But he felt it was worth it; such laughter must have been welling inside
 him for too long.
 It was a liberating experience, one that he felt did him good.

 never came that night to her, and her tears flowed freely.
 She stifled the worst of the sobs and moans that welled up from her insides,
 but still she wept.
 Come morning her face was that of a sad older woman, with eyelids swollen
 from the crying and the sleeplessness.
 She felt horrible and the child within her seemed equally disturbed.
 How could it not be, if its mother was in such a terrible state?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She had left her windows closed, the drapes and curtains tightly drawn shut.
 She cared not whether the suns had risen and a new day had dawned.
 She wept for her only love, the one half that matter most in the world.
 The other half, his own half as well, was stirring uneasily in her belly.
 She tried to think comforting thoughts but all she managed was to utter
 with a croak:

She wandered aimlessly around their home, every once in a while hugging
 herself as if vainly trying to land herself in Amonas' arms.
 But it was to no avail, for he could not appear out of thin air.
 And still she cried, at times silently with tears welling up in her eyes
 and at other times fitfully, with sobs that she could not contain released
 in languish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She pined for the father of her unborn child, to hold him and caress his
 face.
 To kiss her fears and troubles away.
 But he was not there.
 He was nowhere, it seemed.
 As if he had been spirited away, by the same sort of devils that had caught
 poor Philo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
No body had been found though, and no one had come for her or her child.
 Philo would never talk, he would never give up his blood brother, mentor,
 and friend.
 She suddenly felt a pang of fear in her heart as if it had been struck
 violently, nearly coming to a halt.
 Was the child safe with her? Did she need to run like the wind and the
 winter streams? Disappear like she had never existed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And what about Amonas? What had happened to her love? She could not for
 one second think of him as no more, as a dead body, limp and unmoving.
 He must be alive, somewhere.
 In hiding, running for his life.
 He had that other man with him.
 He would be running to protect him as well.
 That was why he hadn't come forward to her, or sent a message that he was
 well and alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It must have been a matter of secrecy.
 How tired she had grown of all these dark affairs, so many lies heaped
 upon lies.
 The lies they had sworn to break and burn away, those very lies were probably
 what kept them alive even now.
 What irony, to have had your life built around what you despised most.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was the only way, they had kept telling to themselves.
 The only way they could change things once and for all, the only way they
 could spread the truth and uncover the deceit that had blinded them all.
 And that was the way he was gone now, perhaps forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The dark thought contorted her face into a mixture of anger, pain, and weeping
 sorrow.
 She held her head in her palms, sobbing silently.
 She was constantly going through the same phases: Sorrow and then anger;
 then a faint sliver of hope would dawn upon her and recollect her thoughts,
 compose herself somewhat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And then fear would grip her once more, the uncertainty for her child sweeping
 everything clean, and the vicious circle of gripping emotions and harrowing
 memories of happier times would start anew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She would weep and cry, throwing herself against the walls until she could
 stand it no more; then she would think of her loved one that might be dead
 and might never kiss her again, never hold his child in his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The thought made her weep once more, all the tears of the world coursing
 down her cheeks like the torrent of pain and anguish that ran throughout
 every living thing swept through her soul.
 She would suffer like no other had suffered before and that would not stop
 until she either died herself, or saw her love calling her to his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The child stirred within as if it was calling out to her, as if fear had
 touched it deep inside, past the warmth of his mother's belly, and an icy
 chill had crept up all around it.
 She tried to soothe her child and in spite herself started to sing an ode
 to the streams and fields; a song of merry melody, a melody that would
 have Amonas smiling and laughing within moments.
 She would not cry at the thought, nor think him long gone.
 She would sing it in quiet waiting and strong hope.
 She would sing it for their child's sake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And so she did, and her voice echoed in her empty house which suddenly felt
 brighter, warm and full of charming smells like cinnamon and naristhel;
 lermentis leaves, honey-spice and mint.
 All those smells that brought the senses joy, and a smile on their face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The child felt quiet now; the singing had relieved it of its fear and brought
 back the warmth in its heart.
 It felt like it was asleep now, comfortable in its mother's womb who herself
 felt soothed, her fears cast away for the moment; her hope shining brighter
 and her heart beating with renewed vigor and hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Her mind was filled with thoughts: He would be alright, Amonas.
 He would be fighting or running all the way back to me, like the lovely
 fool he is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She strolled around the house for a while, thinking that she could no longer
 sit there idle and miserable.
 She had to find out what had happened, see for herself.
 After all, she felt it was not really safe sitting in their home anymore.
 Neither for her, nor for their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It sounded foolhardy and unnecessarily risky, her mind told her.
 But her mother's instinct shouted that she should run away to find another
 shelter.
 Somewhere where she might give birth in safety.
 She was due anytime soon and each day could be the day their child would
 be born.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Her condition made moving all the more difficult so she would require some
 assistance in her endeavor.
 She thought about moving out to the countryside, take what coin she could
 and find some good people, some family to take her in at least until she
 gave birth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But things were about to get hectic, she knew.
 Soon there would be very few people that she could trust.
 Amonas had chosen to keep her well away from the Kinsfolk; she had only
 met and knew Philo, who was supposed to be her guardian and protector should
 anything happen to Amonas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She had been frightened at the thought, but had accepted it as a realistic
 precaution.
 The irony now was that with Amonas missing, and her protector unable to
 come to her aid she would have to fend for herself.
 She thought: `Poor Philo, what horrible fate must await him at the hands
 of those tyrants?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She would have to turn to the Kinsfolk for their help.
 At this time of need with an uprising boiling right under her feet and
 the child almost on its way, what should she do? Run away, fearing for
 their lives everyday? Never knowing who to trust, with war raging throughout
 the Territories? No, she decided that that would be foolish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She might have been a fool in her own life, but that was before she was
 graced with Amonas' and her child; now she would give her all to protect
 it.
 This was her best bet then: find the kinsfolk before all of Pyr turned
 into a nightmare, and stay with them until it was ended and a new day dawned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
For better or for worse she would be amongst friends; free men and women,
 brothers and fellow believers in what was just and right.
 She felt like it was time to accept that there would be nowhere safer than
 right in the heart of things, from where the revolution was about to spring
 out like a restless fountain.
 A revolution overflowing with the tears of the downtrodden, the poor and
 the wretched; the ones that were made to disappear in the middle of the
 night, their cries haunting the streets like ghosts trapped in a hellish
 afterlife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The knowledge of the deeply rooted injustice of the tyrannical masterminds
 of the Ruling Council, the lies and deceit they spread through the ministers
 with the single purpose of breeding sterile and harmless minds like sheep,
 that knowledge alone had made her subscribe to Amonas' purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She saw the truth behind his words, behind every poor beggar and every blind
 soldier; behind every child that died of hunger and every old man that
 was hanged for blasphemy and sin.
 Such terrible things no God would allow if he had anything at all to do
 with the real world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Such reminiscence steeled her and made her finally decide.
 She would seek out the kinsfolk and join them, participate in any manner
 that she could.
 Not just for the safety of her unborn child, but for its future life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She knew then instinctively that Amonas would have been proud of her making
 such a decision.
 Not out of a childish conception of bravery and duty or a vainglorious
 attempt at posterity, but because she genuinely cared and actually hoped
 their child would grow up as a free person; not bound anymore, not a cripple
 in mind and soul, but a person free to build their own destiny, free from
 the oppression of the spirit, the misconceptions and the prejudice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A person that could think of his own and decide for himself would live in

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
If it was a boy, she thought to herself and smiled, she would like him to
 be like his father but not too much.
 She'd like him to carve his own destiny and raise a family of his own,
 set the example for those around him, be a man cherished and loved.
 He could be anything he'd want: an artist, a poet or a painter to put down
 on paper and canvas feelings, emotions and thoughts that none would have
 dared before him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He could be a man of reason and logic and make something useful out of things

 Perhaps think of new, exciting and purposeful things to make the lives

He knew from the bottom of her soul that her son would grow to be come a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She smiled at how she corrected her thoughts and bit her lip thinking what
 it would be like if the child was a girl.
 She would be born a free woman, and she would have all the time in the
 world to become whatever she wished for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She could become so many things that were unthinkable then, she thought.
 She could become the thinker and the tinkerer in the family, and then a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
These thoughts of merry prospect brought her glee and her face shone.
 She could not wait for Amonas' to return.
 She now felt it would be impossible for him to miss the birth of his firstborn.
 She would tell him all about her plans when they met again.
 After she had smothered him with kisses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
`But first things first,' she said to herself.
 That blessed reunion would have to wait.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She picked up a rather small sack, and carefully put inside some things
 she would either need or would miss terribly.
 Some letters from Amonas that would also serve as proof he was her husband,
 if the need for that ever arose.
 Celia also took the flute he had carved for her which she played to him
 on the colder nights, the both of them wrapped together under heavy sheets,
 playing endlessly until the break of dawn; making love without a care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She packed a few clothes along with her nightgown and a blanket or two in
 case she had to spent a few nights on the road.
 She took some leftover bread-pie from yesterday with her, and remembered
 to fill a flask of water from the well before she would be off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It would be best not to tell anyone, not even dear Rovenia.
 It would do her no amount of good to upset her and make her worry without
 being able to help in any way.
 Once she was gone, it would not be long before the revolution proper began;
 then no one would be safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Her small sack was packed to the brim, ready to burst.
 Outside, dusk was falling but she would wait for the night sky to appear.
 It would be easier then for her to find the men she was looking for.
 She would try some of the places they had met with Philo, certain inns
 and some artisan's stalls that stayed open past the usual times, in some
 of the ill-reputed corners of the market.
 As an afterthought she took her large kitchen knife, just for good measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She might not look like it with a bloated belly and all that came with expecting
 a child, but she could move real fast.
 A dancer, a really good dancer like she was, has certain qualities that
 can be put to more than one use.
 Her mind wandered briefly to a particularly fond memory involving Amonas,
 and she giggled in spite herself like an adolescent, infatuated girl.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Oh, he would be back and she would scold him properly for leaving her alone
 like that, she thought.
 She heard her voice in her mind: `A pregnant woman mere days before being
 due, a world-shattering uprising in the works, and the husband off on a
 tour!'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Then she suddenly broke down in tears, the tension that had kept her going
 suddenly released.
 The fear and uncertainty did not return as she had expected, but she felt
 like slapping herself for trying to lose herself in forgetfulness and act
 is if nothing serious was happening.
 Things were not like she could be all play and games when she saw him again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She composed herself and stopped crying and let the tears down her cheek
 run dry.
 This was all deadly serious, she knew.
 She knew for a fact that Amonas might be dead.
 She knew it in her heart though that he wasn't; it was just that life could
 be so full of surprises, and most of them unpleasant.
 So she turned her heart into ice and gave the macabre thought some consideratio
n.
 That only made her cold and distant from her usual self.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
At that moment she vowed on her life, and the life of her child: she vowed
 to fight in any manner or way possible for the future freedom of her child,
 and if it turned out to be so, in memory of her loving husband, Amonas
 Ptolemy; to honor his legacy and offspring, as he would have wanted so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Time passed slowly, and she grasped the opportunity to have a last look
 around their house.
 She looked in their bedroom where he had loved her with passion and care.
 Sometimes he was a strong lover: unyielding, discovering every inch of
 her body with a conqueror's lust.
 Other times, he was soft, mellow, caring and delicate; like the gentle
 breeze that caresses the flowers and meadows and flows freely wherever
 it pleases, always welcome to enter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was here where their child was conceived.
 It must have been one of the coldest nights, when he took her under the
 sheets and made her forget the world existed, in such a way that she could
 not remember now whether it was truth or fantasy.
 The child in her womb though was real enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She was caressing her belly absent-mindedly when she walked through her
 kitchen, the wood stove unlit, the fireplace glum and silent.
 It was as if the room itself mourned her leaving.
 She would miss preparing their meals with loving warmth, making sure there
 was always uwe on the table in one way or another.
 `Amonas

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She had been quietly absorbed in thought, her gaze fixed to nowhere in particula

 Night had finally fallen.
 It was time she left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She lit up a single candle in their bedroom at their window sill, as if
 in memory of the time they had spent together.
 She gathered her small sack and went outside careful to close the door
 forever behind her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She noticed lady Rovenia must have been outside, because she could see no
 candlelight from within.
 Perhaps she was already asleep; early to rise, early to bed.
 She thought she should have said goodbye, but it might have been just as
 well in the end.
 Her love went out to her as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Soon she was mingling with the night crowds of Pyr; common pyres lit up
 the streets and the more lively parts of the market.
 One could find anything he desired in the market of Pyr, as long as one
 searched hard enough in the right places; that much she knew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
On her way to one of the inns, she noticed she was attracting unwanted attention
; surely it seemed that a pregnant woman should not be walking outside in
 the market all alone.
 She should have thought to somehow cover her belly to accommodate for its
 shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All she could really do now was try and stay in the shadows.
 With one hand she clutched her sack over her back, and with the other her
 solid kitchen knife hidden in inside her dress.
 She felt ready for violence, but she dearly hoped it wouldn't come to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Wading through the crowds, she reached one of the inns Amonas had once said
 were more than sympathetic to their cause.
 It was one of the few places she had seen Philo in public.
 When she did so it was indeed more of a social gathering; a man meeting
 a friend, escorted by his wife.

Those who did not return to their drinks and kept on pointing with some

Celia nodded her acceptance, and noticed they had now reached a crossroads
 of tunnels.
 Rewe then used the torch as some sort of knocking apparatus.
 He used it to knock on what seemed to be finely cut limestone, in a series
 of rhythmic knocks using pauses in between, as if playing part of a tune.
 She rightly guessed it was some kind of code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Indeed, a strange kind of challenge echoed backs a series of knocks from
 the other side of the limestone.
 Rewe seemed to pause for a while, and then proceeded with a different series
 of knocks.
 The limestone slab was slowly pushed aside and strong candle light filled
 the underground tunnels.
 A small simple wooden ladder was lowered, and Rewe motioned Celia to climb
 it.
 Silently, he bowed and waved her goodbye before losing himself back the
 way they had come.
 Celia squinted at the bright light as she came up the stairs, onto what
 seemed to be a very plush kind of cellar, with exquisite bronze and silver
 decorations on the walls.
 A whole wall was devoted to a grand collection of what seemed to be wine
 bottles.
 A young man dressed in simple manservant's clothes greeted her, bowing
 and saying:

Celia nodded her thanks and the man went up a small staircase briskly.
 She was in a cellar once more, from what she could gather.
 But it was a much different cellar alltogether; it looked older and much
 better cared for.
 It was much larger, and though she was not an expert in wines, from the
 little she knew she could see the owner of the cellar had fine and expensive
 taste.
 There were even Feuillout bottles to be found.
 And there was a manservant on duty here almost at all times, it would seem.
 She was in no ordinary tavern or house.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As her mind tried to orientate herself, a smiling old man in a luxurious
 servant's suit complete with velvet vest came down the stairs to greet
 her.
 He seemed a rather upstanding and polite man who helped her make the last
 steps up the stairs, offering his hands as support.
 She looked rather mystified and as she was ready to ask the venerable servant
 where she was exactly, his long experience and hard years of service prompted
 him to greet her before she had time to open her mouth:

Personnel manifests, rotation forecasts, matériel inventories, requisition

 workshop and mill necessitation orders, movement and guard formations,

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All of these types of documents had to reviewed and amended if needed.
 They had to be edited, signed, and forwarded; then signed again and scribed,
 before sent out in a seemingly never-ending vicious cycle of bureaucracy
 and stale ministry procedures that were designed to triple check and record
 everything that went on.
 The idea behind all that trouble was making sure that nothing seemed to
 stray in weird and unexplored territory, something that would alarm the
 various ministry officials and by natural order the Arch-minister himself.
\end_layout

All this paperwork and mind-boggling interdepartmental anarchy had the general

 resembled a carpet of ink and white that made his head dizzy merely by
 looking at it, much less reading it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He leaned over and put his elbows on the desk to rest his head on his hands,
 gently massaging it as if that would make the terrible headache go away.
 The latest developments had had him thinking about his career in the army

 He almost wished he could somehow go back in time and fail at pretty much
 everything so he could get Gomermont's job for a change.
\end_layout

Instead he leaned again back on his chair, the muscles in his back stiff
 from constantly sitting, signing documents since early dawn.
 His wrist hurt like he had been practicing with a sword since the day before.
 He looked at the plain and unadorned ceiling with eyes out of focus, and
 seemed to ponder deeply the state of affairs he was in.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The army had been metaphorically, though almost literally at times, handcuffed

 its inception and creation.
 The hindrances and bureaucratic steps that were constantly arrayed against
 the army and its people were designed in such a way as to extend the period
 of time it takes for troops to assemble, equip and move, from days onto
 weeks.

Even with the help from the Arch-minister that had indeed expedited some

 Everything had to sift through the gargantuan train of Ministry processes,

 not always most likely, make something useful and tangible in the end.

The more he thought about it the more incredulous it all seemed, but it

 Just the other day, he remembered, he had received a notice of an annulled
 material request for a shipment of chisels required for the maintenance

 The ministry's reasoning behind the annulment was mystifying at best:

It seemed the ministry was contemplating whether or not a military coup

 bows, steamers, slingshots, siege engines and the good old knives it already
 possessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Their lack of trust was crippling.
 He was given a colossal task that was daily compounded with the burden
 of the ministry's schizophrenic tendencies that balanced precariously between
 gross, outright denial and a maniacal urge to have everything done and
 ready, armed merely with ink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The arch-minister had been quite unable to help, since this was pretty much
 how everything worked in the ministry.
 Reiterating the jumbling mass of ministry people to adopt new sound practices
 in a matter of days was just as inconceivable as totally circumventing
 the antiquated ministry machine in whole.
 In essence, Tyrpledge was caught between a hammer and an anvil.
 With nowhere else to go, he knew he would have to endure as the good soldier
 he was.
 He could feel the pressure though, and it was rising to a crushing level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He got up from his office and decided to have a little stroll outside.
 Maybe some fresh air would invigorate him.
 As he made to leave his office, his aide-de-camp and various other officers
 belonging to his immediate staff saluted crisply, most of them with papers
 and ink in hand, designated to handle some of the bureaucracy whose scale
 defied that of the legendary behemoths of the sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

He left orders for his aide-de-camp that he was not to be disturbed or communica

 Anything that might come up it would have to wait for him, and not the
 other way around.

He might not have a vote on the Council, but he didn't like being pushed
 around like a junior officer after 45 years of humble and devoted service.
 It felt wrong, that was the word that best described his feelings.
 Plain wrong.
 He reached for someone else's mug of fresh uwe and without a nod or excuse
 just picked it up and went outside in the clear cold air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He looked casually over the throngs of artisans, laborers and soldiers going
 about their frantic work.
 The artisans were terribly busy constructing breakable, portable siege
 engines, refurbishing and testing the steamers that had fallen in prolonged
 disuse.
 Even with the sudden influx of forced skilled and unskilled labor, he could
 easily discern they had already fallen behind schedule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In the background to the main staging area of the army, laborers were hard
 at work ferrying ore from the nearby Ilo and Rohms mines.
 The mines were working at full capacity non-stop, but the noble families
 that were allowed to operate the mines were failing to reach the needed
 production quotas.
 Already, procrastinators had teamed up with squads of army men that were
 instructed to gang-press as many people as needed to meet the allottment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There were less than ten days left before the army was expected to march
 fully armed with the maximum strength of trained men.
 There were still thousands of weapons and pieces of armor to be made, which
 meant more and more ore was required each day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Forges had been setup right there in the staging area, but artisans were
 already starting to break down from exhaustion.
 Work had been issued to forges and workshops around the Territories, and
 failure to meet the quota assigned to each would be punished by death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The same went for the grand fields of noble families.
 It was reported that even the Lords themselves, the heads of the families,
 were working their own fields; busy to harvest as much grain, wheat and
 fitlle as possible however premature the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The whole of the Territories was living and breathing in preparation of
 the army - everything else had come to a standstill.
 Mills had broken down from excessive speed while grinding incessantly,
 day and night.
 Rumors of some of them catching on fire trying to meet the demand could
 not be far from the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Horses and tract animals of all kinds like cows and donkeys were being taken
 forcibly from their masters, in most cases the sole animal in their possession
 to work the lands and make a living with.
 Huge convoys that stretched from one side of a town to the other were being
 created by local procrastinator forces and went about the countryside,
 picking up whatever it was on their ministry-approved lists to fill up
 cart after cart of supplies and materials for the army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All of that wealth was congregated and amassed in even larger convoys that
 stretched as far as the eye could see, filling up the few roads that carts
 could traverse.
 Some of them had already started arriving at Pyr and the staging area which
 was a huge stretch of land to the south of the City, where once the harbor
 of Urfalli had lain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The harbor had been made anew and ships from the farther reaches of the
 Territories would begin arriving in the next couple of days, and like the
 cart convoys would be laden to the brim with supplies and men, flirting
 with disaster from being overweight and prone to sinking should they happen
 upon bad weather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Procrastinators around the lands with the authority of the ministers rounded
 up men of all ages that were fit for duty; those who had received military

 not tell the pointed tip of a spear from a moose's behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was all happening too fast for comfort, too hastily for any serious preparati

 little time.
 The people under his command, from the high-ranked officers, the colonels
 and brigadiers, to the lowly green recruit, would not have enough time
 to prepare and get their bearings, get to know what their purpose, their
 orders and responsibilities would be.
 At times, he wondered if he himself really knew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He hoped that he could put it all together in time; failing to do that would
 mean his head.
 He thought about that possibility and curiously enough it did not seem
 to frighten or trouble him, not in the sense it would most people.
 Losing his head would be more than unpleasant, but he had a long time ago
 accepted that it would be asked of him at some point, sooner or later,
 to give up his life for the glory of the Gods and the Castigator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It had just never occurred to him that such a time would come rather later
 in his career, right before he would be about to be rotated to an easier
 life of teaching young aspiring officers.
 It definitely had not occurred to him that his death might not come at
 the hands of an enemy by spear, sword, rock, arrow or fire, but because
 of failing to meet production quotas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps it would more specifically boil down to a lack of chisels.
 The thought brought a bitter smile to his lips, and he sniggered with a
 dark sense of amusement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He wished he could have a smoke then; a nice pipe-blend of uwe, keplis and
 dark tobacco, but he had given up on the habit a long time ago and now
 lacked all the assorted paraphernalia, as well as any tobacco to speak
 of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He thought that perhaps one of his officers would be so kind as to volunteer
 a pouch and a pipe.
 If it came to that, he would order him to do so.
 Thinking like a brash cadet once more made him grin while he sipped a hearty
 mouthful of uwe from the cup he had confiscated with authority from one
 of the desks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It tasted horribly.
 Some idiot had let the uwe leaves boil along with the water and the result
 was a putrid-like green broth fit only for mules and perhaps sailors.
 He threw away the cup altogether and headed back to his office, his head
 much more clearer but his mood equally if not more glum than before.
 He made a mental note to himself to reprimand the one responsible for the
 awful uwe tea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once he entered the planning chamber which was filled with his officers
 he immediately noticed it was completely silent and everyone inside was
 firmly standing to attention.
 He believed he had given orders that with such hectic work going on, discipline

 He couldn't have everyone standing stiff as a corpse every waking minute,

The general nodded, bowed, and went for the door himself.
 The Castigator walked outside and Tyrpledge followed close behind, careful

\begin_layout Standard

The Castigator was keeping his hands tied behind his back, surveying the
 landscape.
 It seemed as if he was enjoying the cold wisps of air sweeping in from
 the south, almost craning his neck in what seemed like an effort to smell
 the sea breeze.

After a small period of time spent taking in the scenery as if he were nothing
 but a visiting tourist the Castigator spoke, turning to address the general
 face to face.
 His hair was slightly ruffled by the gusts of air that were quite common
 this time of year in Urfalli and were good for ship-running as well as
 working the mills.
 He said to Tyrpledge:

Tell me General.
 Skip the formalities please, and tell me what you really think about all
 this.
 This campaign.
 It's put a lot of strain on you and your people, hasn't it? And you'd have
 to be a gibbering idiot like the Procrastinator Militant not to question
 my motives for such an operation.
 Who wouldn't want to know what he's going up against, isn't that true?
 Please, Tyrpledge.
 Be unpleasant if you have to be honest.
 I do not consider myself a man easily taken by petty flattery, and neither
 should you.

Tyrpledge felt a bit surprised, perhaps even shocked from such a straightforward
 manner.
 It was strange enough when the Arch-minister came to him and extended somewhat
 of a professional courtesy towards him.
 It was more than strange that the Castigator himself of all people, would
 be so direct in his approach.
 It probably meant things were about to get all too serious pretty soon.
 His voice was straight and professional, perhaps a bit sullen when he replied:

True enough, sire.
 I'm blindly preparing for any scenario and contingency I can think of,
 working everyone to near-exhaustion to have as much as possible ready within
 the allotted time.
 If I may say so, the extend of the mobilization you have requested is simply
 overwhelming.
 There may be a possibility that we will not be ready in time, sire.
 Not completely, not fully.
 I can guarantee a bare minimum of a well-equipped, well-trained and disciplined
 fighting force, but I cannot do the same for the full weight of our armies.
 We are still receiving conscripts and draftees from the villages and towns,
 people that have only worked with shovel, pickax and hoe.
 We need more time, sire.
 Or we will not be able to field our maximum numbers.

 woke up feeling refreshed.
 He sat up and flexed his arms and legs, all the time his gaze towards the
 direction of the bullhorns.
 It had been a more than pleasant change to find themselves under the shadow
 of the immense structure that seemed to blot out the suns quite effectively,
 making the whole area have a different feeling all together.
\end_layout

The one thing they noticed almost immediately was the different climate.
 Instead of the scorching heat and sticky moisture, they felt they could
 have actually been back in their own world during a hot summer overcast
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The heat was much more sensible, and their sleep had felt much more relaxing
 and refreshing than before.
 The moisture was still a bother, but it was not as aggravating as before.
 And there was no night time to worry about the chilly wetness that would
 brew through their bones.
 It was an almost pleasant, almost comfortable climate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even the vegetation seemed to be somewhat different.
 The trees for one thing were visibly smaller, and the canopy above them
 evidently thinner.
 Even though the shadow let less light through, the canopy was thinner and
 let even more of it through.
 Lighting conditions were about the same as before: a twilight of sorts
 that though eerie at times, did not put a strain on the eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The greenery was still lush but it looked as if it had shrank a notch; the
 leaves were smaller and thinner while the stems resembled those in normal
 plants instead of the monstrously thick greens they were starting to get
 used to.
 There was less rotting vegetation on the ground and a lot fewer dropped
 leaves.
 It almost felt like a weird forest that could have been somewhere on one
 of the far away lands of the Territories, like the south where it was said
 plants like no other grew.

Amonas decided not to go for a little exploratory walk as he had done so
 before, so as not to alarm Hilderich a second time.
 Now that they were in the bullhorn's shadow he knew they were on the right
 track and all they had to do was keep going in the same direction.
 It seemed only a small matter of time before they'd reach the huge structure
 proper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would have to worry about what they would actually do only when they
 got there.
 For now, he was more than content to feel a gentle rush of air which was
 quite a novelty in contrast to the non-existent wind in the sunlit parts
 of this place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Water was an issue but Amonas thought they could rely on that strange hard-skinn
ed fruit with the sweet watery juice inside.
 He could see clusters of the trees that bore it at various distances, and
 a nearby tree had even shed some of its fruit of its own volition.
 Amonas thought they would probably be most ripe and quite sweet, if trees
 worked like they did back home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The word 'home' even though only uttered in his mind brought his thoughts
 to a halt.
 He looked at the ground reflectively with a fleeting sadness worn on his
 face.
 It was not just that he longed to see Celia again, even though they had
 not been apart for more than a week:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was the worrisome feeling of being unable to protect her that wore him
 down.
 He had told his kinsfolk to keep their distance from her, even if something
 happened to him and he would be unable to be there for her.
 More so, especially if something happened to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As luck had brought things about he was far away and out of reach, with
 no means to communicate that he still drew breath.
 His people would probably think him dead, or at the very least running

With each passing day without hint of him, without a message of some sort,

If he was being kept alive, reason would dictate that they'd somehow manage

He was just one man after all.
 He would not hold it against them if they already believed him dead, drowned
 at the bottom of a lake or butchered and fed to wild boars or roaming dogs.
 They had seen it happen before, they all knew the dangers and the ignominious
 ways the Patriarch and the Castigator chose to dispose of their enemies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But he could not bear the thought of lovely Celia thinking him forever lost,
 never there to return her trusting gaze, never more to hold her when the
 nights were cold.
 He wondered then, how did she take the news? What did she make of them?
 Was she drowned in sorrow, was her spirit broken?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He never thought of her as a fragile thing, a snowflake that melt by touch
 alone.
 She was not a little woman or a hapless gal.
 She never did mind her own business, and she always spoke her mind.
 She was proud of her accomplishments, and knew her strengths and weaknesses
 well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
That was though what he feared most.
 He was one of her few weaknesses, now that he was gone.
 He felt a knot in his stomach at the thought of her giving up, burying
 him in that little ritual they buried their dead kinsfolk with no body
 to say her farewells too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He could picture her dancing to the tune of a weeping song in his memory,
 and then losing herself in the hills and fields, roaming the lands like
 a ghost of her own self.
 Until her days became unbearable; until the thoughts and memories crushed
 her like a millstone crushes seeds, grinding them to oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
No, he thought with a sparkle erupting in his heart and his gaze shooting
 upwards through the canopy toward the uncaring, seamless sky.
 She was with child, she would try and burn the world itself before anything
 happened to their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She would come through this, she would endure.
 Even if the thought of his death weighted her down, she would find a way
 to use it as a focus.
 She might even go as far as to think of avenging him.
 She was a fierce woman, he knew.
 She would be a terrible force to behold indeed; mother to a newborn, grieving
 wife to the man that meant the world to her.
 He would definitely not want to get in her way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The thought made him grin with a sense of pride and amazement, as well as
 renewed optimism.
 He told himself in his mind that since she would be fine, he had no reason
 not to do as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He decided to rouse himself into action, and started off towards the fallen
 hard-skinned fruit he had glimpsed earlier, when a sound like a man desperately
 gasping for air mixed with what reminded him of creaking wooden hulls of
 ships made him pause in his stride and turn around to meet the source of
 the cacophony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was Hilderich and nothing more, awaking with a clatter and a show that
 Amonas had never thought possible even more so in their current circumstances,
 without even a blanket in hand.
 Still, Hilderich somehow managed to give off the impression of someone
 who had been very violently and quite against his wishes woken during a
 lusciously promising dream after a night of heavy drinking.
 And all that with nothing but soil and fallen leaves under him to call
 a mattress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas waved a hand and boosted his voice just for good measure before asking:

Hilderich yawned with his mouth forming an impossible angle.
 For just a moment Amonas thought his jaws would fall out of place and his
 skin would snap in horrible ways, blood and bone spurting forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Thankfully that did not come to pass but he was still mesmerized by the
 way Hilderich's mouth could stretch.
 He still didn't know the young curator as much as he wanted to, but he
 had seen enough to know that he was a indeed a man full of surprises.
 It's not that he didn't trust him or that he felt wary of him.
 It was just that he made him go wide-eyed with shock and surprise at the
 most curious of places.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With that, Amonas picked up a brisk pace and walked off into the distance,
 not needing to hack his way through the much less denser vegetation.
 Hilderich languidly got up, his gaze flicking all around him, looking for
 an inviting bush or hopefully a bunch of fallen branches somewhere nearby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He rested his hands on his waist and surveyed the landscape around him.
 He would inevitably have to engage in a wider search than merely browse
 just by standing in one place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
So he set off as well into the direction of what looked like a promising
 cluster of older-looking trees, their barks craggy and laden with moss,
 happily whistling a tune he could not possibly remember what it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas seemed to be well-versed in surviving skills and at ease with finding
 his way through this remarkably chaotic mess of a forest.
 Hilderich on the other hand knew his own limitations in orientation, an
 ability which had failed him more than once even in the simple confines
 of his master's curatorium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
So he used what he thought was a quite practical way of keeping track of
 his whereabouts: he took off his cloak and cloth shirt and hanged the white
 linen shirt on a tall yet thin green stalk; he decided he would stray only
 as far as he could keep an eye on his shirt.
 Unless he went blind or some mysterious lurking thief of the wild came
 along and stole his shirt, he felt safe enough to wander away in search
 of some hopefully less than soggy firewood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When Amonas came back with his sack filled with various edibles, he was
 surprised to see Hilderich naked from the waist up sitting next to a few
 piles of wooden branches and bulkier logs sorted by size as far as he could
 tell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was sitting down on the ground idly with his back propped up against
 the trunk of a tree, legs sprawled nonchalantly.
 He looked expectantly at Amonas sack and said in a casual manner:

When it was time to move on again their hearts, especially Hilderich's,
 were not in it.
 The pleasant environment in combination with their full stomachs was a
 major disincentive to even stand up and stretch, much less start hiking
 again in a brisk pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even though the ground was totally flat and the only variations in height
 came deceivingly from the various degrees of thickness in vegetation, it
 was still an activity that required some degree of energy and patience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In any case, all their energy now seemed to be drained from the need to
 digest.
 They had indeed enjoyed a small feast: brown nuts, some other green horn-shaped
 fruit with soft sweet flesh, as well as something that resembled wheat
 in taste and form, but was over-sized and purple in color.
 Then there was another kind of crisp fruit with red flesh on the inside,
 wonderfully juicy and marvelously mellow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With Hilderich displaying genuine culinary audacity mixing various fruit-stuffs
 together and roasting them in small leaf parcels, they had indeed made
 the best of what Amonas had come up with, which was surprisingly and thankfully
, quite a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas had joked about how sorry he was for having been unable to find the
 pack of boars for which the piles of wood had seemed to have been amassed.
 Hilderich had insisted that Amonas had been gone for quite some time and
 it was perfectly logical that having nothing much else to do, he would
 have kept picking up more wood if he hadn't felt stiff by the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They seemed to have thought about it and decided it would be better for
 them to let their stomachs do some work first before they set off, so they
 talked at length, something which in the short time they had known each
 other they had not found ample opportunity for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
So they lied down around the embers of the fire with hands behind their
 heads, comfortably peering through the canopy of the forest wherever they
 could, invariably seeing not a wisp of a cloud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich talked about his curator's apprenticeship and master Olom.
 Amonas shared his memories from a time that seemed remote now, when master
 Olom was a close visiting friend of his father's; a time when Olom had
 not become shunned by most of his peers and practically forced to live
 as a recluse and a hermit, rather than an esteemed member of the Curatoria
 Prefecta.
 He also talked to Hilderich about how him and Olom united their efforts
 with the same purpose of liberating the people first from ignorance and
 then from the dogmatic yoke of the oppressing Ruling Council, relaying
 to him how bright and hopeful those times had seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas took some more time trying to make Hilderich picture what he had
 seen when he had stepped through the pillar of light and came back to tell
 the tale.
 He hoped Hilderich would understand the significance of that accursed place
 better than he could.
 Unfortunately, Hilderich seemed to be almost as much at a loss as Amonas
 was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All he could make of everything was that there was much more behind the
 Ruling Council than their rule of tyranny and oppressive dogma, something
 which eluded him still.
 Hilderich believed what Amonas had seen was open to many interpretations,
 all of them though bleak and chilling to think of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In the end he seemed to agree that if nothing else, his master's demise
 and their current predicament had shown him that nothing's well with the
 Territories and indeed the bases of their society were rotten to the core.
 Hidden artifacts beneath the Disciplinarium, curators being killed or driven
 away as if in a purge.
 Hilderich truthfully told Amonas that he didn't know if he believed everything
 he had been saying, but he now believed little of what he had learned growing
 up, and that was enough to side with him not only in their quest to return
 home, but also to uncover what lay beneath all the lies he had been fed.
 He was living on a strange new world; what more proof did he need that
 the Law was a lie, and if not a lie and simply in error, what then of its
 divine and infallible nature? All was not well in their world, and Gods
 were not in the heavens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas had been heartened to know Hilderich had changed his mind to see
 truth on his own.
 But their talk was brooding and soon became a blemish in their mood.
 He promptly changed the subject back to the happier times in their lives,
 and told Hilderich certain anecdotes about his late master that he might
 have been too self-conscious to admit himself.
 Hilderich had then been surprised to know that Olom was in fact a gin connoisse
ur and Amonas even remembered he had brought a distill of his own as a gift
 once.
 Hilderich somehow thought better of the old man now, though saving his
 life as he did seemed to have been reason enough to respect him immensely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich asked Amonas politely about Celia, having seen him reading some
 of her letters; Amonas was somehow reticent to talk about her intimately
 though.
 He apologized to Hilderich saying that it was not an appropriate time for
 such a discussion, but promised him that he would be more than happy to
 introduce her to Hilderich when they both got back and had left this sordid
 affair behind them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
After a time period of grace that Amonas seemed to be less than averse to
 and once they both felt they could do so without pain and anguish from
 bellies about to burst open, they started off towards what Amonas had declared
 to be the proper direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Soon Amonas was showing signs of uneasiness, stopping every once in a while
 and trying to feel the brush of air.
 He craned his neck as if the air had a strange scent about it, something
 intangible but yet evident all around them.
 Hilderich could not smell anything out of the ordinary or feel something
 out of place.
 He noticed though at some point while they were walking a tingling sensation,
 some of the hair in his back and hands rising as if a chill had settled
 in.

At length, even with their slowed down pace and their almost paranoid wariness
 wearing them down they finally reached the base of the bullhorns.
 They could visibly tell because the vegetation thinned out to small bushes
 and insignificant groves abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In the hazy background they could indeed see a wall of sorts engulfing their
 field of vision.
 Once they were past the last few trees and plants, a trench of sorts lay
 there; it was mossy but clearly man-made with clear-cut lines and angles
 defining it, not deeper than the height of a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Beyond the trench was where the bullhorns' front face dominated the view,
 defying the senses in a manner none of them thought possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was indeed a gigantic thing, blocking out the suns with ease.
 To their left and right, all they could see was the front face of the bullhorns
 for what seemed to be almost miles.
 The horizon was almost incapable of containing its view, an immaculate
 black mat wall with the appearance of obsidian.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It seemed to be shaped like a huge mount, wider at the base and narrow on
 top, like a solid triangle of sorts; a tetrahedron master Olom would call
 it, Hilderich thought.
 On a second thought the term 'pyramid' popped in his head, seemingly the
 right word for what they were seeing.
 The characteristically huge horn-like towers on the top seemed to be what
 distanced it from the shape of a pyramid.
 It seemed as if it was painstakingly constructed of large bricks or blocks
 of whatever material it was built from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The wall face rose with a small inclination, the blocks forming steps that
 seemed to be possible to climb with some difficulty because of their dimensions.
 The huge horns could be seen further higher and farther away, sitting majestica
lly atop a tall summit that could easily be as high as any mountain of the
 outer Territories.

Hilderich seemed troubled, perhaps a bit scared as well.
 Amonas thought it was to be expected and perhaps even wise considering

 You're a curator, so where is your analytical thinking? How do you know
 it's made of stone? You said megalithic.
 If it was made of obsidian, it would at least have some shiny quality to

Amonas' voice was mockingly serious; he wanted to relax Hilderich's doubts

 assortment of insecure comments, defeatist thoughts, and morose attitude.

Amonas held out both of his hands and touched the block of stone that stood
 right in front of him on the first row of steps leading to the bullhorns'

 Nothing happened.
 Amonas smiled to Hilderich disarmingly, to which Hilderich nodded unenthusiasti

Now that the walls are safe, what do you think we should do? Any thoughts

 climb up to the summit, to where the bullhorns are?

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas had pretty much laid out their options quite concisely at that point,

 recently grown beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Walking around it would take a couple of days, my guess is.
 We'd be searching for something we assume might exist but cannot be certain.
 I don't know.
 The other thing that bothers me is that this wall face is shadowed, but
 the others can't possibly be.
 That means we would be scorched dry with all that sun and nothing much
 in the way of making ourselves some shade.
 So, I have to conclude that the only viable course of action at this point
 is indeed to climb up the summit.
 We could try and search this wall from edge to edge, but I don't know what
 might come of it.
 Quite possibly nothing.
 Whoever built this thing would be indeed quite an eccentric if any door
 would be cryptically lying in an obscure, random position.
 But that's just my guess, and not a very educated one.
 All I have to base my conjectures upon is rudimentary knowledge of common
 practices and some plain old good sense.
 But all that's based on a different world.

 It seems to be connected to the bullhorns.

And with that last remark, once Hilderich had folded his cloak neatly Amonas
 began their long, effortful climb up the steps of the bullhorn's base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The large jet black blocks, though cleanly cut and smoothly finished as
 if from fine porcelain, offered enough friction for a man unused to climbing
 to be able to push himself upwards.
 Hilderich felt it was somewhat like reaching for the top shelf of a cupboard.
 Child's play then, he thought, only somewhat much more taxing on the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Indeed only after a little more than a hundred steps Hilderich felt cramps
 and stiffness overtaking his aching body, especially the legs where he
 put much of his strength to propel himself upwards on the steps that seemed
 fit only for giants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas noticed and motioned for Hilderich to take a breath for a while to
 relax his muscles and stretch.
 Hilderich's lungs were starting to burn but he didn't complain, just as
 long as they'd made some progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He peered over at the landscape stretching behind them trying to make out
 where they had originally arrived, where they started their trek from,
 but he was unable.
 It all looked uniformly green and jarring, trees after trees after trees,
 a green sea under the pale blue suns.
 Amonas was standing a few steps above and behind Hilderich, looking thoughtfull
y below.
 While Hilderich was stretching with feet dangling over the steps below,
 he said with a hint of worry in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You know, I counted the steps up so far.
 You seem to be jaded.
 I cannot say I'm not tired either.
 The problem is I've counted one hundred and seventeen steps.
 If you look at the summit does it look any closer to you?

 at them, but rather looking at Hilderich.

Uhm..

Yes we are.
 I don't know if we should go back down and forage some more before coming

Luckily for you I've kept a brown one and a couple of those horn-shaped
 soft-flesh fruit.
 They should do until then, with a little bit of economy on our part.
 I dread to think I'd climb up this monster so I would have to go back and
 forth each time I felt hungry or thirsty.
 And after all, if there's nothing important up there, something like that
 pillar of light that brought us here, then we'd be stuck here, wouldn't
 we? We'd have all the time in the world to go searching for new exotic
 fruit then, I wouldn't worry.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich's tone was ironic, even caustic, but Amonas thought bitterly that
 he was right.
 If their climb did not bring them closer to home, then nothing else would.
 At least not in any foreseeable future.
 He wouldn't have to worry about provisions then.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And so they started off to the summit prepared only to stop for some breath
 and relaxation, careful not to push their bodies beyond their limits.
 They climbed slowly but steadily, sweat pouring from the pores in their
 skin.
 The higher they went the more they could feel the wind; sometimes a gentle
 breeze, other times a rough gale.
 The warmth of the air varied; sometimes it was as hot as it was below on
 the ground and at other times as chilly as they had never felt it before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They stopped when they needed to, and moved on when they felt their legs
 and lungs could go on.
 But the higher they went and the more time passed, it became more and more
 difficult to climb and their pace dropped considerably with their pauses
 becoming increasingly frequent and more prolonged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But they had made good progress in the time they had been climbing.
 They could see the horns clearly now rising as majestically as ever, indeed
 towering over them and dominating the sky above.
 But they had still some way to go before they reached the summit proper,
 and those last few steps seemed to put weights of lead on their legs and
 pour fire in their lungs with every breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It seemed as if they wouldn't make it and they would actually stop shy of
 the summit, forever perched on a jet black step of the bullhorns.
 With grudging determination though and the constant urging of Amonas to
 ignore the pain that made even breathing quite a daunting task, they finally
 reached the last step, where the summit lay all around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Panting from the exertion and the toll on their lungs they sprawled themselves
 on the surface of the summit, which was similar but not entirely so to
 the blocks of black material they had been climbing on for what must have
 genuinely been hours on end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
For a few minutes they lay there, doing nothing but squinting at the ever-presen
t sun and breathing deeply, trying to get their lungs to work normally again.
 They felt almost unable to move their legs and their whole upper torso
 felt stiff from the tension and the aggravated efforts to reach the top.
 They had succeeded, but that had left them drained and exhausted, and staggerin
gly so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas was the first of the two to stand up with a visibly strained effort.
 He tried to walk about the summit which was a large terrace from which
 the horns themselves sprouted from on either side, one of them casting
 a permanent shadow on the wide mat black surface, while the other one did
 so on one of the sides.
 He grabbed Hilderich by one shoulder as he was still laying down seemingly
 ready to fall asleep, and roused him to action once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, Hilderich.
 A last bit of effort.
 Let's stand at the shadow over there.
 It's a bit of a walk but I promise, you can sleep later on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich moaned audibly, expressing both the fatigue that had overtaken
 him as well as his reluctance to even lift his head in protest, much less
 walk someplace in the state he was in.
 But to Amonas' surprise which was evident in the furrow of his brow, Hilderich
 managed to pull himself together and stand up, though he had pain written
 all over his face and creaking and crackling noises came from his joints,
 bones, and muscles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They reached the base of the shadowed horn, where Hilderich let his body
 go almost limp and fall on the surface.
 Amonas sat himself down with less violence and noticed that Hilderich had
 not hurt himself in any way by the fall, or did not seem to feel any pain.
 At least not greater pain than the one he already was in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas then spoke with a weary, yet friendly voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Finally, we've reached the summit.
 And there's some shadow to rest under.
 I'd try and look around for what we can find, but we're both exhausted.
 I think we should rest a while first.
 The place won't go away under our feet right away now, will it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas grin as well as anything he else he might have said at that point
 was useless.
 Shortly after he finished his sentence, he heard Hilderich snore in his
 usually loud and unworried way.
 Amonas felt like sleeping as well.
 His body craved it, and his mind told him he could more than use some sleep
 right at that moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Before he laid himself on the hard surface of the summit, he covered Hilderich
 with his cloak.
 He turned to face the other bullhorn, closed his eyes and before soon he
 had fallen soundly asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The first one to notice the vibrations was Hilderich.
 He woke up suddenly, as if emerging from a fitful sleep, having seen a
 nightmare instead of a dream.
 He could feel a throbbing sensation coursing through his body, not very
 much unlike a headache.
 It was a deeply mechanical aesthesis, as if the very air could vibrate
 almost visibly.
 As he stood upright with his senses on the edge waiting for the next sign
 of impending disaster, he could feel his teeth clatter upon each other
 involuntarily.
 He woke up Amonas immediately by rather indelicately kicking him in the
 ribs softly.
 Amonas was sluggish coming around when the whole surface underneath them
 lit up like a miniature sun lay within it, a bright white light underpinning
 their figures.
 The throbbing became a more audible trembling, a deep rumbling feeling
 that seemed to come from way underneath them.
 His surprise alerted his reflexes and with a sudden and deft move he was
 on his feet, his head turning in all directions, trying to establish some
 sort of enemy direction to no avail.
 Hilderich spoke hurriedly to Amonas, unrestrained anxiety in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas was still a bit drowsy from his sleep and slow to react, but he eventuall

 Visibly a little flabbergasted from what was going on around him, he asked
 Hilderich:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich left Amonas standing there, trying to picture in his head what
 he would be exactly looking for and walked away towards the center of the
 surface while at the same time the rumbling grew louder and the light stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich though in a frantic state and not in complete control of his thoughts
 and actions, certainly far from being cool-headed and analytical in such
 moments, still had a knack of noticing things that stood out.
 The blemishes, the one piece that didn't quite fit, the bits that were
 important.
 After a quick look at the bullhorns themselves, his mind was now working
 in a sort of slowed down time, where every scene in front of his eyes could
 be postponed almost infinitely, brought to a crawling stop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There, in a bubble of still time, in a heightened state of mind he would
 find what seemed important, come up with theories about its existence and
 role, its properties and characteristics, and then start eliminating what
 didn't fit or was not as probable; in the end he'd come up with a solution
 to a problem, or a keen insight that would prove to be correct and to the
 point.
 It was a rare ability he had seldom noticed himself, and rarely gave it
 much heed as he seemed to not be able to use it constantly.
 It simply happened at certain times, as if something like fear or great
 necessity triggered it despite Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was then that he had caught something with the corner of his eye, and
 had pretty much arrived to a conclusion about its significance before he
 could turn around and yell to Amonas:

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas' reflexes were much better than Hilderich's and he had the clarity
 of mind not to question people when they instructed him to take cover,
 since they usually did so with the intended purpose of saving your skin.
 His body moved almost of its own volition and he let himself fly towards
 the hard surface of the bullhorns' summit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he did so, his eyes caught a glimpse of what must have been nothing less
 than fiery death.
 Amonas was barely able to see a giant ball of fire hurtling itself with
 blinding speed towards them, towards this particular bullhorn.
 There was a silvery quality about the fire and as it came over through
 the bullhorns beyond, he could barely make out Hilderich trying to throw
 himself flat against the bullhorn closest to him in a fashion that would
 seem rather comical in any other situation.
 The flaming apparition was just passing the last bullhorn before Amonas
 instinctively closed his eyes as if that would make it go away, and that
 was the last thing he saw for what appeared to be eternity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He only opened his eyes after the terrible sound of the sky tearing itself
 apart with the force of a thousand thunders or more had passed, when he
 could breathe once more; when the scorching heat wave above him had come
 and gone again in the blink of an eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He thought he had gone deaf but he could hear himself getting up; the sense
 of sound slowly returned though his ears ringed like his head had been
 turned into a living bell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He checked around to see Hilderich and found him lying on the black surface,
 trying to move or perhaps stand up.
 He seemed quite visibly as shaken as he was himself.
 But Amonas knew he was alive.
 Whatever that thing was, they were both alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It had come and gone like a God of thunder, Amonas thought.
 It was strange that he would think in such terms but he had no alternative
 to express himself by.
 Whatever that thing was it felt indeed as they had been nearly smitten
 by a fiery God of thunder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He offered his hand to Hilderich to help him up to his feet.
 Hilderich took it without second thought, dazed and flabbergasted though
 he was.
 As he did so, his gaze was fixed towards the direction of the fireball
 that had nearly killed them.
 Hilderich just stood there transfixed, looking out as if waiting for that
 thing to come around and finish them, as if they had been marked for death
 and their end was inevitably near.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas looked worried and held Hilderich's arms trying to attract his attention,
 calling out his name, asking him what was the matter.
 But Hilderich could only afford a mere flick of his gaze, the rest of him
 steadily fixed on the far side of the horizon across the row of bullhorns
 from where the flaming thunder had passed over.
 Hilderich then spoke mesmerized, with grave seriousness in his every word:

 corridors of the Disciplinarium were enigmatically silent.
 Lord Ursempyre Remis was being escorted by a pair of procrastinators at
 the behest of the Patriarch himself, he had been told.
 The mere thought of that man made him uneasy, and now he had been summoned
 personally.
 His mind raced with conjecture and the possible reasons: none seemed even
 remotely harmless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As his steps echoed in the stone floor of the hallways that never seemed
 to end, he thought he had a pretty good idea of the Patriarch's intentions.
 He thought that perhaps the Patriarch knew something, but he had to learn
 that for himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
See it in my eyes, Ursempyre thought.
 He would maintain the facade of the ignorant noble to whatever end might
 await him.
 This was a critical point.
 Everything hung in a precarious balance, and this was the push that could
 tip things over either way.
 He calmed himself, emptied his mind and held to just one conviction: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
`I am Lord Ursempyre Remis, Noble Representative, Duke of the Fief of Wir
 and Prefect of Urfall.
 I serve the Law and the Pantheon, I abide to the rulings of the Council'.
 That would be the only thought coursing in his mind, and he would make-believe
 if he had to.
 And if things came to that, he had prepared for other contingencies: his
 people had been given instructions.
 He merely hoped there was time enough, that things would not be rushed
 before time was due.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They passed through many hallways, some of them exquisitely decorated with
 hand-woven tapestries of a beautiful, delicate, and quite extravagant nature.
 Others were bleak, strictly functional and indifferent to the eye, not
 destined to impress or provoke awe.
 Probably hardly ever seen or used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There was a nagging feeling that he was being treated as if he had not been
 summoned here officially.
 Indeed, the procrastinators had seemed eager enough to take him by force
 had he resisted.
 Would the Patriarch be so rash? Would he suddenly arrest him without good
 reason? Certainly he had the power to do so, but was it to his best interest?
 How could he ever succeed in finding out what drove the Patriarch? Nothing
 useful was to be found in Ursempyre's bag of thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The man was a terrifying mystery, an uncanny wildfire people tried to steer
 away from.
 The kind of fire that only consumed and never warmed or lit.
 He was probably the most dangerous man Ursempyre could indeed face; even
 more dangerous than the Castigator, who was a tyrant and a heartless man,
 a man that cared for naught but power and its exertion over men.
 But the Castigator was still a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His motives could be understood, some of his actions anticipated.
 Perhaps he could be reasoned to the extent that it would seem to him to
 be in his best interests, offering him a deal he could not refuse.
 But the Patriarch was a blank, as if he were totally heedless of the circumstan
ces, the dynamics of power play, and indeed the workings of the world around
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It felt like he had an agenda no one could hope to fathom, plans within
 plans that he had no intention of altering or suspending.
 He was relentless in whatever pursuit he was involved in, and once one
 laid his eyes on him, he looked back uncannily.
 It was an eerie feeling, him knowing you were watching.
 It made one think that this man could read your mind with a glance, know
 your fears, your weaknesses; the things that made you cry and the things
 that made you laugh.
 It was as if the Patriarch were a chilling, unnatural force that could
 bore right into your soul and leave you empty; a walking husk with your
 mind and soul gone forever, his own for the taking at nothing but a whim
 of his.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ursempyre shuddered at these thoughts visibly.
 One of the procrastinators noticed and sniggered scornfully.
 Ursempyre turned to look at what could easily be a common thug in the streets
 of Pyr, and stared at him intently with a hint of suppressed wrath in his
 gaze.
 The procrastinator lost his grin almost instantly and stared away, averting
 his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Night had only just fallen outside and servants could be seen running about
 the Disciplinarium, lighting up braziers and chandeliers wherever appropriate.
 Halls, corridors, and chambers were being lit up one by one, staff and
 officials grinding on at the work that needed to be done during these times
 of war preparations; work that would probably keep them up all night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They went past the administrative areas, through small warehouses and store
 rooms.
 Lighting was at a premium in these parts of the Disciplinarium with only
 a few torches spread thin, darkness and light exchanging places with one
 another at uneven intervals.
 One of the procrastinators paused and unhitched a torch from its post to
 carry along with him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were descending deep down in the lower levels of the Disciplinarium,
 places that Ursempyre had always been loathe to visit for he was aware
 of the acts usually being performed in those chambers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Kept hidden from prying eyes, this was the place where the enemies of the
 state, the sinners and the ones who were considered dangerous, unruly,
 and frivolous with the La were brought to be chastised and enlightened.
 His face grimaced at the thought of the euphemism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Chastisement and enlightenment came at the price of torn fingernails, pried
 tongues, flogged backs, and broken bones.
 And then there were those who were made to utterly disappear; the dungeons
 of the Disciplinarium their last murky, cold abode.
 He knew now what was coming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would be thoroughly interrogated by the Patriarch himself.
 The die was cast, it seemed.
 There was nothing more he could do.
 He hoped he would be able to escape with his life, but if it came to that,
 he had made arrangements.
 Everything would be put in motion if the hours passed without him emerging.
 It was all planned and primed, ready for what was in the end only inevitable
 and long ago decided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The uprising would begin.
 He would try and beguile the Patriarch, a task that genuinely seemed desperate,
 but he would.
 If and when he failed at that, he would endure as long as he could, until
 his body failed him; until his mind and soul were utterly crushed.
 He had no misgivings, no fantasies of standing up against the Patriarch
 for too long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He knew not what tools of torture the Patriarch used, but he knew that none
 of those that were made the focus of his unbridled attention had been left
 unbroken.
 Those that he touched, they all gave up in the end.
 They all talked, they all begged for their lives like lesser men, like
 cornered animals, their instincts having them make a last attempt at salvation.
 But there was no mercy to be had, no humanity in his work.
 If he could not outsmart him or outplay him in a game of his own devising,
 then his life was forfeit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps later rather than sooner, but he would be done for in the end.
 All that mattered was that the uprising had to succeed, that it should
 indeed take them by surprise somehow.
 Even if he knew, stalling him might make the difference.
 Even if the Patriarch knew, that did not necessarily mean all hope was
 lost.
 They would fight as the should.
 If he himself perished during the hours that would follow, it mattered
 not.
 His memory would live on, his legacy and story told as part of the Liberation
 of the Territories.
 That would be good enough an ending for House Remis, and good enough for
 him as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They would be free, again.
 Free to live their own lives as they saw fit.
 Damn the Patriarch and the Castigator and all their cronies, henchmen,
 thugs, and devils; damn those men that willingly gave up their souls in
 exchange for a whip, a quill, or a sword.
 Damn them all, they would be free and let those tyrants think otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Having lost himself in thought, he hadn't been aware they had descended
 unusually deep.
 Instead of stone masonry and man-made walls, they were now walking amidst
 tunnels wide enough for two men to walk side by side, dug in the rock and
 granite of the Disciplinarium hill.
 These were old, older than the Disciplinarium, carved in a time lost from
 memory that no annal had recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Though he was privy to most of the workings of the Disciplinarium, he had
 not known the dungeons extended to such a depth.
 He was surprised.
 He felt wary of the other surprises that lay in stock for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Soon they reached a grated gate, sentry guards posted in both sides of the
 gate.
 Where the far side lay, there was little or no light from torches or any
 other kind of lighting.
 No candles either.
 Simply darkness, eerie and silent, like ink was blotting out his sense
 of sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One of the procrastinators nodded to the sentries to leave their posts.
 They would be taking over.
 The sentries looked at each other knowingly and without protest, question
 or remark; one of them opened the gate, handed their heavy cast iron keys
 to the procrastinators and quietly and without further ado left in an organized
 fashion forming a single file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One of them looked back and cast a passing gaze at Ursempyre and an expression
 of surprised recognition formed in his face and then it was gone; it was
 replaced by a fearful crease of terrible knowledge on his forehead.
 Ursempyre thought with bitterness that even the guards around this place
 realized the importance of what would follow.
 The Noble Representative would be tortured, questioned, and killed by the
 Patriarch himself.
 An ill omen, but who would challenge the will of the Law and the Patriarch,
 Reverent and Beloved of the Gods, the Holy Avatar? Not a lowly guard, that
 much was certain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
One of the men that had led him into the caves spoke with a restrained voice,
 somewhat confused about whether he should refer to Ursempyre as a Lord
 or as just another lost soul at the non-existing mercy of the Patriarch.
 He chose the latter, fearful of the walls having ears:

-Amonas has been brainwashed by the Patriarch.
 When Amonas first stumbled upon the teleporter, he was in fact teleported

 When he was brainwashed he was led to believe he saw the truth behind the
 Council, the Castigator and the Patriarch and he was implanted with the
 mission of seeking out Hilderich and bringing to the teleporter in order
 to get to the bullhorns.
 The bullhorns and the mass driver train are the only way into the Necropolis.
 In essence, the PAtriarch needs Hilderich's Master Keystone in order to
 open the Necropolis.
 He has to get someone into the NEcropolis and his best bet is his Pawn

 Once they open the Necropolis, he will be able to march into the Widelands

-The Patriarch has been creating more and more oppresive ways to create
 a rebellion in order to draw out what he believes must be the last remnants
 of his enemy.
 He has done so before, each rebellion failing, and the game still hasn't
 ended.
 He is fed up and wants to cheat indirectly.
 That is why he uses Amonas, who was a member of the resitence who stumbled
 upon the teleporter in the first place.
 The Patriarch as the player's avatar has knowledge of the teleporters and
 the mass driver train and such, but he cannot actively use them as that
 would be in violation of the rules and he would be disqualified.
 The mass driver train is in fact a network of such trains that serves as
 the mechanism behind the support of the two shells, it is what makes the
 structure of the shellworld viable.
 The key is to gain indirect access to the game's center, the Stoneforger,

Ursempyre's interest was at once piqued by what he was seeing all around
 him: Four large glass columns like huge rods brimming with light, seemingly
 supporting the tall, wide rocky chamber.
 The Patriarch was standing with his back turned to Ursempyre right amid
 the four columns, his bald scalp glistening under the blueish-white light
 of the columns, gossamer shadows of himself cast in the shape of a cross
 across the rough and uneven, rocky floor.
 Small wet brown lime stone indentations and juts dotted the ground.
 A faint humming noise echoed faintly throughout the chamber, which was
 otherwise deafeningly silent.

Ursempyre was drawn into the scenery, taken by surprise but not overwhelmed.
 He felt curious.
 So much more as to what the intentions of the Patriarch were.

 Instead, he was being shown something very few people, if ever, became
 privy to.
 He thought then that perhaps the folk tales about the ancients and the
 curator's ramblings were not all for naught.
 But then again, what reason did the Patriarch have to reveal such a place
 to him?
\end_layout

His thoughts were interrupted by the sly, surreptitious voice of the Patriarch,

 Strangely enough, he didn't look resplendent or intimidating.

 quality cloth.
 It was as if he sounded sincere for the first time when he spoke again:

 He meant to come across as serious and truthful, yet not just another lackey

 Even though in his gut he knew that was nothing but a lie.

Ursempyre was still looking at the Patriarch dumbfounded, not as much because

 He was being flippant, mocking Ursempyre in the process.

Ursempyre knew now he had been exposed as the leader of the kinsfolk from
 the beginning, it was the niceties that had simply evaporated.
 He steeled himself mentally, closed his eyes and tried to think of happier,
 earlier times.
 His muscles relaxed.
 He was waiting for a hammering blow.
 Nothing happened any time soon.
 He opened his eyes to see the Patriarch draw his chair, and sag in it,

 He sighed, and then spoke in a raspy, tired voice, more suited to a broken

 weak mind break down from hopelessness and despair? Could you indeed ride

Ursempyre was even more mystified at what the Patriarch was saying.
 Again he noticed, it wasn't the trick show and the flashiness or the strangenes

 It was the Patriarch himself that was doing it; his words seemed to twist
 reality and violate normalcy.

\begin_layout Standard

He was acting out of character, for one thing.
 It was as if he was trying to make some point, but was having real difficulty

 He was somehow circumnavigating the point in question, never directly touching
 it, uttering generalities and giving cryptic hints, as if his annotations
 alone sufficed to make himself understood.

Ursempyre hated that quality in a person: evasiveness, mucking about rather

The Patriarch reached out for a small goblet of wine, its contents sloshing
 as if it had just been poured.
 In fact, it had just appeared on his desk.
 He sipped some wine while Lord Remis tried to calm himself down; his laughter
 was stilled by the Patriarch's lack of an answer, physical or verbal.
 After seeming to savor the wine properly at length like a man who found
 meaning in the tasteful little joys of life would, he said with more authority,
 gravity weighing his words down heavily, the rocky chamber echoing them

The Patriarch had risen from his seat with hands behind his back, and was

 if it had the ability to reveal what lay behind the facade of the Patriarch.
 Ursempyre felt suddenly naked, as if he had been bared against his will,
 but he did not protest.
 He felt ashamed, for not erupting in anger.
 What really must have bothered him though was finding out that, in the
 end, he seemed completely transparent.

 I'll indulge your inquisitiveness, for the sake of argument.
 Perhaps, you'll rarely hear me admit it, I do love to revel in my superiority.

 holding a finger to his lips as if he were searching for his next words,
 engrossed in thought.
 Ursempyre was transfixed, staring at him with his mind locked in the astounding
 proposition he had made.
 He thought he shouldn't be doing this, he shouldn't be even listening to
 this devil.
 His heart told him to try and rip this human-shaped terror apart, for everyone'

 His mind though told him to stay his wrath, and listen.
 He was being told things he would never have known otherwise.
 Things he might be able to use if he came out of this alive, if indeed
 they were as they felt to be, the truthful ramblings of the malefic despot.
 The Patriarch resumed what was beginning to look like a monologue, or rather
 his explanation of things:

 All this time Ursempyre had not moved from the place where he had been

Ursempyre tried to take in the Patriarch's words, but he felt unable to.
 It was an overwhelming thought.
 There were so many questions and possibilities going through his mind.
 Would he actually consider such a proposal? Did it have any merit? Would
 the Patriarch keep true to his word? What chance would he stand against
 the Patriarch once he felt like he had served his purpose? If he was so
 powerful, why did he need him? Why shouldn't he crush the rebellion altogether?
 Why did he need him? What were the limitations of his strange powers, and
 where did those powers stem from? Demons?

Like the Gods, he believed that no such things existed either but their
 evil foul stench was real.
 Should he accept the vacant role it would probably be a bloodless uprising,
 but to what a future would it lead? This rotten system would not go away.
 The Patriarch, and the Council, and all their tyranny would still be around
 and he would be part of it, unable to do anything to change all that.
 He felt dirty, almost soiled that he had even began to consider such an
 offer, that he actually tried to put it on a scale and weigh their future

 He had decided.
 He would not become a willing pawn.

I think you've misunderstood my intentions.

 Perhaps I haven't been too clear, and at the same time I have misjudged
 your intelligence and powers of reasoning and extrapolation.
 I am not sharing power, or recognizing my decisions and rule as mistaken.
 You will not be handed any real measure of authority and yes, the people

 You have no real lever against me, apart from certain time constraints
 that I must keep in mind.
 In other words, I am offering you a much more civilized way out, because
 I haven't got the time to grind your puny rebellious followers into oblivion.
 Is that much understood now? Am I coming across? Can you reestablish the
 true position you are in now? Can you fathom that in my greater scheme
 of things you and your 'people' are a nuisance I want to deal with efficiently

 How could you possible know the truth of the cosmos? You still think of

 You would know real fear and awe when you saw the death of a star, I can

 The Castigator was another pawn.
 These weird abilities of the Patriarch.

 Folk tales they had seemed, but now they were inescapably real, made manifest

 He did not know their true nature, and was loathe to find out.
 Still, why was he being offered this now? Should he not refuse? What made
 the Patriarch so certain of his superiority? What was the true extent of
 his power? Why had he not crushed them at their inception while they were
 still a handful; weak, their organization still a dream, a footnote of
 history and legend brought back from oblivion, nothing but a speck against
 the power the Council held over all? He had to find out before he plunged

 Even the earth and the water, so indispensable to life itself, has become
 a commodity, something to be sold and acquired, according to your sick
 whims and desires.
 Even though that has held true for generations, we are willing to give
 our lives to stop this.
 Believe me, we will; unquestioningly, unflinchingly.
 How will you break that resolve, I ask you? Since you are the one that

 What good will the vanishing tricks do? Will you just vanish when the crowds
 of free men will be running after you, demanding nothing less than your
 head? Or will you put on another light show like the one around me, hoping

 I must admit I sometimes feel a certain measure of pride at what I have
 achieved here.
 As for your other question, I believe that you should be careful not to
 confuse what you have seen here with the true extend of my powers.
 This is not a show I put on for you specifically, Lord Remis.
 It is merely an extension of courtesy, in good faith.
 I simply meant to cast off my regular mask, to create an honest, conversational

 I simply showed you that I am not the man you might have thought I was

 Tell me, Ursempyre, have you heard of Shan the Traitor? The terrible Betrayer?

Ursempyre did not expect such a reference at such a time.
 The last thing he expected right at that time was a lesson in history and
 tales.
 But he indulged the Patriarch, who seemed to be trying to veer him off
 course nevertheless:

I have.
 It is supposed to be a part of history that has been wiped clean.
 I believe it is a myth, an insidious lie spread purposefully to dishearten
 and discourage any who would even think about opposing you; a story to
 suppress their anger with fear and awe, with a promise of terrible retribution
 and divine wrath.
 An angel of the Gods who would come down from above and wipe us all in
 one sweep, one fell blow? Is that what you would have me believe? That
 you have that kind of power? That you will pray to your Gods and they will
 crush us like ants? Is your purpose to turn me, Patriarch, or is it to
 make me laugh?

\begin_layout Standard

The Patriarch took a step back, and extended his arms.
 He took on a solemn expression, as if praying or concentrating deeply.
 A strange smell assaulted Ursempyre's nostrils.
 It seemed to emanate from the Patriarch as far as Ursempyre could tell.
 A smell that reminded him of metal against metal, the smell of a blacksmith's
 shop but all he could see was that the Patriarch was now a bit taller than
 before.
 `No,' he thought, `he is not taller'.
 `Something's wrong here,' his mind voiced with concern.
 He noticed the Patriarch's feet were no longer touching the ground.
 Faint bluish crackles of light like tiny lightnings and sparks of light
 coursed through the Patriarch, his bald scalp having taken on an eerie
 sheen as if it had suddenly transformed into a shiny metal mirror.
 The Patriarch grinned and uttered in High Helican:

Behold, the Holy Avatar.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With that, the Patriarch tensed and a bright shiny aura began to emanate
 from within him.
 His robes were drawn in, tightened around his body as if they had instantly
 shrunk.
 They visibly outlined his figure, and Ursempyre was surprised once more
 to see that such a body did not belong to an old man.
 It was immaculate, perfectly carved as if it were a statue; the penultimate
 monument to the human body, its musculature detailed beyond any artisan's
 capabilities and talent.
 It was the body of a demi-God, exuding awe by sight alone.
 The Patriarch's face began to twist and reshape itself as if it was made
 of water or mercury; all his facial characteristics were turning into a
 pool engulfed in bright light, as if fire was about to scorch it.
 And all the while Remis could see the grin of the Patriarch, even though
 his face was no longer there.
 His mind reeled from the sight before him.
 It was true then; this was a monster beyond comparison.
 The stories and legends were true.
 And the Day of Redemption had happened.
 And it was him who had made it happen.
 It was him all along.
 Even before, all those years past.
 It had always been him.
 The realization left him wide-eyed struggling for breath.
 The robes around the Patriarch were absorbed into his flesh, which was
 now a rippling pool of molten metal, incandescent with a fiery aura around
 it.
 He was levitating a few feet above the ground, resplendent and regal in
 his unique and terrible form.
 The figure spoke at him, with no visible source for its voice:

Ursempyre could not know whether he was hearing the voice through his ears

 him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ursempyre felt shocked, minuscule, and unimportant.
 They were up against a being of unimaginable power, not based solely on
 its manipulations, schemes, and outright terror practices.
 This was something else entirely; the Patriarch was the wielder of terrible
 force.
 A demon that left one mesmerized in awe.
 `Why couldn't this be a mere show?', he thought.
 How could he have lived so long ago? How could he have brought such destruction
 by himself alone? How did he know he wasn't just lying, as was his usual
 practice? Such thoughts pained him with their inability to be answered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He knew.
 When he saw him change into that thing, he saw.
 He felt its corruption overwhelm him and its malevolence flow around him,
 its power beaming right through him.
 It was true.
 He didn't know how exactly it was possible, but it was true.
 He could wipe them out if he needed too, if he wanted to.
 He did not believe that thing could be hurt, not in any real sense.
 He did not know whether the Patriarch himself was still vulnerable, but
 he now believed this was his true form, and the old man a mere charade
 he found more practical.
 Perhaps it was another one of his whims.
 It didn't matter, this was inescapable.
 He had no options now.
 All he had been planning was for naught.
 He would play along.
 But he would not give up.
 No, he knew they were at a disadvantage, but that was now a blessing.
 Had they went on with their plan, they would have been culled like sheep.
 It was almost as if he was trying to give them a warning, a second chance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ursempyre decided he would capitulate; he would accept, but only for a while.
 Only until he knew what was going on this world of his and what was the
 truth behind all this.
 Until he found out who was this being that had ruled over them for untold
 years with iron and steel, whip and truncheon.
 He'd do what he could, and perhaps find a way to bring him down.
 The others, though, who had not seen what he had seen, would they believe
 him? Or would they just curse him as the traitor he would seem to have
 become? He could do little about that.
 He only hoped they'd forgive him before his end.
 That somehow this would work out.
 He turned to face the fiery figure, and looking at where its eyes should
 have been, managed to utter levelly:

 your men to stand down and reconcile their grievances, as reforms are sure
 to be made and an arrangement has been agreed upon for a gradual transition
 into a free society.
 I believe the majority will accept such a turn of events with relief.
 No one likes dying.
 Except for a few fools that will probably follow your plan to the end anyway.
 Nothing important that my people will not be able to handle.

The Patriarch returned to his human form in mere moments, the transition
 this time a lot quicker and much less dramatic.
 He offered his hand grinning profusely, but Ursempyre did not accept it.
 He rather looked at the Patriarch's hand with boiling contempt and disgust.
 The Patriarch insisted, the hand still extended for a handshake, and said:

Ursempyre's face was tense, as if carved of stone.
 His equally hard glare at the Patriarch with eyes like fiery pinpricks
 of unyielding light, indicated that he was expending huge amounts of patience
 and self-restrain in order for him not to lunge at the Patriarch right
 then and there.
 But he would bide his time.
 With obvious reluctance and slow, deliberate motions that brought to mind
 a man in pain, he managed to shake hands with the Patriarch.
 He felt like he now carried a stain he could never wash off.
 He paused in thought and asked the Patriarch who was about to call out
 to the guards:

 tall bleak man in a uniform approached a couple of soldiers that were standing
 over a fire.
 A kettle on top was brewing something with an uncharacteristic, though
 quite off-putting smell.
 They were sitting on some sacks laden with what must have been rice or
 wheat and having a smoke, sharing a pipe of what one knowledgeable in the
 art of uwe smoking could make out to be stale uwe.
 They were unaware of the tall man coming their way with their backs turned
 to him.
 They were admiring the ships loading and unloading their cargoes in the
 distance of the harbor, with the suns setting down one after the other,
 painting the sea mauve and bloody red, the sails casting their last shadows
 for the day.
 Their calm reverie was broken by a harsh, raspy voice:

What's in that kettle? Smells worse than the cow dung you're smoking.

One of the two soldiers turned around and with a fleeting look of small
 surprise offered the pipe to the tall man, in spite of him sounding provocative
ly belittling.
 The other soldier remained indifferent; his head seemed to follow a flock
 of seabirds in the distance, swooping over the sea probably hunting fish,
 or perhaps idling away their time just as they were.
 The tall man was now standing with one foot on a stack of sacks.
 He took the proffered pipe and drew a quaff of smoke savoring it before
 exhaling slowly, and then spoke to the two soldiers:

Dekar Pirru shook his head, grinning at the same time.
 Mott was now stirring his broth with a thick wooden stick that just seemed
 to have been lying around handily.
 Lanris was putting some fresh uwe in his pipe.
 Dusk was upon them, the smoke from their kettle barely visible.
 Dekar Pirru seemed suddenly engrossed with thought with his gaze stuck
 on the boiling kettle and his eyes seemingly out of focus.
 Lanris took notice, waved his hand to check if indeed the dekar was in
 touch with his surroundings and found out that was not the case.
 He said with some lack of conviction:

The dekar was standing upright again with arms folded, the sheath of his

 Lanris on the other hand seemed quite relaxed, resting on the sacks nonchalantl

 He took a drought of smoke from his pipe, before answering his dekar without
 turning to look at him:

Lanris intoned the somewhat haughty word with a certain character and an
 outlandish accent that made everyone laugh, especially Mott whose sullen
 mood was eased and was now up on his feet again, stirring his stew with
 a certain air of culinary dexterity.
 Around them more campfires could be seen, soldiers like them who were about
 to cook something of their own, usually broths of wheat or barley which
 were the main staple food the army provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

They were about to relax from the exercises of the day, as well as their
 other various duties.
 Some would eat something quick before heading off for sentry and patrol
 duty and some very lucky few would rest their aching muscles, have a pipe

 the next morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Some would have made their own arrangements concerning food, perhaps going
 out of their way to procure some meat either by hunting or by making certain
 trades, sometimes of a dubious nature.
 Most of the soldiers that did so, traded wine for meat or eggs.
 Wine and spirits were strongly forbidden but vinegar was allowed to be
 carried, as it was a proven and allowed way of cleaning up wounds as well
 as widely used in the soldier's personal hygiene.
 At least for those that had one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Some had a knack of mixing some vinegar with wine right before consuming
 it, in case some of the officers or procrastinators were making their rounds
 checking up on morale, or discipline in the latter case.
 It marred the quality and taste of the wine, but that was usually low to
 begin with anyway.
 Some had dubbed it winegar, and the name was in wide use throughout the
 army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even the officers partook sometimes, as it was known to them that the morale
 and cohesion of an army was far more important in battle than mere discipline
 and adherence to Law.
 It might be a sin, they knew, but who went through life as immaculate and
 free of sin as in their day of birth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And as long as those buffoons, the procrastinators, were none the wiser,
 everything worked almost as it should; the army served its Castigator and
 the Pantheon in a most untroubled fashion.
 After all as some of the older officers used to say, `you can't make soldiers
 out of men if you don't break open a few casks first.'

Mott simply shrugged and went to his backpack to fetch his canteen.

They each helped themselves to a serving and sat down on the ground with
 their backs against the sacks.
 They split some leftover bread-pie from their midday meal, and each began
 eating from their canteens.
 Mott was clearly more than pleased with the quality of his cooking, gulping
 spoonfuls away with vivid enjoyment.
 Lanris seemed much more reserved in his appreciation, and looked simply
 thankful for having something other than the drab, gray gunk the army called
 food to fill his stomach with.

 Like the last time when he asked ten coin for some real Iolathan wine that
 turned out to be vinegar.
 Not even winegar, mind you.
 Plain old vinegar from the pharmacium stores.
 He even had the nerve to insist that it was a vintage bottle that had could
 be easily mistaken for vinegar by someone who wasn't a connoisseur.
 I think he meant you, dekar.

 He wasn't selling cow dung this time.
 I asked the Centarch somewhat sideways if all was going as planned, and
 he too said there was some upheaval upstairs.
 Some stuff would be put on hold until further notice.
 That's probably the reason I'm not putting the pair of you on auxiliary

Dekar Pirru and Private Lanris of the 5th, under the command of Cilliarch
 Romentho Isoract were put to the sword today at dawn immediately before
 roll call, by a squad of procrastinators.
 Expeditious procedures were followed and their files of death were officially
 sealed by both the Procrastinator's Office and the Strategium Proper.
 Private Mott of the 5th, was given fifty lashes and almost bled to death
 for, and I quote: 'Not being vigilant enough in the persecution of vile
 deeds that promoted sin, incurred the wrath of the Gods or were an affront
 to the Pantheon and the Ruling Council'.
 He was not allowed to return to his duties as an active soldier and as
 such was denied of medical attention.
 He was rotated to the work gangs as per the Cilliarch's orders.
 Also, Cilliarch Isoract relieved centarch Littmo from his duties and has
 petitioned that he be discharged dishonorably.
 The winegar in question seems to have been stolen from the centarch's personal
 cabinet, from what the procrastinators' investigation revealed.

General Tyrpledge saluted briefly, barely touching his breastplate with
 his relaxed fist and sighed.
 Major Guighan clicked his heels and resumed a more relaxed, but still attentive

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Tyrpledge seemed to ponder that suggestion for a little while, briefly consideri
ng what he should have the Major do.
 He was rather disenchanted by everything today.
 He was looking at the ceiling in a noncommital manner, the expression on
 his face lacking its usually austere, professional look.
 He had taken a look in his mirror earlier.
 He supposed he looked kind of glum and morose, perhaps even outright sad.
 There wasn't much he could do about it, he thought.
 Neither was there something for the Major to do as well.
 He waved him away with one hand, while he kept tapping a marching tune
 on his desk with the fingers of his other hand.

The Major was about to laugh, when he saw the General was not smiling when
 he said what the Major had thought of as funny.
 He then clicked his heels and made a couple of paces backwards still facing
 the General.
 He then turned about smartly and left, careful to close the door behind
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Tyrpledge sighed more audibly this time, thinking this day had started off
 more badly than usual.
 Though the term `usual' was rapidly evolving from day to day, this day
 seemed as bad as bad days can get.
 And it was still early morning.
 Major Guighan had just given him the latest situational report.
 These two men were the first dead in this campaign, and not a single enemy
 had been met yet.
 They'd been executed for drinking winegar and stealing from an officer.
 The centarch's career was gone.
 Perhaps at an opportune time, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Last night a message had arrived, complete with high-ranking ministers and
 a squad of the procrastinator elite.
 Tyrpledge had been notified that the army was now officially mobilized
 and legally at war.
 Of course, he thought, there were no specific orders included, other than
 that he should await for further notification at a later time.
 In essence, they were leaving him and his men to roast on red hot coals
 until it suited their purpose.
 Such was the fate of soldiers, he mused bitterly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Those orders had cost those men from the 5th their lives.
 As it is, they were at war even though they didn't know with who and that
 meant that by Law, the procrastinators dispersed among them had more authority
 than he did in matters of discipline, the prosecution of sinners and the
 relevant penalties that might apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It seemed that in wartime, theft and consumption of spirits and other substances
 that `occluded the mind' were punishable by death.
 Tyrpledge was thinking that the centarch whose life was destroyed was lucky
 compared to his men.
 He then spared a few moments thinking about the soldier who was found asleep,
 next to the ones that had been drinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had given him fifty lashes because he wasn't vigilant enough.
 And then they had left him to bleed to death.
 Tyrpledge's thoughts on the matter was that it would be a miracle if he
 made it out alive.
 But that's what war was about: bloodletting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Logic is thrown out the window,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he voiced his final thoughts in hushed tones, almost a whisper.
 He sat upright in his chair with his hands outstretched, his gaze focused
 outside beyond his window where he could see the majority of his battalions
 forming up.
 He could discern a sullen mood.
 It was not that the pace of the men milling about was slow.
 They were preparing their equipment fastidiously, checking their armor
 and their packs so as to make sure everything was in order.
 They had that unmistakable air of professionalism about them.
 But they seemed to be lacking the blaze in their eyes.
 The glimmer, the red flush cheeks that let you know their blood was boiling
 and their hearts pumping it with excitement.
 There were no such signs here.
 No nervous humor from his staff members, no raunchy jokes from the enlisted
 men.
 At least he couldn't see any of them laughing.
 Every face he could make out from that distance was stern and frigid.
 These, he thought, should not be the faces of men going to war knowing
 they might be dead before the night falls, wishing their death would be
 worthwhile and remembered, perhaps even praised.
 These were the faces of men thinking they might be dead before the day
 was through, wishing they were someplace else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The execution of the men from the 5th had taken quite a toll on overall
 morale.
 They might be much more cowed now, but that's not what he needed to wage
 war.
 He needed hot-bloodied men with vices and things to wish for.
 Not meek little children fearful of the reprisals of the Law.
 Why couldn't the procrastinators understand that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
For the briefest moment he thought about contacting the Procrastinator Militant
 asking for his assistance, perhaps telling him even to go as far as relaxing
 their vigilance in an effort to bend but not strictly break the Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He immediately thought better of it since he reminded himself that Gomermont
 was above all, first and foremost, an idiot.
 Telling an idiot who had spent a considerable amount of time and effort
 to become leader of a pack of idiots to smarten up a bit suddenly was,
 if not a one-way ticket to the gallows, a certain way to scream in despair
 at the mind-numbing foolishness the Procrastinator Militant exuded with
 his every utterance.
 In essence, it would be a lost cause.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There was a time for war and a time for peace, security, stability, and
 lawfulness.
 War was lawlessness in itself, a grandiose lawless fair where people died
 horribly and for reasons beyond their understanding; a time when nothing
 mattered more than victory.
 When would they understand that? Not soon enough it seemed, probably never
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His bleak thoughts were accented by the lack of a good cup of uwe.
 He decided he wanted a nice distraction, something to take his mind of
 a situation he now felt powerless to amend.
 He would just have to swim through the wave of the coming difficulties
 as they arose stoically.
 To do that he had to have a good cup of uwe, fresh and steamy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He now felt determined to turn his thoughts around and wish for the best,
 keep his hopes up.
 The uwe would be critical in that respect.
 He went for his bell in order to let his aide-de-camp know he wanted some
 uwe urgently but before he could do that, as if by a miracle or a mind-reading
 ability that the Major had not exhibited so far, he saw Guighan enter through
 the door in a hurried fashion, stand to one side, salute briskly and click
 the heels of his boots tucking his sword away with his free hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Before Tyrpledge could utter a single word, the Castigator of the Outer
 Territories walked in the general's office resplendent in his war gear,
 a match for what he was wearing on the anniversary of the Pacification
 of Zaelin; the brightly polished metal casting intense reflections of the
 suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Major tried to announce the Castigator's arrival, but he was cut short
 by a wave of the Castigator's hand, barely having had time to utter the
 word 'behold'.
 The Castigator was dressed for war, that much was certain.
 With his lavishly plumed helmet held under one arm, he asked the general
 directly, who was still sitting down in his chair, too flabbergasted to
 adhere to protocol and pay proper respect:

 His delay could mean a lot of things, most of which I dare not think about.

Ikebod's tone belied his fear.
 He sounded calm and accommodating, professional as ever.
 As if the danger his master was probably facing was no more than a hindrance,
 an annoyance at best, and that he would soon be surely meeting them at

 Celia on the other hand sat upright with a jolt, her eyes went wide and

Dear lady Celia, I know all that, and still I would ask of you to have something

 For your child's sake.
 Do not think of me as a cynic, or a blandly acquiescent servant.
 I dearly love Master Ursempyre, for I almost raised him as my own ever
 since his parents passed away when he was still just a little boy.
 Right before he left the estate, he gave me specific orders in the event
 of his disappearance.
 I too believe in the kinsfolk and the purpose that drives them.
 I would be betraying my master if I wavered, if I gave up without a fight,
 if I thought him dead and gone so easily.
 But even without him, lady Celia, life must go on.
 We must try our hardest to have freedom for all, for once.
 If anything should happen to him, I will grieve like a father who's lost
 his only child.
 But I've learned there's a time for grieving and a time for hoping; a time
 for fighting.
 And so I shall hope and fight, until I have reason to do nothing else but
 grieve.
 Do you understand that, my lady? I hope you do.
 Please now, come and have something to eat; if not for your sake, for your
 child's.

Celia looked in the old servant's eyes with compassion and a sudden care

 She thought she understood.
 In a manner, that was how she felt for Amonas who though was nowhere to

 he was alive.
 Against reason, she knew he was alive somewhere.
 And she'd better give up her life before she gave up hope.
 Because, she thought, even if Amonas would never return, their child would
 be born.
 And she would have to do her best to deliver her child in a new, free world.

They went up the stairs where they were greeted by a large dining-hall,
 dark green and gray marble columns supporting the high ceiling.
 Exquisitely ornamented chandeliers adorned the roof and cast bright candlelight
 across every corner.
 The grand dinner table was made from a fine solid piece of wood that seemed
 old and venerable; judging by its healthy sheen it was also thoroughly
 maintained.
 It was probably hundred of years old and from its size, Celia thought it
 could seat upwards of three dozen people, perhaps even four.
 She noticed there were no plates of food or dishes of any kind set and
 she was slightly puzzled.
 They were probably to be seated somewhere else then, she thought.

Celia inquired no further and soon they entered the kitchen itself.
 Dimly lit by a few candles, it was full of utensils and large wooden surfaces
 for chopping meat and foodstuffs.
 Large empty bowls, cauldrons and kettles were gathered in one corner.
 Though quite large for a kitchen, Celia felt the place was cramped and
 imagined it would be close to asphyxiating when people were working here
 in full swing.
 Ikebod pulled a chair and gestured for her to sit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She thanked him with a smile, and sat down to a quite normal table that
 seemed to have seen its fair share of use.
 It was indeed laid out with a simple linen, the bowl of soup in the middle,
 as well as a glass and a wooden jug of wine side by side.
 Her plate was already filled with steaming soup, which gave off a light
 aroma.
 Indeed, the kitchen smelled of a lot of things, and the odors seemed to
 fight each other fervently with no clear winner.
 She realized the smells exacerbated her hunger and she started to sip her
 soup eagerly.
 Ikebod asked Celia:

Her thoughts were disturbed by what seemed to be sounds akin to yelling

 It was all too sudden.
 Ikebod was already leaving the kitchen.
 He turned to her as he stood at the open door:

Ikebod was at once gone from her sight.
 She returned her gaze to the table.
 The desserts were lying in her plate in front of her, half-eaten and unruly.
 She noticed she had not restrained herself from eating as she pleased,
 but she had rather enjoyed it.
 Which was only natural not to last forever, she thought.
 The dimly lit kitchen which had felt warm and full of wholesome smells,
 now seemed vacant, cold, and dark.
 She felt like leaving the room immediately and did so with some haste.
 She wanted to see and hear the news herself.
 Perhaps there was some news about Amonas; her heart skipped a beat at the
 thought, but she brought her mind to its senses.
 That would not cause such an uproar.

She went through the corridor into the dinning-hall.
 She could hear voices from below, and she raced to the stairs leading to
 the waiting-room with wary expectation wrinkling her face.
 When she reached the feet of the stairs below, she could see Ikebod hurriedly
 conversing with three men, two of them clad in metal armor, and one of
 them bearing a disheveled cloak with mud and perhaps blood on his face.
 The two men must have been guards and were being issued orders probably,
 nodding emphatically at something Ikebod was explaining.
 The other man was evidently fatigued, perhaps injured, and he seemed exhausted
 from running.
 He was breathing heavily, once every so often gulping down some water from
 a tall jug.

I believe I have gathered conclusive evidence as to the function of the

 In fact, it can be safely proven by virtue of experimentation that these
 are in fact devices of a highly evolved civilization from an ancient past
 that perished long ago, leaving in its wake nothing but seemingly nondescript
 memorabilia as the remains of a monumental metropolis located in the Widelands.

had been watching Hilderich for what seemed to be the better part of an
 hour now.
 He had shocked Amonas with what he believed they were looking at in the
 sky, but Amonas had seen it himself when he knew what to look for.
 They were indeed standing on another world, and not on their own.
 Because the suns were not simply wrong; there was only one sun.
 Hilderich had noticed the lack of a second ring around the sun, and the
 regularity of ths sun's shape and size, unlike their own two suns that
 seemed to come together and slightly draw themselves apart again every
 once in a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
That was something Hilderich had come up with while intently studying the
 surface they were standing on, as well as the bases of the horns themselves.
 Amonas now saw him as he kept clutching the keystone, scratching it with
 a finger at times.
 He seemed to be quite absorbed in thought.
 Amonas had felt he could not contribute at this time, and did not bother
 Hilderich with questions or other small talk.
 He saw no way out of their situation and certainly no way to `ride the
 flames' as Hilderich had put it with enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As Amonas replayed in his mind what Hilderich had tried to explain to him,
 the idea seemed extravagantly far-fetched; more like a Curator's wild fantasy
 than anything that seemed to hold any ties with the realm of reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich insisted that the keystone was what would enable them to realize
 `the plan'.
 The plan was to signal the flaming sphere, bullet, missile or `train',
 whatever one might call it, to stop and pick them up.
 Amonas thought that first and foremost, it was preposterous to consider
 that thing that rushed over their heads could be tamed, indeed made to
 stop.
 It sounded as if a man would command a falling star to cushion its fall,
 to peacefully glide to a stop so he could touch it.
 Accordingly, the idea that one could actually even board such a thing defied
 any kind of logic Amonas could summon.
 Hilderich was either totally insane or on the brink of an ingenious discovery
 that could dwarf everything Amonas had ever known, including the things
 that had been revealed to him when he had stepped into the damnable pillar
 of light in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He truly hoped the latter case would hold true.
 In the meantime, while Hilderich seemed to be muttering to himself, pacing
 about the flat, matte black floor of the summit, Amonas' thoughts turned
 to Celia.
 Had she given birth to their child? Were they safe? Had the uprising began?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was afraid he would not be able to keep his promises to Celia.
 It all rested with Hilderich.
 It was a liberating emotion, in a sense, to have someone else hold the
 keys to your future.
 Someone else to blame; someone else's success or failure was in essence,
 what would gain him a trip back home or a slow, harrowing death filled
 with guilt, remorse and memories that would haunt him for whatever life
 would remain in him.
 But was everything really hanging on Hilderich's efforts? Was there nothing
 he could do or think of? Had he given up on them already?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
This damnable place afforded him no real rest; it toyed with his fears,
 his doubts, and his ignorance.
 He threw a fist to the black floor which remained unyielding, unmarred
 and unbroken.
 The pain that swept up from his hand jogged him back into his more usual
 mindset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even if he didn't have the slightest idea about this place and the flaming
 sphere, Hilderich seemed to have at least some estimation; something to
 follow through, something that, however improbable, might work.
 If it failed they'd find something else, move on and think of a different
 idea.
 Perhaps study the bullhorns in depth, find out their purpose.
 The land could support them, so they would keep on trying to get home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They would endure.
 All they had to do was endure and there would be a way.
 `There must be a way,' his mind echoed with that thought.
 He'd do his best to help Hilderich, even if that meant he'd have to trust
 him with his life.
 They'd get back, that's all that really mattered.
 He would get back home to Celia, and their child.
 He promised to himself he'd get back even if he'd have to limp back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The clutches of reality were inescapable though and he snapped back to it
 when the sweat running down his forehead had turned into a small, steady
 trickle.
 The heat even under the shadows was uncomfortable.
 They did not have much in the way of water left, only a couple of the hard-skin
ned fruit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was wary of leaving Hilderich alone while he went back down to collect
 some more of the fruit, perhaps locate some source of running water as
 well.
 The fruit were watery enough, but their sweet taste would soon feel sickly
 if they kept consuming them all the time.
 He'd have to breach the subject sooner or later, but he decided to give
 Hilderich some more time with his musings first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They did not know when the next flaming sphere would appear and that only
 served to increase Amonas' uneasiness.
 He believed it would be much more accommodating if they went down to the
 base of the bullhorns where they could find shelter from the sun.
 He also thought that they could forage while going around the base of the
 bull-horned structure, which Hilderich was now calling a `horned pyramid'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas thought that his was a much more sound, safe, and logical plan.
 Hilderich had argued against it, saying that there should be enough time
 between passes for them to figure out how to use the flaming vehicle, and
 they should not wander away when they could be so close to escaping this
 place.
 Amonas had resisted the idea in more depth by pointing out that even if
 that were so, they had not heard or seen the passing of such a thing ever
 since they arrived here, which would imply that whatever that thing was,
 it did not make frequent overpasses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich counter-argued that, as was the case with wagons and carriages,
 arrivals and departures did not have to be evenly spaced and sometimes
 schedules changed without notice, because of necessity.
 Amonas had left it at that but they at least agreed to go down once their
 water supply had run out to rest and re-supply; at the same time they could
 search around the base of the horned pyramids for a possible way in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich seemed to be lost in an inner circle of conjectures and theories
 that did not seem to produce any tangible practical benefits.
 At times he would stop and ask if Amonas had noticed anything new about
 the structure, especially the floor and the horns; Amonas would quietly
 and calmly insist that if anything to that effect did happen, he would
 surely notify him immediately.
 Hilderich would then nod and go back to his series of calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had already paced around the edges of the floor and had even walked over
 the shadows of the horns, seemingly measuring their length for reasons
 Amonas could not even hope to infer.
 It seemed like charlatanism; a madman in the wilderness trying to make
 sense of something bewilderingly distant like the suns or the stars, the
 color of the sky, and so on.
 But he would have to be patient and see for himself where it would lead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They'd soon have to go down to the base of the pyramid for water mostly,
 Amonas thought, believing Hilderich should be feeling dry as sand, definitely
 having developed a sunburn by that time as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The keystone in Hilderich's hand felt more like a sigil or a charm to him,
 something he had to connect himself with.
 He kept touching it, running his fingers around it, but he had yet to use
 it as the device he had said he believed it to be.
 It was a greenish stone that gave off blue, near turquoise reflections.
 It seemed to have a certain depth, and a curious reflective quality about
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It could be a raw gem, or something similar.
 Perhaps a glass, Amonas couldn't have been sure of its nature, and he certainly
 knew he was no expert.
 It was just that it had a very strange appearance, one that could not be
 easily compared to the usual cuts of stone or gem.
 Amonas thought that if nothing else at all, the keystone was a very rare
 thing indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Rare enough for someone to keep collecting them, and rare enough to seal
 Olom's fate.
 He'd certainly miss him.
 Celia had never known, perhaps it was for the best.
 Now that he's really gone beyond..
 Amonas felt it was a bit unfair on her.
 He felt guilty for not telling her the truth about her father, but it was
 a promise he would never break, and so had not.
 Perhaps in time, he could find it in his heart to tell her.
 On second thought he felt he was obligated to do so, actually.
 Just as soon as they got back, at a time that seemed to him quite indeterminabl
e at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With his thoughts on the matter concluded, Amonas decided he had stayed
 quiet for long enough and asked Hilderich who was standing near one far
 end of the summit, peering downwards over the edge:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich did not turn around, did not even stir or notion somehow.
 It seemed he was rather absorbed in thought.
 Amonas disliked shouting in principle, so he sighed and walked over to
 Hilderich.
 He noticed the man was standing at the lip of the summit, a step before
 falling over to the steps below.
 His arms were in front of him with the keystone in one hand, fingers opening
 and closing in quick succession.
 It looked as if he was counting something.
 Amonas cleared his throat audibly, as a way to attract Hilderich's attention
 and perhaps guard him from a surprise that could set him off balance in
 a most precarious fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich paused in his counting momentarily and looked distracted for a
 moment, hastily checking his left and right with a small motion of his
 head; he then resumed counting, fingers on both hands moving like he was
 playing the harp.
 Amonas closed his eyes in a show of mild exasperation, and said in his
 usual husky voice:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich paused and turned about slowly with a frown of surprise on his
 face.
 As he did so, he instinctively made a backwards motion with his head, tipping
 his upper torso slightly aft.
 That was enough to jerk him off his feet, throwing him towards the slope
 of steps he was surveying.
 His one arm flailed wildly in a vain effort to steady himself while clutching
 the keystone hard and stretching out his free hand as a desperate last
 ditch attempt to reach Amonas who was no more than two steps away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas reacted instinctively with cat-like speed and lunged forward making
 a single step and bending his body slightly towards the ground in a kneeling
 motion that brought his center of mass lower; he stretched out both of
 his hands, one reaching for Hilderich's free arm and one for the shirt
 about his waist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A still moment passed when Hilderich seemed doomed to fall and tumble down
 like a rag doll to a most certain grievous injury or even death with Amonas
 failing to do anything other than watch, his grasp failing by a hair's
 breadth.
 His mind was faster than his body so the terrible thought had time enough
 to coalesce with feelings of guilt and failure, curses and a repetitive
 voice that seemed to echo from afar; it was a simple form of denial, yet
 so piercing that it lanced right through his head, even before he could
 think he had uttered it:

Amonas stood there kneeling, his body tense, almost rigid.
 He was transfixed, wide-eyed and out of breath, his last one cut suddenly
 short.
 He gasped for air, and only then did he realize he was holding onto Hilderich's
 shirt and palm.
 Not very tightly though, but he could feel some of Hilderich's body weight
 pulling at him.
 He came to his senses and pulled back, edging Hilderich closer.
 He grabbed tighter with one hand and pulled harder, bringing Hilderich
 right back on his feet, safely on the summit's surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich looked surprised, the frown on his face even narrower than before.
 He had certainly began to show signs of sunburn.
 `Perhaps he was stricken from the sun and the light, and got dizzy all
 of a sudden when I called out to him,' Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich was looking about the floor, his hands going through his pockets.
 Something seemed amiss to Amonas.
 Hilderich cried out suddenly:

Amonas was forcing Hilderich to look him in the eyes in order to convey
 to him a sense of safety, security and calm.
 It was as if Hilderich was going through the shock of battle.
 Was the keystone so vital to him? To their survival? Was the keystone that
 sensitive, prone to damage? Had their chance to return home tumbled down
 into oblivion by the slip of a foot? `Everything in its own time,' Amonas
 thought as he cast these worrisome thoughts aside if only for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich turned around to look at the steps below searching for the keystone,
 this time with a healthier distance from the summit's precipice.
 He put a hand up to offer his eyes some shade, but still he squinted as
 he tried to make out such a small thing from such a distance.
 He was obviously disgruntled with what had happened, and after searching
 in vain some more, he turned around to Amonas and told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas jogged briskly to pick up his sack that was lying under the shadow
 of a horn and as he came back to Hilderich, he produced one of their last
 two 'brown ones' from the sack.
 He chopped of one end and gave it to Hilderich, then got out the last and
 did the same.
 They both drank greedily and as they went about the lip ready to start
 their descend, Amonas told Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Remember, once we find the keystone, we continue down to the base.
 We need water, and you'll feel it yourself in a pretty bad way before long.
 The suns here are scorching hot, we'll need shadow, water and sleep once
 we get down.
 Then we search around the base.
 Like we agreed.
 Is that alright Hilderich?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was hesitant, almost reticent to answer but at length he must
 have thought about it in a more sensible way; he nodded and started climbing
 down carefully but briskly.
 Hilderich was making good speed having noticed that going down was much
 easier because one could easily slide across the surface of the steps with
 his bottom and then dangle his feet before making a little jump onto the
 step below, and so on.
 It might have even been a fun, merry activity, especially if they were
 children and if the sun wasn't trying to boil them alive.
 Amonas found out Hilderich's unorthodox way of descending the steps to
 be quite efficient and fast, so he copied it and they were both making
 good progress, rapidly going down the steps.
 At each step Hilderich would peer left and right quickly but certain enough
 that not a glimmer of the keystone had caught his eye.
 Amonas had advised him to stop talking and breath through his nose; he
 could tell him all about what he had come up with when they got down.
 It was supposedly a good way to conserve one's water, but Hilderich at
 one point couldn't resist to tell Amonas:

 in the lead.

 cried out:

Amonas stopped to look as Hilderich ran across the step towards the keystone.
 He knelt down and seemed to examine it closely from every side, look for
 signs of damage or any chipping he might hope to collect.
 Instead he found a perfectly shaped keystone, and what appeared to be a
 small dent on the steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It appeared quite strange to him that the keystone could actually do that,
 if the stone was indeed the cause for the dent.
 It perplexed him at a time when he thought he had most things figured out.
 It didn't seem that important, but it was too strange to completely disregard
 under the circumstances.
 He let the thought go for the moment and when he stood upright again he
 was smiling, waving his hand with the keystone tightly gripped in it, crying
 out to Amonas:

Amonas was indeed glad to hear such news but he was not sharing Hilderich's
 enthusiasm.
 He had yet to understand the importance of the stone.
 The only thing that stood to reason and supported some of Hilderich's claims
 was that someone, most probably the Castigator's people, had been collecting
 keystones in every way.
 It had even cost Olom his life, and perhaps other lives had been lost in
 a similar manner as well.
 Perhaps, the keystones were parts of an ancient technology that had yet
 to be made to work again.
 Perhaps not all keystones were as important, and some were quite different,
 unique.
 Perhaps they were all unique in some unfathomable way.
 He couldn't know, and he couldn't imagine what it was that Hilderich had
 come up with.
 It would all remain a mystery until they could get back.
 He reminded himself that first and foremost, he had to get back.
 `And right now,' he thought, `I have to keep myself from drying out'.
 They continued their descent with a bit more speed, now that Hilderich
 had secured the keystone.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The sun had taken its toll on them; they were sweating profusely, their
 bodies glimmering with perspiration.
 By now, they had both been sun-burnt, their skins bordering the color of
 the flesh underneath it.
 Hilderich seemed to be in a much sorrier state than Amonas, his every movement
 by now painfully evident on his face.
 Each thrust of pain from his limbs made him flinch in reflex and aggravate
 his pain, the skin of his face wrinkled and coarse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas came to his side and tried to help him a bit, lending some of his
 strength for Hilderich to go down the stairs.
 At first he seemed glad to be offered some relief, but then he cried in
 pain and nodded imperceptibly to Amonas to leave him be.
 Before he resumed his painful descent, he told him:

Alright, Hilderich.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas was cut in mid-sentence when Hilderich collapsed from what must have
 been a deadly mixture of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and searing pain.
 He lunged forward head over heels, his hands gnawing at the air for an
 instant as if trying to catch some invisible ropes, and then they fell
 limp together with the rest of his body.
 Amonas did not have time to react like before and this time Hilderich went
 tumbling down the steps in a state of unconsciousness with no control over
 his fall.
 He fell badly on the first step with his chest thudding on impact, and
 then his body swivelled slightly to one side before he rolled down two,
 maybe three steps until he came to a stop, his limbs sprawled at nearly
 impossible angles.
 Amonas feared the worst and came rushing down the steps as fast as he could
 without challenging a similar fate.
 The way Hilderich had fallen, Amonas thought he might have broken almost
 every bone in his body.
 He hoped his head was as intact as it seemed and that he would be able
 to move him.
 When he got there, Hilderich was not communicating.
 He tried crying out to him, but he could not rouse him.
 He was definitely unconscious, probably the reason why he had collapsed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He did not know which bones on Hilderich's body were broken but nothing
 seemed to jut out gruesomely, meaning that if something was broken it was
 not visibly so.
 He tried to feel Hilderich's arms and legs as well as his ribs, but he
 was not an expert man of medicine and he could not make any serious assessment.
 He believed his arms and legs were fine, but some of his ribs felt funny
 and might be broken.
 He would be in pain when he woke up, but he could still probably walk,
 Amonas thought.
 Under the circumstances, he felt he should be counting Hilderich's blessings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With strenuous effort he managed to lift Hilderich's waist on his right
 shoulder, his body laid out so as to least burden his probably broken ribs.
 Amonas' movements became difficult and strained; Hilderich's limp body
 seemingly protested at every move with his feet and legs getting in the
 way, uncomfortably sliding along the steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas felt very close to collapsing himself under the strain and the heat
 but he pushed on heedlessly nevertheless, trying to make it to the tree-line
 which was only a few dozen feet away.
 He was going down the last steps when Hilderich started coming around,
 moaning deeply from the numbing pain.
 He managed to croak a whisper while wheezing, the trouble with his breathing
 more than evident:

 He sounded literally dried out:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was silent again.
 Amonas thought he might have fainted again, but that was not his principle
 care.
 They had to make it to the tree-line and the little shadow it offered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was walking over the canal-like indentation on the ground, nothing but
 tall grass around him.
 Amonas was dragging his feet with admirable effort and determination.
 His face was contorted from the pain of his aching muscles and the extra
 weight they had had to carry for these last few minutes.
 `A little while longer,' Amonas kept thinking to himself, `a little while
 longer into the shadow, and I can rest'.
 He closed his eyes and kept on walking with the same pace, Hilderich slung
 over his shoulder like game; Amonas was gritting his teeth, his breaths
 coming in short and hard gasps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When at last he reached the relative shadow of the trees he could still
 feel the heat, but the scorching rays of the sun were gone as if kept at
 bay by the forest.
 With one last bit of effort, he knelt down to the ground and offloaded
 Hilderich as carefully as he could.
 Hilderich came to for a moment, moaned deeply and grimaced with pain, and
 then he was out cold again.
 His breathing was shallow, as if his body knew anything more would hurt
 him like stabs of red hot iron in his lungs.
 Amonas then braced Hilderich from under his armpits with both arms trying
 not to cause him any more pain, and dragged him over to the large trunk
 of a tree propping him up against it so he could breathe without fear of
 drowning in his own blood.
 He felt he could do nothing more for Hilderich for the time being, so he
 crawled a bit farther away under the shadow of a tree with a bark as wide
 as the wall of a mountain cabin.
 He closed his eyes and just slept without dreaming a single thing.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He opened his eyes to the sight of the green canopy: a labyrinth of shades
 of green, large and small branches criss-crossing it like a net cast out
 onto a sea of leaves.
 His mouth was parched and he felt his head heavy; a headache was pounding
 on his mind like a hammer on an anvil.
 He was thirsty, he needed water.
 Hilderich was still unconscious just laying where Amonas had left him,
 his breathing laborious; it was a raspy, unhealthy sound.
 He needed a doctor.
 They needed to get back to civilization, back home, more than ever.
 Amonas judged Hilderich was in no shape to walk around the base of the
 pyramid.
 Their most immediate need was water though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He stood up with a lot of effort.
 He felt disoriented, his senses failing him; his vision was slightly blurry
 and unfocused.
 He misjudged the location and distance of things around him.
 The dehydration must have been more severe than he had felt, and the heat
 was only making things worse.
 He slowly paced himself through an opening in the vegetation, a path that
 offered less thick greenery and easier terrain.
 He was looking for the usual tree with the brown nut-fruit, the one with
 all the watery juice inside, but couldn't see any.
 The trees looked a bit different, as if this was another part of the forest:
 they were not as thick, with more space in between them.
 Fewer but larger trees, wider openings and more space overhead.
 It looked almost like a vast hall, supported on wooden pillars of green
 and brown hues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But no fruit.
 Or something else familiar to eat and most importantly, no water.
 He could still make out the clearing in front of the base of the pyramid
 where Hilderich lay.
 He had not gotten very far though he already felt tired, worn out.
 The dehydration was severe now.
 He paused and sat by the exposed root of a tree.
 He thought it was too dangerous to venture farther away from the pyramid
 and Hilderich.
 He was looking up: a vast net-like congregation of saplings extended from
 one tree to the other, like ropes meant to build a bridge.
 They could be carrying water or some juice but he could not reach them:
 they were too high up.
 He'd need to try and climb up a tree like a mad cat and he was certainly
 in no condition to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He then turned to the thick root he was sitting up against.
 It looked healthy and vital, not gnarled like most that he had seen so
 far.
 A young root, a young tree.
 There should be some water flowing through it, he thought.
 He brought out his knife and tried to put a stab to the root, deep enough
 to go through its skin to the veins of the tree.
 Hopefully some water would pour out, at least enough for him to drink now
 and make him able to go on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He stabbed as hard as he could and then worked his knife inside, twisting
 and bending it as if trying to cut out the tree's heart.
 At length, pieces of the root came out with a strong, pungent smell and
 something like oil glistened on the knife's blade.
 Amonas ran a finger on it and sampled it, the taste woody and bitter.
 It felt indeed more like oil rather than water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With some more effort and his head now feeling like a ministry bell tolling
 incessantly, he dug deeper into the root trying to get past its meaty part
 into its core, where water coursed.
 He dug with his knife and his hands, feeling the oil giving way to moist,
 soft wood matter.
 Another jab of his blade and he saw a trickle coursing down, dripping on
 the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With sudden greed, he put his mouth on the wound he had inflicted on the
 root and sucked like a newborn child does from its mother's tit: it was
 water after all.
 He wet his lips and his mouth thoroughly, letting the cool liquid refresh
 his mouth and then spitting it out.
 He then let the trickle fill the two flasks he was carrying drop by drop,
 waiting patiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All the while he sat more comfortably leaning against the trunk of the tree,
 almost as if he were ready to take a nap.
 He swallowed small portions of the water in his mouth, savoring it.
 He had been dehydrated before, and knew it was a lot worse if a man that
 had been denied of water for too long just dived straight in a lake or
 drank to his heart's content.
 He had seen men die of it, for reasons he could not know.
 He thought it was a sick way of nature to make men pay for their greed
 as well as their lack of respect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His mind did not wander or drift as it had done so in the days before.
 Necessity and his instincts drove him.
 He took in things as they were, his mind enjoying a numbness while both
 it and his body recuperated slowly, the effects of dehydration slowly withering
 away and vigor reappearing in his face with his head throbbing gently instead
 of being about to explode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once the flasks were filled to the brim, he had drank a couple more mouthfuls.
 He was feeling markedly better, and he believed he could find a similar
 root if he wandered some more; with no way to carry more water though,
 it would be in vain.
 So he decided to get back to Hilderich and tend to him: he would rouse
 him and offer him some badly needed water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he got back to where Hilderich was sitting he tried speaking to him
 and gently shook his head, but to no avail.
 He then used some of the water letting it run down on Hilderich head, face,
 and back, dousing him carefully so as not to waste a lot of it.
 The cool water had more effect.
 Hilderich fluttered his eyes momentarily and then gasped; a sting of a
 pain immediately ran through him, the bones in his ribs stabbing him without
 warning.
 Amonas offered him the flask of water and told him in a soothing, reassuring
 manner:

Breathe lightly, or it'll hurt like death each time.
 You have broken some ribs, that much is certain.
 You are dehydrated, your head must spin and hurt like someone hit it with
 a mallet.
 I am dehydrated as well, only I just drank some water and feel good enough
 to stand on my two feet.
 Now, you just sip some of this very slowly and carefully.
 Don't gulp down on it, it might kill you; I'm serious.
 I'm not known for my humorist streaks.
 Now flex your arms and legs a bit if you can, you've been lying there for
 hours: your muscles will go dead stiff if you don't.
 We'll wait it out, you'll drink till you feel a bit better and then perhaps
 I can make you a splint out of some wood I might rummage.
 How does all that sound?

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich managed to lift his head and look at Amonas briefly.
 He was evidently in a lot of pain, and in a pretty poor state.
 He needed genuine rest and this was not the place for it.
 He nodded silently in acknowledgement, and Amonas smiled encouragingly
 before adding:

 rasped in a low whisper:

 He managed to say something else after he had sipped on some water:

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich was insisting that Amonas listened to what he had to say, tugging
 his cloak with a grip that belied his feebleness and injuries.
 He spoke with a rasp, his throat still too dry for comfort:

Amonas furrowed his brow intensely, puzzled at what seemed a very vague
 half-statement especially when coming from Hilderich.
 He motioned Hilderich to shush himself, putting a finger to his mouth but
 Hilderich went on, after coughing what appeared to be blood in his sputum:

Hilderich gave off another cough and a splutter of bloody saliva forced
 him to look away from Amonas.
 He then turned his face again to look into Amonas eyes and wheezed while
 breathing harshly.
 Hilderich insisted with what seemed to be aggravation in his voice, even
 annoyance:

Hilderich's face was suddenly contorted, wildly disfigured from anger and
 despair at the same time.
 With a jerk of his hand he threw the open flask Amonas had proffered away,
 spewing its precious water content along its flight.
 He was now talking fast with anger in his voice, pain underlining every
 word and gasping for air between every phrase:

Amonas made a backwards step, like being physically pushed and had to re-balance

 He felt like he had been lied upon, whereas he had trusted Hilderich almost
 unflinchingly:

 He told him slowly and painfully, with fear and real anger showing on his
 face and voice:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He coughed once more with blood spewing forth, running down his lips and
 chin.
 Amonas thought he could perhaps indulge him and his effort alone might
 bring some sense into him.
 He nodded without genuine assent, stoop upright and walked to where the
 flask had landed.
 He picked it up, exchanged strenuous looks with Hilderich and carried on
 to meet the wall of the pyramid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he reached it, he felt the sun blazing hot upon him but took some time
 to study it.
 He could not hope to really understand to what purpose it had been made,
 the fiery bolt that ran through the horns only adding to the puzzle.
 The black matte stones were strange: glass-like to the touch, but hard,
 not brittle.
 Not much of all that had transpired made any sense though, either.
 So he just did as Hilderich told him: he took the keystone and placed its
 longest side flat on the stone that stood right in front of him that formed
 the first step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Nothing happened, as it was expected of something that the delusional mind
 of a seriously injured man had come up with.
 For the sake of doing a friend a favor and carrying out the idea to the
 letter, he pushed the keystone down with one hand; something that made
 him feel quite unwarrantably stupid.
 As he pressed down momentarily he somehow felt the stone below give way.
 He let go, and then used his index finger to press ever so lightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Nothing that his senses could grasp ensued and kept on pressing slightly
 harder and harder, when after a certain threshold the keystone indeed seemed
 to bury itself gradually inside the black stone.
 To his untold surprise, once he had indeed pressed it halfway deep into
 the black stone, the green keystone lit up with a rainbow of colors cast
 from an inner light that could not have been a reflection of the pale bluish
 suns.
 It was as if somehow the stone had come alive.
 Unable to contain his surprise and sudden enthusiasm, Amonas started yelling
 back towards Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The flaring lights suddenly stopped and the keystone remained inert, half
 way there into the black surface of the pyramid's blocky stone step.
 Amonas did not know what to do next.
 An instinctive fear raced through his mind, preventing him from even moving
 or thinking.
 He stood there almost impassively, fearing the unknowns that he had been
 hunting down.
 It was ironic that now that he was able to actually progress past theory,
 thought and conjecture into something that seemed to work, he had frozen
 still from his basic, human fear of the unknown.
 He knew he had to focus his mind and force himself past such notions.
 With his indecision hidden away, he touched the half-buried keystone one
 more time with his palm, and then it was gone, like it had been swallowed
 up by the blackness of the stones alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Then the most amazing thing he had seen, only comparable with the fireball
 from before, unraveled before his eyes with astonishing speed and breathtaking
 complexity.
 The stones in front of him became somewhat transparent, letting only some
 of the light through.
 Their smooth surface became crystallized and faceted; rough, but not coarse
 or random.
 It looked rather like wrinkled paper that had been carefully folded a thousand,
 a million times and then laid out again, perfectly patterned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The stones started to part and dissolve, each little facet absorbed by the
 facets next to it, as if the stones were eating themselves away.
 The sight reminded him of a half-frozen lake being shattered and the ice
 sinking down instead of floating, though in a very fast and methodical
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
This transfiguration, this certain proof of the otherworldliness of the
 place, was over before Amonas could even blink twice.
 And what was left in the place of the stones was a perfect oval corridor,
 wide enough and tall enough for a man of Amonas size to walk in.
 He was stunned, unable to fully comprehend what it was that he had witnessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With some effort he gathered his wits and cast aside the protests of his
 mind to see, hear, touch and wonder wide-eyed at this inexplicable, majestic
 building that challenged reason at every opportunity.
 He focused on the harsh reality and its necessities, and peered over the
 half-lit entrance that had not been there moments before.
 He could see no lights coming from within, no other sort of emplacements
 or provisions for torches or the like.
 It was pitch black in there, but the important thing was that it was now
 open.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Instinctively, he thought about the newly built entrance closing suddenly
 in a manner similar to how it had been opened and trapping him inside or,
 even worse, trapping half of him inside.
 He made two quick steps back as if he had been warned in advance, but nothing
 happened.
 He shook his head in disbelief and disapproval.
 There was a way in and Hilderich was right.
 They had to move inside now, and that meant moving Hilderich as well.
 That would be troublesome, Amonas thought as he made quite a few steps
 backwards before turning to run to Hilderich, almost unable to let the
 sight of the wondrous entrance depart from his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was still propped up against the trunk of the tree, wheezing as
 he drew breath with painstaking effort.
 Amonas noticed he was grinning now though, and his spirits flared high
 anew.
 With a broad smile he knelt next to Hilderich and said:

Amonas face turned into ash and froze at that question.
 In the tumult, amidst all the surprise and awe he had forgotten all about
 the keystone that had just disappeared into the stone.
 That made him uneasy.
 He licked his lips with his tongue, and tasted his sour sweat.
 He had no answer that might quieten Hilderich's fear, so he simply told
 him:

No.
 It went into the stone, the entrance into the pyramid opened, and that
 was all.
 The keystone did not reappear.
 I'm sorry.
 I think it has served its purpose.

Hilderich's face lit up somewhat and then he burst into a painful mix of
 choked laughter and blood-sputtering coughing.
 He tensed up and restrained himself, the pain from his broken ribs becoming
 unbearable while he laughed.
 He grimaced while the waves of pain coursing through him settled down.
 He took a shallow breath and replied to Amonas who was now sitting down
 with his legs woven together, looking quite perplexed because of Hilderich's
 strange reaction:

Amonas face relaxed and he seemed to accept Hilderich's thoughts as if they
 made sense.
 In any other context he would have believed the man was still making up
 things in his mind, but he now felt indeed compelled to take Hilderich's
 every word seriously.
 He couldn't know why, but he had been right so far.

Alright, Hilderich.
 Now we have to figure a way to get you inside as well.

 back then.
 How are you feeling? Have you had any more water to drink? If there's no
 water left I can always go back and hack at some root, fill up the flasks.

Amonas waved Hilderich's last remark away with one hand and looked him up
 and down, thoughtfully as if measuring him.
 Then he looked around him, trying to identify something around him within
 sight that he could put to good use.
 After taking some time to think, he asked Hilderich with a certain degree
 of hesitation:

Will a sort of harness do? Something I could wrap under your armpits, around

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich looked at his feet sprawled as they were, his vision evidently
 out of focus.
 He seemed lost in thought but then he coughed with traces of blood in his
 saliva and replied to Amonas:

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas nodded with a slightly comforting smile and hurried away, headed
 to a cluster of trees and bush that Hilderich could not clearly make out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich's body was constantly assaulted from the heat and moisture that
 had only been bearable under the shadow of the bullhorn pyramid.
 With his ribs now broken, his skin sun-burnt and his body dehydrated he
 felt like someone had left out his mind to dry over white hot sand and
 stone.
 Every breath felt like he had been dismantled and put back somehow wrong,
 the bones in his ribs turned into blades set against his insides, stabbing
 him at every chance they got.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His throat felt like a dusty canyon and what little saliva was left in him
 was bloody and thick.
 He needed more water, that was true.
 But more than anything else he needed to get in there.
 Get in the pyramid.
 See for himself.
 After all, he thought, Amonas could not make it without him, he'd have
 no chance to understand what surrounded him.
 In his sorry state, they both needed each other, more badly than ever before.
 He decided to wait for Amonas and in doing so, slowly, and despite the
 constantly painful and irritating coughing, he fell asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas woke him up, gently shaking his leg.
 He woke up without really wanting to and saw Amonas had indeed prepared
 a sort of harness, a piece of paraphernalia that must have been tacked
 together while he was asleep.
 It was made out of thick strands of some kind of vine that seemed to be
 abundant, a somewhat flat branch of sappy wood, and a quite large, thick
 deep green monster of a leave, shaped like a flattened arrow's nose.
 Amonas was grinning, as if he had intended for this appurtenance of sorts
 to look like an exotic mule's rein and was certain that the irony would
 not go wasted on Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich indeed looked at what Amonas had fashioned, and though still in
 a sort of after-sleep haze he managed to point at it and snigger, as opposed
 to laughing outright which was rather painful.
 Amonas came closer and holding the various parts together told Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, I know what you're thinking since you're in such a good mood, but any
 similarity with a donkey's strap and rein is purely unintentional and simply
 a product of the same basic design principles that define both pieces of
 gear.
 I'm sure you would agree in the end, but let's try and get on with this,
 shall we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich nodded in agonizing agreement and Amonas grabbed him by the arms
 and lifted him upwards, propping him upright against the trunk of the tree.
 Hilderich let out a cry of pain as his ribs jarred his insides once more.
 Amonas tried to be quick about it since he saw Hilderich was barely able
 to stand, much less walk.
 He placed the branch of wood as a backplate, a support to keep his torso,
 chest and ribs stiff and unbent to prevent further aggravating his wounds
 inside, as well as keeping the bones in place if they were to build a proper
 splint once they went back and found a doctor.
 The prospect seemed ever closer now, and filled Amonas with ardor.
 He completed fastening the gear on Hilderich, binding the ropes and setting
 the large leaf across Hilderich's back, as a sort of cushioning to ease
 the friction without which he believed he'd be unable to move him more
 than a foot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once he was finished he lowered Hilderich down to the ground again, and
 then passed the other end of the rope around his waist belt and tightened
 it.
 He said to Hilderich who was evidently uncomfortable, his arms sticking
 out in a weird fashion:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich nodded in a disgruntled fashion and Amonas then started to move
 at first rather sluggish, but soon he was able to walk slowly with Hilderich
 in tow.
 They reached the large ditch which proved somewhat of a pain because of
 the angled sides.
 Hilderich almost slipped down and Amonas barely avoided being dragged with
 him and falling head first into the ditch.
 In a similar fashion heading up the ditch put some evident strain on Amonas,
 who reached the entrance with Hilderich in tow, sweating and out of breath.
 He stopped a few steps behind the actual entrance and gestured at it with
 one hand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This is it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was still attached to Amonas via the makeshift harness, and was
 craning his neck in an effort to somehow see better inside the passageway
 that led deeper inside the pyramid.
 He told Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's go in.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas nodded in agreement and started to walk inside.
 As he reached the foot of the entrance, he noticed the passageway in front
 of him starting to flicker and shine.
 It was doing it again, the stones in the structure rearranging themselves
 like before.
 Hilderich let out a gasp of surprise and enthusiasm and asked Amonas instantly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is that what it did before? That's wondrous! It makes way for us! The passage

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
From what it looked like, the corridor was widened to more easily accommodate
 Hilderich as well.
 Amonas was surprised as well, but he wasn't feeling mesmerized this time
 around.
 He believed though that it would take him a while to greet such things
 as normal.
 Without further ado, he took a few steps more and they were soon both inside
 the pyramid proper.
 The sunlight could not reach them here and a cool fresh air greeted them.
 They were following a corridor that seemed to glow faintly from within
 its walls, strangely illuminating their way as they walked, throwing a
 spot of soft light between the harsh darkness.
 As it was they could not see very far into the pyramid, the radius of light
 comfortable enough to simply follow them, not extending beyond a few feet.
 Amonas stopped then, and asked Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was looking with amazement around the walls and the ceiling, the
 black matte stone having turned into a semi-transparent glass, the light
 casting hues and specks reminiscent of an artisan's glass-work, or a gemstone.
 It took Hilderich a while to respond to Amonas' question, but he did so
 in a gleeful voice despite the condition he was in:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Hilderich coughed then and spat some more saliva with blood.
 Amonas trudged onwards bearing Hilderich in tow and simply said:

\begin_layout Standard

Just be patient, Hilderich.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was indeed a matter of a few more minutes spent in silence and awe, before
 they reached a sullen, gloomy opening with a single column of light shattering
 the darkness.
 It illuminated a blocky metal or stone artifact, its surface a mirror with
 a bronze-like sheen.
 Amonas was astounded to see his image reflected on that surface, even while
 there was still a wide gap of shadow between them and the artifact.
 Hilderich noticed Amonas had paused and asked him in what seemed to be
 a worrisome voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas replied while still measuring their distance and looking at the block
 of stone, a monolith of sorts.
 His voice was a low whisper, like a man fearful of awakening something
 terrible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's this block made of something like stone, metal, or glass.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich went silent with thought after Amonas' answer.
 Amonas waited for Hilderich to make a remark or perhaps give him some advice,
 but he said nothing.
 Amonas said then, with some reticence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I'll just walk over there.
 If it was dangerous it wouldn't have let us in, would it?

Hilderich answered with some uncertainty trailing his words:

 assessment.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich coughed right before the last word, pain traveling up his throat.
 It felt as if it was about to choke him, his lungs burning.
 He was almost used to the pain now, but that did not make things any easier
 for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas did not reply but simply headed for the bright area where the monolith
 stood, the reflection of him on its surface beginning to look somewhat
 strange.
 He noticed it did not reflect the harness or the bulk of Hilderich that
 should have been visible.
 The reflection did not seem to grow larger the closer he came to the stone.
 It seemed to be the same size as Amonas all along, from when he noticed
 it first.
 He thought to himself he should be feeling wary by now, but all he felt
 was puzzlement and a keen sense of interest.
 Fear had not crossed his mind, which was either a good sign, or extremely
 stupid of him.
 If they were in danger, he had no such notion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was mysteriously silent, but then again his injuries made it that
 difficult to speak his mind.
 As Amonas would've thought, he should have been talking constantly since
 they had entered the pyramid, especially now with this intriguing artifact
 laid out before them.
 Hilderich then took him by surprise when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Tell me.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Light was shining down on them, bright and white, but not hurtful to the
 eyes.
 As if it poured from around them; not from the ceiling of this chamber
 or cavern the size of which they could not properly assess.
 They had noticed no echoes whatsoever, and their eyes could not see beyond
 the illuminated area around the monolith.
 They could be anywhere.
 Amonas responded, offering a simple description to Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's about twice my height, and about three feet.
 It looks black, but that's not exactly right.
 It gives off the feeling of glass, and has a bronze sheen.
 I can see my reflection on it imperfectly, like what it would look like
 through a thick sheet of cheap glass.
 I look somewhat deformed, a honey-like hue on my image.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich took a few moments to digest that information, and asked Amonas
 again:

Hilderich shuffled where he lay, and said to Amonas:

Amonas then lowered Hilderich carefully and undid the ropes.
 He unclasped the wood on Hilderich's back, and offered Hilderich his hands.
 They embraced, and Amonas gave him a questioning nod.
 Hilderich nodded in acknowledgement, and Amonas pulled him upwards hard
 and fast so as to minimize the after-effects of splintered bone against
 Hilderich's raw flesh.
 It didn't work all that well and while Hilderich was gripping Amonas' shoulders
 for support, he almost fainted from the stabbing pain; his cry seemed to
 split the silence inside the chamber in two, but still there was no echo.
 He shook his head as if trying to shake the pain away, and after a few
 more moments of shallow breathing he managed to stand on his own two feet.
 Slowly he turned around to look at the monolith himself, Amonas supporting
 him by his side.

Hilderich coughed somewhat hard, and flinched before spitting out a blob
 of bloodied sputum.
 To his amazement he saw it reach the floor and then seep through it, like
 it had been absorbed.
 A mere moment later Hilderich's reflection appeared on the slab's surface,
 as if it had always been there and simply no one had noticed.
 Amonas pointed and said:

Amonas touched the monolith without letting go of Hilderich and they vanished

 Not an echo of them remained in the silent, dark chamber.

They were comfortably seated in a white nondescript couch, in what would
 more or less pass as a commoner's room with a small table, also white in
 color.
 The predominant color of their surroundings was in fact, white, and all
 around them, an emptiness seemed to stretch.
 It was impossible to discern between sky or ceiling and the ground, since
 everything around was white.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There was no visible source of light but everything was softly lit, the
 white objects around them like the couch and the small low table casting
 the faintest of shadows.
 The effect was strangely enough, not disconcerting or disorienting.
 It all felt quite normal to them, even soothing.
 Part of their minds screeched in horror for it could not comprehend how
 they had ended up in this friendly but evidently inconceivable place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The better part of their minds though, decided to just feel comfortable
 for a change and perhaps worry about such things and details later.
 Hilderich was feeling much better, being able to move his arms and torso
 without feeling any pain.
 No bloody coughs either, no sunburns, and no dehydration.
 He was actually feeling quite fit, fitter than ever.
 He felt he could run a hundred miles without breaking a sweat.

Amonas, who was sitting beside him was similarly in the best of shapes,
 feeling well beyond normalcy.

The question is odd, but I am required to answer, indeed inclined to indulge
 your questioning nature.
 So, to answer in the same order: 'I' am part of a vast network of hyper-dimensi
onal computational self-aware matrices that effectively keep this whole
 world running.
 You could call me avatar, or thing, if you like, but that would only make
 this conversation even less intelligent.
 I do not have anything to show to you as 'myself', since what you could
 call my genuine physical form is a hyper-dense cloud of matter in an amorphous
 plasma state.
 If I did, you could possibly distinguish a small prickle of light the size
 of a hairpin.
 I like to dispense with physical form whenever possible, I find it serves
 no purpose other than easing the fears of fairly primitive cerebral cortices
 like yours.
 And to answer your third question, you could be said to exist inside the
 buffer matrix of the conveyance sub-system of Support.

 The voice went on:

Well it's not real.
 It is an energy grid field-inducing construct.
 Think of it as a temporary room for your minds.
 All this is in your mind: like a waking dream, for the sake of understanding.
 Your bodies are right now, non-existent.
 You have been disintegrated into a complete series of information.
 You have been thoroughly, digitally and quantically, deconstructed in order
 to be reconstructed at the place of your destination, which is the centron.
 The ballast vehicle will provide the actual transportation of the total

Hilderich was puzzled.
 Amonas was beyond puzzled and the total sum of unknown and impossible to
 believe or comprehend things had already overcome his tolerances.
 Instead of boiling in anger, he simply gave up and let Hilderich do the
 talking since at least he seemed to understand some of what they were being
 told.
 He lay down on the couch and closed his eyes, as if he were about to sleep.

Hilderich insisted:

The voice stopped, and suddenly the scenery around them became dark.
 Amonas was no longer lying down on a couch and he felt he was floating
 in mid-air, the darkness around him all-consuming.
 He called out to Hilderich, but no answer came.
 In an instant he saw a flashing bright well of swaths of light passing
 by him in horrific speeds.
 He could not see his hands; indeed he felt disembodied, unable to move.
 The well shot past him and now he was looking at a little bright pin prickle
 of blue light, like a lonely star at night.
 Before he could clearly see what it was, it came rushing at him and filled
 his entire field of vision, shards of ice piercing his every sense.
 A blue-white hot light engulfed him then, as if it was ready to devour
 him whole.
 He tried to shield himself, turning his back around and running.
 But he was more than unable.
 He had no body to flee with, and that was the last thought he could remember.

 Pilgrim aroused Molo from his fretful sleep with a nudge.
 Molo woke up with a gasp, his body tense, his face and palms sweaty.
 The Pilgrim thought his brother was troubled, as he had been for the last
 two nights.
 It was as if the spirits of the land and sky were not in his dreams; as
 if they did not safekeep him from the malevolence of the archenemy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would pray for his brother at dawn; he hoped something lesser was troubling
 him.
 Some lover, or a wife.
 His children, perhaps.
 He couldn't know yet, he wasn't learning his brother's tongue as fast as
 he wished.
 But he understood his brother's pilgrimage was different.
 They had taken the same path for the same reasons, but there were different
 customs to be obeyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps, his brother was unlucky enough to have a wife and children that
 he had needed to leave behind.
 Perhaps a lover was awaiting his return.
 That might be the reason he suffered at night.
 He embraced his brother's arms reassuringly, and nodded to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He started walking again, towards the direction the walking stone pointed
 to.
 The night was chilly but dry; the desert was a harsh, rocky field of red
 and brown.
 It was good enough for walking, but useless for everything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Very little was to be found in the way of a shelter, and water was as scarce
 as snow flakes in the summer.
 The land offered little more than burrowing furry creatures and small sand
 lizards in the way of eating.
 God provided, as ever, but his brother was uneasy with what they were able
 to gather.
 At first he would not even taste the food, even when cooked on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When hunger took over him though he mellowed, and grew wiser to the ways
 of God in His Holy place.
 Still, he seemed to be somewhat reserved in his adoration; somewhat aloof
 at times as if his mind wandered elsewhere.
 He could hear him sometimes speak in his native tongue, other times in
 the tongue of the Pilgrim's people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In his sleep, he talked as well.
 The Pilgrim could not make much, though he sometimes spoke of the Forge
 of Stones.
 `He is young, I'll give him that,' thought the Pilgrim and his mind echoed
 with worry: `He has not yet had the time to fully embrace God in his true,
 purest, unblemished form.
 Here, in his Holy Land, where he is most welcome, were His Truth sublimes
 us all, even rock and sand'.
 The Pilgrim felt his brother would learn though, in due time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim saw in him a fervency, an ardor.
 He saw the determined glitter in his eyes, the way he looked at the Path,
 the awe when faced with the suns setting over where His Gardens lay.
 He was worthy of the travel, and the peril.
 He was a brother sent from God, indeed.
 Though his brother's purpose was still to be revealed, the Pilgrim knew
 in his heart his own was renewed; that he should act as this man's mentor
 and tutor, as a wise and benevolent father to fill his heart and mind with
 the joy that was God and Truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim's heart burned with vigor and his mind felt inundated in these
 warm thoughts of God and His work and plan.
 He was so enthralled with what God had in stock for them both that he had
 barely noticed his brother was not walking alongside him.
 He checked behind him but he could not make out his brother's figure in
 the blooming starlight.
 `He must have fallen asleep again,' the Pilgrim thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
So he walked back over to the small sandy crest where they had curled up
 and laid themselves to sleep.
 He would be cold now that there was no god-stone to bring them light, heat
 and comfort.
 `I should have been more thorough when I woke him,' the Pilgrim thought
 while walking with a sure, easy pace, slowly climbing to the top of the
 crest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There, he saw him sleeping serenely this time.
 The Pilgrim momentarily thought he should leave him be for a little while
 longer, but night had fallen for sometime now and they had to take advantage
 of it as best as they could.
 When the suns rose again in the morning, the heat and the cloudless sky
 would make traversing the desert an insufferable affair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They should be at the Dunes come morning, where the sea of sand could claim
 a man's life if he wasn't ready for its tribulations.
 God would provide, but man should be wary as ever.
 Many Pilgrims before him perished while traversing the Dunes, and left
 nothing but bleached bones as a warning to those that came after them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim shook Molo more violently, this time making sure he would wake
 up, stand on his feet and walk with him.
 It was for their own good and the good of the Pilgrimage.
 It would not serve God if they tarried and indulged themselves.
 That was one of the lessons his brother had still to learn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo stirred and moaned a complain, something unintelligible even if the
 Pilgrim could understand his language.
 He rose from the ground wearily and languidly.
 He put a hand out as if letting the Pilgrim know he was really awake this
 time.
 He talked in low Helican, the commoners tongue, with signs of exasperation
 in his face and a disgruntled voice:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim smiled and made the hand gesture for `God will provide', turned
 around and started walking while faintly motioning Molo to follow him with
 a flick of his wrist.
 Molo sighed wearily and started walking behind the Pilgrim in a disheartened
 fashion; he was almost shuffling his feet, kicking up small clouds of fine
 dust in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim said something that Molo could not understand perfectly; something
 about the weary man finding consolation in God's plan, but he wasn't sure
 that was the proper translation.
 The man spoke High Helican, but it had somewhat mutated over the years
 probably, flex and intonation at wild variance from the original.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A strange thought came unbidden to Molo then: he thought that maybe it was
 the other way around, maybe the High Helican Molo had learned was the mutated
 form and not the original.
 Such linguistic considerations though mattered little since the only thing
 the man ever talked about was God, his plan, and this Pilgrimage he was
 on.
 That was alright with him; he didn't really care if the Pilgrim was a half-mad
 ascetic fanatic, as long as he brought him to the Necropolis.
 Then, he would see what he might do with him.
 Perhaps he knew more than he let on from time to time about the place.
 He talked of gardens and a citadel, and a forge of some kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He'd stick around, as long as the Pilgrim proved his usefulness.
 If they ever got there, that was.
 They had been wandering farther into the desert for a couple of days now.
 They had left the marble road behind two nights before, and that was about
 the time when Molo had run out of food.
 Perhaps the man had saved their lives, with his uncanny ability to find
 sustenance in such a forlorn and inhospitable place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Though lizards and rats were not real food, it somehow became agreeable
 when one had not eaten in three days and the smell of cooked meat wafted
 into the nostrils.
 Molo shuddered at the memory of the Pilgrim cutting the lizard's head off,
 skinning it, and eating it raw, from limb to limb.
 The man was a savage, that much was certain, but he somehow knew more about
 the Widelands than any man alive.
 He had only identified himself as `Pilgrim', but that much was enough for
 Molo to call him by when the need arose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were walking through a rocky desert, sometimes passing through low
 crests on the same direction.
 From what Molo could gather from where the suns rose and fell each day
 they were walking roughly towards the northeast; curiously enough that
 was one of the few things that seemed to make sense.
 The terrain had progressed from a rough savannah into a rocky desert, and
 it seemed like soon they were about to enter the great sand dunes he had
 read about in Umberth's accounts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
From then on, he'd be almost lost.
 Esphalon had written down that once they had entered the sand dunes, the
 pack mules they had brought with them died being skinned to death in a
 sand storm they themselves barely escaped alive through sheer luck and
 perhaps as Esphalon had put it, providence.
 That was when they met the girl that went on to lead them to the Necropolis
 per se, which they had failed to enter after fruitless days of labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The girl was the one who sustained them through these perils, producing
 food and water out of what seemed to be thin air.
 That was not all though: The girl was quite insistent in preventing them
 in their efforts to enter the Necropolis proper, what Esphalon had described
 as `a gargantuan cluster of megalithic buildings that either shone or absorbed
 light, tightly packed together as if they were wood on a basket, encircled
 by a wall that itself defied logic in size, shape, and function'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She had even used some kind of invisible force on them, on more than one
 occasion.
 She had began to weep and talk incessantly, begging them to halt their
 efforts, as she `pushed us away from what could have been an entrance point
 to the dead city, what Master Umberth called a Necropolis.
 She did not seem to be angry or wrathful because of our attempts but rather
 terrified, pleading with us to leave the place'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo hoped the Pilgrim would be much more helpful in that respect.
 After all, he had told him he had to enter the Holy Gardens and pay his
 respects in the Citadel of God to reaffirm his people's faith in him, and
 be rewarded with the Forge of Stones.
 Those were the exact words he had used, in heavily accented High Helican.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
To Molo that sounded like the man was planning to enter what Umberth had
 dubbed the Necropolis of the Widelands.
 Indeed, he was not simply planning on doing such a thing but was actually
 driven by a religious fervor Molo had not seen even in the Ministers of
 the Pantheon, or the most pious and faithful of the lowly people that clung
 to such notions like a man about to drown clinging on a driftwood.
 This Pilgrim though, was a different sort altogether.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His faith drove him; it inspired him, steeling his determination and making
 him unwavering in the face of adversity.
 The contrast with the Ministers of the Pantheon was sharp: they instilled
 fear, caution, piety, obeisance, and misery.
 A faithful man for Molo was a fool, a person reduced to a muttering idiot
 who felt the Gods were in his favor if his children were not taken away
 from him, and his crops were not dying of thirst or the cold of winter.
 The contrast was painfully sharp, and the effects of Pilgrim's faith on
 the psyche more than intriguing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
All around them the land was still, without even the sounds of scurrying
 desert rats or the rush of wind from a night gale.
 All he could hear was their feet on dirt and sand, and perhaps the sound
 of gravel as they trod their feet over rough patches of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He noticed how much his boots were worn out by now.
 It was not the many miles he had traveled until he met the marble road
 that had made them so.
 It was the relatively few days he had been walking in the Widelands that
 had made him feel he should've packed a pair of boots with him.
 The hot days and chilly nights had put some stress on the boot's leather
 skin, but it was mainly due to the pervasive asperity of this place, this
 outer desert, and the abrasive nature of the rocky ground; the mix of dust,
 sand, dirt and gravel that had made his boots little less than sheets of
 leather about to slit themselves open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It remained a mystery to Molo how the Pilgrim could remain unperturbed by
 the roughness of the terrain, the adverse conditions, and the unforgiving
 miles he had walked to get here in the first place.
 As far as Molo knew, the Pilgrim's people were nomads living in the cold,
 harsh tundras of a northern island.
 It was understandable that he would be proficient in survival skills, but
 his ability to adapt to changes in climate and terrain seemed unrivaled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But there were also the strange stones Molo had noticed the Pilgrim carried
 with him.
 These were small stones but regularly shaped, as if they were purposefully
 cut by human hands.
 They were dark green, with violet and cyan lights flashing in the morning
 suns, their surface smooth but with mysterious shapes looming right below
 it, like patterns that kept changing each time you looked at one.
 They closely resembled what Molo had known as keystones, though he had
 never really gotten his hands on one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim used one of the stones as a guide, for getting his direction
 straightened out.
 Molo had noticed that every time the Pilgrim used it, always after offering
 praise to his God and praying, he slightly changed course as if adjusting
 to what the stone showed him.
 Molo deduced that the stone was able to point him somehow to the direction
 of the Necropolis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had briefly entertained the idea of killing the Pilgrim and getting the
 guiding stone for himself.
 He had decided against such an action though because he believed the Pilgrim
 would be much more useful when they actually entered the Necropolis.
 The other stone he used was entirely fascinating as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was what the Pilgrim used for shelter in this forsaken land, and probably
 something his people also used to stay alive in the harsh tundras of the
 north.
 The stone was a marvelous object: It offered them a small glowing light,
 enough to see each other's face in the dark, and it exuded warmth but unlike
 a fire, the warmth did not seem to radiate from the stone.
 It felt as if they were enclosed in a bubble of sorts where pleasant warmth
 occupied it, and the sounds and the wind outside were kept at bay as if
 by magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Indeed each time the Pilgrim used it, it was as if they were suddenly put
 inside an invisible bubble of glass that was protective and mindful of
 their basic comfort.
 From what he had seen, he believed that whatever the conditions outside,
 such a stone could keep them warm and dry; it was exactly what a body would
 need to stay alive in any climate.
 Molo sniggered at the thought of such a fantastic artifact of mysterious
 origins and unheard of qualities as that stone, in the hands of a savage
 that could barely use a wheel, if in fact he had ever seen one in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But Molo felt there was probably so much more he could learn from the Pilgrim.
 So many mysteries that could be unraveled just because the Pilgrim knew
 these things, like he had always known them.
 As if it were rote, custom, and legend that was passed on from generation
 to generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo thought more about how the Pilgrim had introduced himself at first,
 and remembered that he had referred to himself as `a' Pilgrim.
 Which meant that there were others as well.
 Or there had been others in the past.
 He had not broached the subject because when he did ask the Pilgrim about
 things, even about relatively simple things like what they would eat or
 when would they stop for a break, the answers he received were nothing
 short of enigmatic, occluded by religious reverence and pious deference
 to God and his plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo believed that asking him about his Pilgrimage was a bad idea; the dark-skin
ned man would erupt in a series of prayers and gestures, reciting long stories
 of tradition as well as many other minutiae that would only complicate
 his efforts at understanding whatever useful information and knowledge
 he could offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He believed that it was best he gathered what the Pilgrim would share without
 knowing, and infer whatever knowledge he could from scraps of information
 alone.
 When the time came perhaps Molo could press him for more, or do away with
 him outright.
 He did not think the Pilgrim could be extorted through fear or driven to
 betray his beliefs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even if his life was forfeit, he would rather think himself as a martyr:
 a holy failure.
 In that regard, Molo had to endure his presence and learn as much from
 him as possible through what little interaction they had.
 Truthfully though, Molo did not think he would have been able to survive
 the tribulations of the desert had it not been for the Pilgrim and his
 stones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim had turned around to check up on how far behind he was.
 He noticed Molo was grinning, and smiled with puzzlement and naivety.
 Molo took the chance to build more of a rapprochement with the Pilgrim,
 something he could perhaps use later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He remembered that according to Esphalon, the nights when Pyx, the brightest
 star in the sky hung low in the sky, were held as having special significance
 to his people for some reason he had not stayed long enough to decipher
 and understand.
 He had noted down how they paid homage though, which was by turning to
 face Pyx, kneel down with folded arms and kiss the ground.
 Luck, it would seem was smiling to him: Pyx was flaring bright and low
 in the horizon.
 He turned to face the lone star and went through the motions as well as
 he remembered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he rose again, he saw that the Pilgrim was wearing a sad expression
 on his face, as if he had seen a sorrowful sight.
 It was an unexpected reaction that made Molo try to copy his sullen mood,
 as if such was the appropriate thing to do.
 He suddenly looked solemn and respectful, just like the Pilgrim.
 The Pilgrim simply told him a single word: `apalgos'.
 He then bowed his head and made the sign of God, and resumed his walk as
 none of that had ever happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo had not known that word.
 He had never seen it in scripts or texts, and it seemed to have no other
 common root or sound like anything he could understand.
 It was as if the word was new, or his vocabulary was incomplete.
 It baffled him, and made a mental note to himself to perhaps ask the man
 to describe it later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had seen how the Pilgrim had reacted when he had in error used the word
 `Gods' instead of `God', and he had instantly known the Pilgrim was a dangerous
 fanatic.
 It would not serve him well to have to kill him if he ever found out he
 was not really a fellow believer.
 He used the word `our' when referring to God, as well as 'brother' and
 'believer' when referring to Molo, who had never thought that learning
 High Helican would ever come to be of such a use in his quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim on the other hand, felt he understood his brother better.
 Everything made much more sense to him, if the man was on a journey of
 sorrow.
 It was only natural if he was grieving that he'd be troubled in his sleep,
 though aloof sometimes, disenchanted and forgetful in his devotions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In a way, the Pilgrim thought, the Pilgrimage was even harder on his brother
 who had lost a loved one.
 It was indeed a mixed sign for the Pilgrim: a grieving man on the Land
 of God that needed guidance and help to make it through alive and be free
 of his sorrow, alongside a Pilgrim that needed a focus lest he stray from
 the path of Truth, and fail his people and his God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had not heard of such a Pilgrimage before.
 He felt like the starlight shone upon him with the brightness of his God's
 light.
 He felt inundated with honor and love, but he was wary of such sudden rushes
 of strong feelings, and breathed slowly, carefully rearranging his thoughts
 and feelings to protect him from the sins of pride and arrogance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was in God's hand alone the manner in which his Pilgrimage would take
 place, and that was all that he needed to know.
 It did not mean he was special.
 It meant that he carried a special burden, and had a special purpose in
 life.
 Himself, he was but a man of God, as was his brother.
 They both had their reasons to walk this path.
 He felt reassured now, and he troubled his mind with such thoughts no more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They walked in silence from then on, until their legs were sore and their
 throats dry.
 In the middle of the night, with nothing but the stars to shine upon their
 eyes reveling in their divine solitude, the Pilgrim stopped walking and
 gestured for Molo to do the same with a repetitive downward motion of his
 hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He did not like to use the words of God in His Holy Land in vain, or for
 mundane things such as simple communication.
 He found out the hand gestures and nods were enough, and his brother understood
 what he meant most of the time.
 Sometimes his brother spoke in this other tongue of his: a somewhat crude,
 harsh tongue, that seemed to resemble the Holy Tongue somewhat, but was
 far from it.
 Maybe it was a way to speak a form of his tongue without speaking the Holy
 Tongue vainly.
 Maybe their tribe was older and their customs still clung to the time before
 the Purge whereas they, the God's chosen children, had been instructed
 in different ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was a miracle indeed to find another believer, another man of God, whose
 people had survived the Purge so far away.
 The wise men had always said that God works in mysterious ways, and lo
 and behold, a brother long lost is found wandering in God's Holy Land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But it was real, as real as his purpose; as real as the True Path, as real
 as anything he had believed in since he was born.
 He was sitting down with his legs crossed while all those feelings of certain
 faith and the warm knowledge of God's plan working so delicately through
 him had left him with a smile on his face and tears welling in his eyes.
 He held those tears, feeling he would be misjudged by his brother and that
 would only serve further to his befuddlement, whereas he should be enlightening
 him by his actions alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim offered Molo his leather flask which was filled with water they
 had gathered from a meaty, barbed plant, its juices nothing more than water.
 Molo accepted the flask with a nod, sipped cautiously and dived in a sea
 of thoughts.
 It seemed to Molo that soon they would be entering the real no man's land,
 where nothing ever grew, and the only change was the shifting of the dunes,
 slaved forever to the whims of the wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Esphalon's tales of that part of the Widelands, the inner desert, were sparse
 and yielded little information.
 They were mainly concerned about the lack of water and the sandstorm that
 had almost killed them and denied them of most of their supplies and all
 their animals.
 It was a race for survival, and the telling of Esphalon focused more on
 how they expected their lives to come to an end day by day rather than
 anything really useful about survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was the girl that had actually saved them.
 He would have to trust the Pilgrim for their survival.
 Unfortunately, he had not yet seen yet the Pilgrim use a stone that would
 produce food or water like the girl in Esphalon's account presumably did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He strongly believed that the Pilgrim was somehow prepared for the ordeal.
 It was ironic, Molo thought, that a man like himself who bore a grudging
 disbelief against all sorts of divine creatures and indeed faith itself
 had such a strong belief in a man wholly devoted to a fantastic person,
 a myth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim rose and asked for his flask.
 Molo drank once more, a greedy gulp running down his throat, refreshing
 and invigorating, exactly what he needed for the rest of the walk.
 They seemed to have a few hours until the suns rose, and from their unusually
 prolonged period of rest Molo assumed the Pilgrim was not planning on making
 any other stops, not anytime soon.
 That was just as good since the more they walked through this landscape,
 the less time they would have to spend in this treacherous desert, and
 the sooner they would arrive at their destination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They started off once more and trudged onwards, Molo right behind the Pilgrim.
 They were silent again as ever and after a couple of hours, weariness and
 boredom overcame Molo.
 His pace lessened and soon the distance between him and the Pilgrim began
 to grow.
 The Pilgrim took notice at some point, paused, and urged him onwards gesturing
 with his arms and head.
 He pointed at the horizon that was starting to colour itself crimson.
 It meant that dawn was near, and they'd soon stop, rest and sleep.
 Molo gathered what little of his stamina remained, and with painful effort
 picked up his pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In a matter of minutes, the suns would make their bright entrance and wash
 away the night completely.
 The Pilgrim stopped then, and beckoned Molo to come and sit next to him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were atop a rather wide crested hill of rock and dirt, coarse sand
 covering its ridge.
 Molo indulged the Pilgrim and as he climbed the last few feet, he could
 see the sand dunes before him eating away at the horizon, their crests
 like waves of sand with their ever-changing nature imperceptible to the
 naked eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A thin line of blood red, sun yellow and sea blue hung between the sky and
 the desert.
 It was the break of dawn and the Pilgrim seemed to marvel at the sight,
 which Molo could not help thinking was indeed a sight to leave one speechless.
 The Pilgrim made his morning prayers and Molo followed suit, as had been
 the case since they had met on the marble road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He then started looking around him as if searching for something that he
 had dropped.
 He moved over to a patch of sand a few steps away and with deliberate movements
 of his hands, he began digging into the sand with his bare hands.
 Molo frowned in puzzlement at this weird behavior, which topped everything
 the man had done so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo was even more surprised when the man briefly paused digging, turned
 around and nodded to Molo for help.
 Molo could not imagine the purpose of the Pilgrim's toils and he thought
 this entire scene to be acutely comical; it would have made him laugh profoundl
y if he had not been part of it.
 He acquiesced though, and soon enough found himself to be digging right
 beside the Pilgrim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Within a few moments, he felt the sand damp under his palms.
 Perhaps there was reason in this, and the reason was water.
 Soon enough a grin formed on his face while the Pilgrim remained apathetic,
 almost indifferent.
 They had dug out a small hole in the sand, where there was enough water
 to fill their flasks and perhaps drink a handful each.
 It was downright astonishing that the man simply peered through the sand
 and found a spot where water could be found barely two feet deep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He could have never guessed such a thing for the life of him.
 The Pilgrim was proving his value to Molo with each passing day and he
 couldn't help but feel genuine respect for the man, even though he suspected
 there had to be some aid from the stone, albeit he had not seen him use
 one right then and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When their flasks where filled and they had some water to drink, the Pilgrim
 motioned for Molo to sit in a somewhat flat space of sand.
 As he did so, he brought out the stone he used as shelter, and set it down
 roughly between them.
 He made the sign of god and laid himself down, with his back to Molo.
 Soon enough, the air felt pleasantly warm.
 The suns came up, two blinding spots of light walking hand in hand rising
 across a violet-blue colored sky.
 Pretty soon, daylight became too bright for the naked eye to handle but
 where the stone lay, it was pleasantly dusky, and one could actually close
 his eyes and fall asleep with ease.
 Molo noticed the Pilgrim had already done that, the outline of his rising
 and falling ribs following the rhythm of his breathing: slow, deep, and
 steady.
 Molo thought to himself he might actually leave the man be, when the time
 came.
 `After all, what harm can he do when the secrets of the Necropolis are
 laid bare to me', Molo thought.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had slept away for most of the day.
 When Molo woke up, it was to the recently-made familiar smell of cooked
 reptile meat.
 The Pilgrim was handling the roasting of the meat on his knife expertly.
 Curiously, Molo noticed for the first time it was a knife with a strangely
 fashioned two-edged blade: one was serrated and the other seemed to be
 razor sharp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The knife seemed to be made of steel or a similar metal, perhaps even silver,
 but that could not explain how it had been able to weather time without
 being reduced to little more than a useless piece of rust.
 And it seemed certainly implausible that a tribe of nomads on the brink
 of savagery could have fashioned a finely crafted blade without expert
 knowledge, foundries, forges and artisans capable of supreme craftsmanship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He concluded in his mind that the knife must be a thing of a long forgotten
 past, a treasured relic that was handed down from one generation to the
 next, indeed crafted by a civilization the likes of which had erected the
 Necropolis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was fascinating to witness an ancient relic wielded like a common utensil,
 nothing more than a tool, when it's value to knowledge and the unlocking
 of hitherto unexplainable mysteries could prove to be incalculable.
 Molo realized he had been staring at the knife for too long, his sight
 out of focus as if he was still drowsy from sleep, as if his mind raced
 to meet the dreamworld it had unjustly been forced to escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim jogged him back into reality with a slap on the shoulder that
 he must have considered an expression of brotherhood and amicability towards
 him.
 Molo noticed he was also offering him the knife with the piece of unknown
 meat on it, charred somewhat on the edges and slightly curled, as if it
 had been left to roast on the fire for too long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo thought about inquiring about the origin of the meat, but quickly his
 inquisitiveness dissipated into a forlorn hope that some of the desert
 was populated by hares or something equally less hideous than lizards.
 The smile on the Pilgrim's face assured him of how wildly imaginative he
 had become concerning food during the past few days, and grudgingly decided
 to feed on whatever the Pilgrim had caught.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In reality, he thought it was quite important to never know what it was
 that the Pilgrim had offered him, especially since it tasted so much better
 than the previous things he had been forced to taste by necessity.
 The thought of actually beginning to enjoy desert-hunted reptile wildlife
 made him shiver with disgust at himself for even thinking of abasing himself
 in such a barbaric way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Momentarily, the memory of some exquisite sauté veal liver assaulted his
 mind and he could almost smell its fine taste and texture against his palate.
 He felt certain he could kill a man for a glass of Fironian dry white.
 But all that was just tricks of the mind.
 He knew he was eating something that was meant to crawl and slither instead
 of walk, fly, or swim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The illusion though, when maintained in his mind, was a shelter for his
 mind.
 A way for him to ignore the nuances of survival and proceed to complete
 his aim, his purpose.
 On that day, he knew he was much closer.
 The sand dunes beckoned before them, and it would take much more than the
 mere lack of luxury to prevent him from the most worthwhile of goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once his hunger was satisfied, he took a swig of water from his own flask
 and rolled it around his mouth in an effort to wash down the uncannily
 chicken-like meat.
 Noticing that the eyes of the Pilgrim were lost in the sea of sand, he
 sat for a while idly gazing at the dunes, trying to make out anything worth
 noticing in the amorphous dune crests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He felt that they should be moving on right away, but the usually relentless
 Pilgrim had quietened down and was sitting still and cross-legged on the
 warm sand, the shelter stone nowhere in sight.
 To Molo, it looked as if he was basking in the light of the suns, like
 the lizard he must have deftly caught with nothing but his knife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was serene, his face almost glowing from within.
 It was like looking at a man who thought his existence was made just and
 fair by virtue of his devotion to his God, his Truth and his Path.
 Molo felt like the man was actually basking in a swath of divine light;
 his God's gift, a warm and bright light that could fill a man's soul to
 the brim, and yet could not possibly be spilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo thought those were very strange feelings, and he could not understand
 how they had suddenly appeared unbidden.
 He felt a strange kind of sympathy for the Pilgrim, one he could not put
 down in all detail.
 Something evaded him, and though such feelings were not totally unknown
 to him, he had spent a great deal of his life hurtling them aside, uncovering
 the truth underneath such deceit of the heart and soul, ascribing the true
 logic behind such manifestations of the human psyche.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In this case, he was struggling to accept the fact that he had no easy answers,
 indeed no answers at all.
 The Pilgrim was a mystery that defied Molo's reason, since he was unable
 to fathom why this man exuded this air of spirituality, of homeliness and
 trust.
 These were feelings that Molo had years ago cast aside and attributed to
 man's various futile efforts at making sense of the world and his existence,
 making up emotions along the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But here he was, a savage man with no ties to such trappings of the civilized
 man, a pilgrim that somehow managed to cripple his mind with nothing but
 a smile and a prayer.
 Perhaps, Molo thought, these were side-effects of malnourishment and dehydratio
n, a prelude to hallucination.
 There was something very strange about this Pilgrim.
 Or, he admitted reluctantly in his mind, he might have been wrong in some
 of his assertions about various things he had vowed never to revisit again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim's pull on his shoulder brought him to the world of the senses
 once more.
 He could see the falling suns, their glare losing its strength as they
 slowly glided past the sea of sand into a thin velvet horizon of scarlet
 and violet blue.
 His nostrils were assaulted by the grains of sand that were starting to
 float wildly in the air, and he felt his mouth filled with the salt of
 the earth under his feet.
 He looked towards the northeast where their path would take them and all
 he could see was the ashen gray and dull brown-yellow of what he judged
 to be a cloud made of sand.
 And they were going to walk right through it, if his sight was as clear
 as his mind at that moment.
 The notion rang a deep bell of life-threatening danger that superseded
 every other thought, feeling and intention.
 The writings of Esphalon came to his mind, where he had written down about
 the sandstorm that almost killed them and left them hapless to roam the
 desert in vain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
`..clouds the size of mountains no man had never even imagined toppled the
 reign of the suns and cast them down into the night side of the world.
 The air was suddenly thick with dirt and cold as a dead man's touch, heavy
 with the sand and stone of the desert sea.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
We made haste to what seemed like a rocky alcove in the distance, barely
 visible under the cusps of sand that harrowed the very air we drew breath
 from.
 The mules would not budge, no matter how much we pulled and pushed them.
 As the wind grew more intense and sand began to hurt our very skin, we
 had to abandon them to their fate, mindful to take as much water and food
 as haste allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
We hid under a rare rocky alcove, while a maddening storm raged just beyond
 the reach of our palms.
 A couple of feet separated us from the unwavering madness of this uncaring
 place that assaulted any form of life with the same deliberate indignation.
 For hours on end, all our senses were of no use.
 The howling sounds of the sandstorm ruled supreme, whipping the very earth,
 tormenting the sky, challenging the reign of night eternal itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When exactly the storm had died down, we knew not.
 All we could see was starlight shining upon the desert once more, as if
 nothing of import had occurred.
 It mattered not that the clean-picked bones of our mules told otherwise.
 That was the Widelands, and life had no place there.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The words of Esphalon coiled in his mind like a snake, ready to leap out
 from his mouth.
 He saw the Pilgrim was already putting some distance between them.
 He called out to him in High Helican so he could understand him without
 the need for further explanations:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The Pilgrim then turned around and looked at Molo as if he had uttered a
 nonsensical statement.
 Briefly, Molo thought he had mispronounced what he had meant to say and
 his words carried no meaning to the Pilgrim.
 A moment passed though, and the Pilgrim stroked his beard and nodded knowingly.
 He gestured for Molo to hurry up and come closer to fill the distance,
 while he set out again.
 Perhaps he had an explanation, or had already seen a place that could shield
 them from the approaching clouds that could grind anything alive down to
 the bone.
 When Molo caught up with the Pilgrim a few moments later, he grabbed him
 by the arm and forced him to stop, asking him in High Helican:

To which the Pilgrim replied with a gaze to the sky and the sign of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo was now starting to lose his temper.
 This man must be mad, he thought.
 His mind raced with the possibility that this man had indeed been mad from
 the beginning and had somehow made a journey of thousands of miles only
 to offer himself as sacrifice or something equally idiotic like killing
 himself because he had sinned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But no, that was not the case, Molo decided.
 He looked at his calm, serene face as he turned to face the sky and praise
 his God solemnly, and knew that he had a solution, he had an answer to
 their peril.
 He was certain of it, and his determination proved it somehow.
 There was nothing to be afraid, everything was accounted for.
 `It will be alright,' the thought rang true in Molo's mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It felt as if the Pilgrim was the source, the reason for these thoughts.
 He seemed now to Molo like an unyielding, irresistible beacon of hope;
 he was unmoving as a mountain and stable as rock, a haven for any troubled
 soul.
 Molo's gaze was not as hard as it had been before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He relaxed his grip on the arm of the Pilgrim, and his jaw slackened.
 The dust was beginning to swirl around them, the sand getting in their
 mouths, trying to bore through their skin.
 It was a very strange feeling for Molo, surrendering himself, body and
 mind, to an illogical concept.
 He stood there transfixed; the Pilgrim knelt down before him, facing the
 approaching sandstorm head on while all around them the makings of a whirlwind
 abounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo had mysteriously let go of his prohibitions, of his logical and analytical
 mind, of his reasoning and his fears, and just trusted the Pilgrim.
 It was all a matter of trust in the Widelands, as far as he could tell.
 And he had decided to trust the man with his life, and ultimately his purpose
 in life as well.
 Which of the two he valued most, he sincerely could not tell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim had knelt down, seeing his brother was filled with fear, worry,
 and doubt.
 It would be no different to God, for if he had deemed that he should live,
 he would live, and his brother along with him.
 If he had deemed that he should die, they would perish, and that would
 be the end of their lives, for better or for worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But to appease his brother and make him ready for the coming trial, the
 trial of their souls, he would pray.
 He would pray loudly and fervently, with ardor and passion.
 He would sing his praise to God, with all the power his lungs could muster,
 and he would ask forgiveness for their sins; known and unknown, willing
 and unwilling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would ask of his God to deliver them, but he would also offer his life
 and soul as a last service of his own volition, if so God wished.
 He would speak on behalf of his brother and plead for his salvation, body
 and soul, because he was a grieving man, born of pain and want; not a sinner
 whose mind was set, neither a blasphemer who thought himself beyond the
 reach of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He would pray until the storm had passed and their God had decreed their
 souls clean, fit for a human being.
 And his brother would pray with him.
 He turned around and saw his brother was also kneeling down with eyes closed,
 his hands buried in the sand.
 The sky was now bleak, the front of the sand storm coming to greet them
 head on, the suns drowned in its dark gray wave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He turned around then and touched his brother's arms, who was already doing
 as he should.
 He shuddered slightly at his touch and then started crying, in fervor or
 in fear, the Pilgrim could not honestly tell.
 The Pilgrim started chanting, his clear voice challenging the howls of
 the rising wind, cutting a clean path through the hurtling sands towards
 the heart of the storm.
 And the wind grew louder and stronger; the sands started to tear at their
 skin, lashing them like razor sharp tufts of steely grass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And then, while the voice of the Pilgrim went on unwaveringly, seeking God,
 asking him to reach down from where he dwelt and lift them from their grim
 fate, the suns could be seen in their last streak of light, for once more
 hiding until the morning came.
 They left behind them a lukewarm trace of violet, stars already visible
 on the edges between sky and earth.
 The storm had cleared; it had dissolved, like God had simply wished it
 away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The wind fell into a light breeze, and the sands quietened down becoming
 as still as the night that had just arrived.
 The Pilgrim made the sign of God and stood upwards, gesturing for Molo
 to follow him.
 He even offered him his hands which he rarely did, as if he thought it
 was unbecoming of a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His brother was still on his knees and had just opened his eyes.
 Without warning he saw tears running down on his cheeks, the look of a
 man who was blind and could now see again on his face.
 His brother made the sign of God, this time somehow different than before.
 It was quite possible, the Pilgrim thought, that his brother was finally
 beginning to learn how to love God properly, like any man should.

He pulled him up by his hands and they both walked away into the night.
 Now that the trial of the storm had passed they should be able to see the
 Gates by tomorrow night, with nothing but pure starlight shining upon the
 sacred walls.
 He briefly considered telling him, but he thought he already knew.
 Why else, the Pilgrim asked himself, would he be carrying no guiding stone?
 It was because he knew.
 Because God had sent him.

 Tyrpledge was riding his horse making an inspection of the City walls from
 a safe distance, his personal guard along with his adjutant following him
 from a respectful but close distance.
 He still could not believe he had been tasked with the sacking of Pyr,
 and if it came to that, its razing.
 The Castigator had been blunt in his orders and frugal in his explanations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had told him that the Patriarch was in league with a cluster of rebellious
 religious fanatics that wished for total domination of the Patriarch over
 the ruling council making the first move against peace and prosperity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A messenger had shortly arrived bearing a message from the Patriarch, citing
 that the Castigator had been deemed unworthy in the eyes of God and that
 the Noble Representative, Lord Ursempyre Remis was the new Castigator of
 the Outer Territories.
 The General was dumbstruck, utterly flabbergasted at the turn of events,
 and did not know how to react.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Castigator talked to him in earnest, urging him to uphold the Law, honor
 his rank and office, protect him and the Council as a whole and crush the
 rebels before they could take root firmly.
 Tyrpledge had asked about the Arch-minister, who had seemed a reasonable
 enough man.
 He believed he could intervene, somehow mediate, so that balance could
 be restored and things would not deteriorate into profuse madness at the
 speed of a rushing waterfall, as it seemed it definitely would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Castigator had informed him then that sadly enough the Arch-minister
 had been found dead, assassinated by the rebel scum, the henchmen of the
 unholy demon that posed as their Patriarch.
 Most of his staff were also cruelly killed, their skin flayed out to the
 bone, while the Arch-minister himself seemed to have been made the object
 of a ritual to the Deceiver, the False God.
 The Castigator expressed his demure belief that it been solely through
 divine will that he had escaped unscathed so timely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Castigator, with tears in his eyes had insisted that there was no better
 way to avenge the Arch-minister's memory other than to bring those heathen
 scum that had infiltrated their society to their knees, grind them into
 oblivion and spread their ashes in the oceans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The effect on the General was devastating; in one night everything that
 he had been taught, everything that he had built his life upon was crumbling
 down around him, around them all.
 The Patriarch, in league with rebels? Absurd! The very word had fallen
 into disuse, and was used only in an historical context of ages past, or
 in thought-provoking discussion that rarely allowed its participants to
 delve deeper into such subjects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The notion of rebellion was indeed, taboo.
 It had been so ever since he had learned how to read and write.
 He thought to himself with bitterness that he might have been spared such
 skills, but then again, how would the army live and breathe without notices,
 requisition forms, and orders in triplicate?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And the Castigator, fleeing into the night, beset on all sides by danger
 and hounds sent out for his blood? All that, the design of the Patriarch,
 with the Noble Representative aiding him? Him, the most noble of the Lords,
 ruler of a family of great tradition and honor, an arch-demon in the flesh,
 thousands of men doing his bidding like minions? `Incredulous, inconceivable,
 unimaginable,' the General had thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was only until he had seen the orders, written and signed from the Patriarch,
 to have his army stand down and ignore the Castigator before him as a traitor
 and conspirator set to overthrow the Rule of the Council; to disarm the
 men and dissolve the Army peacefully, under the watchful eye of the procrastina
tors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The letter had been signed and sealed by the Castigator of the Outer Territories
 as well, Ursempyre Remis, the acting Arch-minister Burge Freis, and that
 buffoon, the Procrastinator Militant, Gomermont.
 That had been enough to bitterly set his mind and order the immediate assembly
 of all fighting units.
 Once General Tyrpledge reaffirmed his army's oaths to Castigator Olorius
 Menamon, he had ordered the army to march toward the City of Pyr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They would march in a campaign to uphold the Law and free their land and
 people from the tyranny of evil men.
 Men whose sinister purposes knew no bounds and would stop at nothing other

 the destruction of their divinely crafted society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As these announcements had been made in front of the whole army, the few
 procrastinators spread around the staging grounds having received word
 of the General's orders fled with alacrity in an unusual sign of intelligence.

And so it had begun, the campaign that would forever change the history
 of the Outer Territories for better, or for worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The General had been musing on these recent past events for some time it
 seemed, because he could hear anxiety and worry in the words that his adjutant
 repeated in the same staccato manner:

 If possible, I would like to keep bloodshed to a minimum.
 The insurgents could be hiding anywhere, posing as innocents and sheltered
 by anonymity.
 Unless they put a jester's hat on with bell's and whistles, our soldiers
 will be unable to differentiate between the enemy and the common folk.
 Though the distinction by the time all this is over could become a lesson
 in semantics.
 Carry on, major.

Major Guighan saluted briskly and rejoined the guards further back, where
 he relayed the order to continue.
 With that they set off, the horses picking up the pace of a slow trot,
 and the foot-soldiers following briskly behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
For the most part, the insurgents seemed ready to hold their ground and
 the walls looked well defended, with no exceptionally weak points in sight.
 No significant breach had been made from the first shots of the siege engines,
 and the rest of them had barely began to be assembled at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Once these were completed and a point of entry selected, they would fire
 a barrage concentrated on a specific point in the walls, hoping to tear
 it down and gain entry.
 His cavalry had made attempts at reconnoitering but had not succeeded in
 gaining much other than some fatal injuries and lots of worn out horses.
 It seemed that the men defending the walls would not be caught napping
 so easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The General from this distance could see the milling masses of men, assembling
 to receive their orders for the day, cleaning their swords and tending
 to their armor and shields.
 He could see the pike-men polishing their halberds in an almost ceremonious
 fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The bowmen were stretching the chords of their bows, testing their tension
 limits and filling their quivers with arrows.
 The swordsmen were up and about ready to be called into action, their longsword
s a mirror sheen, their chain-mails and helmets a steely dull gray.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The General was pleased with what he was seeing; the men were following
 orders, adhering to protocol, and going about their business as usual.
 As if this was one of many exercises, as if they were not marching for
 war against their own people.
 In a rare moment in his career, the General did not know what to make of
 that.
 Did his men care not at all? Or was their sense of duty overshadowing their
 other emotions? That remained to be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The outlook of his army, he deemed, was a professional and determined force
 ready for action.
 But some of the units though required special attention, because of their
 special nature and their special abilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The men of the vaunted Thorax regiment were still trying to put on their
 monstrously over-sized armor; they were huge burly men encased in thick
 sheets of plate metal, almost impervious to arms, even against steam rifles.
 They would form the front line of the assault, to cover and shield the
 men behind them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And far behind, at their maximum range, while all the rest of the army was
 preparing for battle, the crews of the steamers were making sure their
 machines would be ready when called upon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Everything seemed as it should be; everyone seemed professional, going about
 their work.
 It somehow felt wrong for an army to be this distant, so indifferent to
 an enemy that was in fact their own people, though wildly misled and utterly
 wrong in their decision to upset their way of life with shattering consequences.
 Or so Tyrpledge felt.
 He didn't know and could not know though, what his men thought and felt.
 He'd have to wait for them to show their true demeanor and spirit in the
 ultimate test: battle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When battle would be joined, the true feeling of his men would emerge.
 Beyond wrath and blood lust, beyond the will to survive and in doing so
 kill a man, would they show remorse? Guilt? Would they stay their hands
 in a moment of doubt? When they would see their own brother coming at them
 with ax and sword, would they judge him wrongly, the animal inside having
 the final word? When all this is said and done, will there be victory?
 Or nothing but loss? It would be for the Gods to decide.
 Himself, as General of the Army of the Outer Territories, he decided he
 would follow his own path to the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His look was now veritably sullen, withdrawn.
 He had reined his horse to stop its trot.
 He was not even looking at the walls now or his men, or any of the machines.
 He was looking at his own hands with the gloves taken off, fearing that
 somehow blood had already soiled them.
 The blood of his own people.
 But their lives were forfeit now, he knew, the very moment they decided
 to carry out every unholy blasphemous act ever imagined.
 What did they hope to gain, other than seed war, bloodletting, misery,
 and hate? He could not fathom.
 He could never remit their folly now.
 They may have dug their own graves, but the thought that he would have
 to fill them saddened him immensely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He looked up again, squinting slightly at the bright light of the suns.
 He noticed from the corner of his eye Major Guighan approaching almost
 sheepishly, a trait that usually provoked his anger and irritation even
 though he did not consider himself an irascible man.
 It was probably because he expected men around him to perform their duties
 to the best of their abilities.
 Major Guighan was his adjutant so he was supposed to stay close to him,
 advise him, and confide in him.
 How could he do that from all that distance? He was an exceptional logistics
 officer, very capable at handling personnel and men via manifests and report
 forms, but his communication skills were somewhat sub-par.
 Perhaps the Major was for some reason intimidated by the General or his
 rank and office, but that would not do for the position he currently held,
 in the General's opinion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When the Major approached him at a respectful distance as if the General
 emitted some kind of aura he did not wish to step on, he saluted crisply
 and asked him in a most professional, clipped tone of voice:
\end_layout

Sir.
 You seem to have stopped here for no apparent reason.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Tyrpledge turned and stabbed the man with his eyes, his face a mixed expression
 of exasperation and wild disbelief.
 The General was thinking he would give the Major one last chance before
 he placed him at the front of a Thorax battalion, with no armor whatsoever.
 With evident effort to restrain himself he replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Should I require a physician, Major, I will ask for one myself.
 Unless of course I'm bleeding to death.
 But that's the reason you are my adjutant, it seems.
 You always remind me blissfully that I am not bleeding to death.
 You accomplish that with your hollow remarks and repetitively inane questions.
 I will ask you just this once Major, to act accordingly and spare me the
 dung.
 If there is something of import to be said, say it.
 If you think a question in matters of tactics and strategy is pertinent,
 ask.
 You've proved to be an efficient man.
 Now, please prove to me you are an efficient soldier as well.
 There will be death around here by nightfall.
 Don't ever ask me again if I'm feeling ill.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Major Guighan stood stock still as the General's incisive remarks made their
 way to his heart and mind.
 Before the General could turn his gaze elsewhere, the Major managed to
 speak:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will not, sir.
 I realize now I had been wrong to assume you were a cold hearted bastard,
 sir.
 I could not bring myself to speak openly to a man who seemed not to care.
 I know differently now.
 With that being said, I believe we have made an extensive examination of
 the walls and no notable weaknesses have been spotted.
 The patrols will try again at nighttime, though we are not expecting any
 hopeful results.
 The men seem to be ready as they'll ever be for such a fight.
 Should we return to the staff tent and plan our tactical approach on the
 matter?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Tyrpledge was stunned to hear the man speak his mind after all this time.
 He believed no one had called him like that since he had become the General,
 and he also felt kind of hurt that a member of his staff would think him
 so.
 It actually meant then that the others thought so as well.
 He guessed the Major would make amends though.
 After a somewhat awkward moment of silence, Tyrpledge replied:

Ursempyre was fretfully looking over the tall arched balcony of the Disciplinari
um's east tower.
 His gaze was deeply woven with sorrow and hurt.
 His soul felt empty and broken.
 Whatever he had been planning, was now nothing but a dream.
 The gale of the wind brought to his nostrils the smell of ash and cinder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Fires had started in some parts of Pyr.
 Fires from the siege engines of the Army.
 Tyrpledge was leading them, a good man as far as he could remember, as
 far as he could judge a man.
 He believed he no longer had that privilege.
 Who was he to judge others? A consummate traitor, by any account.
 He was bereft of the things he valued most: Truth, honor, friendship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had lied, and he had deceived.
 He had lost his honor and sworn oaths that had filled his mouth with venom
 and choler.
 He had sacrificed everything, to save something.
 And now this.
 Within a single night he had been duped not once, but twice.
 He had been played like a puppet, and now his people would pay the price.
 All of his people, not just the kinsfolk, not only those that were prepared
 to pay some price.
 Everyone would now pay for his failure, his lack of wisdom and foresight.
 He had been arrogant, he could see that now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had believed himself capable of achieving the dream of countless generations,
 becoming the leader behind which the kinsfolk would spread like wildfire,
 uniting the people against a tyranny as old as stone and earth.
 He believed he could have liberated them all and usher a new era where
 every breath would smell of freedom instead of fear and oppression.
 He loathed him! That was what had blinded him.
 Loathing, unquenched passion and blinding wrath.
 The Patriarch was more than merely shrewd; he was a demon incarnate, laughing
 behind their backs, toying with their minds and souls.
 Every single thread of fate firmly in his hands like reins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Only last night, he had thought that the worst fate could have in store
 for him was horrible and meaningless torture at the hands of the Patriarch.
 Now, he was in living hell unable to even scream in agony.
 There was no point, none would listen to him now.
 He had been crushed, mind and spirit, in one blow.
 He had been quite effectively made redundant, irrelevant, obsolete.
 He should not have given the Patriarch's offer any thought.
 He should have denied him.
 Denied his immense powers, his demonic shell and form.
 He should have told him that his people were not afraid of death.
 That it did not matter to him if they perished in eldritch hellish flames,
 or bled their lives away one by one by sword and bow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But that would have been a lie, and the Patriarch would have seen through
 it.
 There was no hope all along, Ursempyre thought.
 As fate had brought things together, and life had shaped him into the man
 he was, there was indeed nothing that could be done.
 He had lost this fight before it had even began.
 He could now do nothing but watch idly from afar, hoping his people would
 survive, that they would endure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
What would become of them then though? What had his mind devised? What end
 did the extravagant machinations serve.
 What reason lay behind this endless pulling of strings and turning of dials
 like the movement of wheels within wheels.
 They left them with a dizzying sensation meant to disorient and mesmerize,
 while right behind the shadows the real stage was being set, Lord Remis
 thought in silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Patriarch's purpose might have been unfathomable, but Ursempyre was
 only certain that it held nothing good in stock for the people.
 If there was one thing he might try as a last attempt at redemption, was
 to try and learn as much as possible from him.
 He somehow felt that was as if trying to squeeze water out of stone, an
 impossible task either way one might look at it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Sooner or later Ursempyre thought, the army would find a way into the city.
 They had the men, the equipment, and the time to do so.
 And then the procrastinators would perhaps find a deserving end unable
 to put up a fight; under-equipped and overwhelmed by numbers they would
 lose the fight for Pyr.
 Even though the total strength of the procrastinators had been summoned,
 it would take days, perhaps weeks for them to arrive in time to stem the
 tide of Tyrpledge's men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ursempyre tried to imagine what must be going through the General's mind
 at such a time.
 Was he torn between his devotion to duty and his feelings for his fellow
 men? Or did he relish the prospect of exacting vengeance in the name of
 the rightful Castigator and the Pantheon? What lay in his heart? Was it
 furious anger? Was it righteous wrath? Blind dedication and dispassionate
 will, the markings of a professional soldier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He rather hoped the General was dumbfounded, left vacant inside at the realizati
on of this horror.
 Perhaps he regarded all this with deep-seated consternation, and was troubled
 at his every step haunted by images of the monstrous consequences his actions
 would have for all of them.
 Was he such a man? He could not know and was deadly afraid that he would
 not like that question to be answered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Lord Remis was standing in front of a stone arch, the weight of his body
 supported by his hands touching the granite as if they had been attached
 to it for ages.
 Servants had offered to bring him food and water.
 He had waved them away, but he could hear the frailness of their voices,
 their disbelief and fear.
 He did not know what it was that they feared most: the coming battle, the
 Patriarch, or the sudden realization that the world had come upside down
 in a single night?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His guards outside the chamber had seemed equally perturbed.
 Though hand-selected from the ranks of the procrastinators, they were not
 as blind and unintelligent as their lesser comrades.
 He had seen the complexion on their faces turn into the color of ash, blood
 pumped away from their hearts lest it explode in shock when they saw him
 appointed Castigator, in the stark middle of the night with only the Patriarch
 and a few Disciplinarium officials to attend as witnesses.
 It all seemed wrong, even to simpletons such as these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He did not question for one second though that should he try to act wildly,
 fear would overcome them and their instincts would not be reined; they
 would bring him down, as the Patriarch had ordered them to, `for his own
 good'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
On recollection it seemed to Ursempyre that the Patriarch was somehow swinging
 this whole affair, precariously navigating between duplicity and lawfulness,
 trying to rewrite the Law and everything it had stood for since the very
 founding of the Territories.
 It was as if he had no clear view of the future he wanted to create for
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
If, indeed, the Patriarch had been planning for any future at all.
 Ursempyre thought such a being incapable of planning anything else than
 their complete extermination.
 The total annihilation of the Outer Territories starting from Pyr, the
 seat of power and Law.
 That would not be beyond a hateful being of such power, malevolence, and
 intelligence.
 The only thing that such a path would lack, would be reason.
 But then again, Ursempyre thought as he smiled bitterly and shook his head,
 who said reason had any part in all this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ursempyre could see now the smoke from the fires rising, procrastinators
 running in the streets, forcing people to follow them and press-ganging
 them to be used as firemen, workers, craftsmen, and ultimately, fodder.
 The siege engines of the Army were starting their baleful song again, the
 thudding and creaking of huge catapults and trebuchets launching stone
 and lit barrels of tar against the city, indiscriminately, randomly.
 They were killing the same people they were meant to protect.
 How very much like something the Patriarch would have conjured in his ineffable
 mind and ultimate wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

He sniggered bitterly despite himself.
 Then he heard a sparkling voice and could almost see the insipid smile

Ursempyre turned to face him, his eyes sizzling with hatred.
 He felt like lunging at him and ending this farce before he had to bear
 witness to the atrocities that would stain every street with blood and
 fire.
 But that would be cowardice, another treasonous step towards the hell that
 awaited men like him.
 No, he would try and make something out of this charade he had been forced
 to play in.
 So, he indulged the Patriarch's cruel sociability and answered with a flat,
 stern voice:

 his temper in check, trying to make good use of his aggravation at being

Is that what you are planning? To see all of us men dead and done for? Worm
 food, is that what you think of us? Have you had this idea in your mind
 for long, or is it a newly hatched fantasy of yours? What kind of cruel
 nature gave life to the likes of a creature like you, I cannot fathom.
 I only wish there are no others of your kind roaming free in this world.

The Patriarch was looking at an exquisitely fashioned silver egg encrusted
 with gems.
 He looked as if he genuinely could not decide whether it was purely ornamental
 or served some functional purpose as well.
 He replied to Ursempyre with a nonchalant voice:

Oh, no there are not.

 But that is another story.
 You should not need to worry, I am not planning on telling you about it.
 At least not now.
 Perhaps, later.
 It will depend.
 I am a very moody person, I don't know if you've noticed it.
 I tend to follow my whims.
 I feel one should follow his heart, don't you?

You mock everything around you with extravagant arrogance and cynical devotion

Careful now, Castigator Ursempyre Remis.
 If you are trying to attract my ire with an amateurish attack on what you
 would call 'pride', you are sorely mistaken and I can only feel genuinely
 sorry for your failure to truly understand.
 Though it would be more than a surprise if you did.
 I simply did not expect you to try and use cheap, underhanded tactics that
 only work with moronic politicians such as yourself.
 Though it seems idiocy is a useful trait in politics.
 It got you to the very top.

The Patriarch summoned a sardonic smile that made Ursempyre feel queasy.
 He was relentlessly carving up his mind and soul to feast on at his leisure.
 His words infuriated him and tore him apart at the same time.
 The Patriarch noticed he was not going to reply and pressed on:

What are you thinking now, Ursempyre? I told you I can't read minds, not

 But I do take delight in toying with you, that much is certain.
 Why, you ask? Should it be beneath me? A being of my powers? You talk as
 if you could understand me fully, as you knew the extend of my abilities.
 You've made the same mistake as the men before you.
 Like Shan, especially like him.
 You think of me driven by the same desires and needs as you.

Do you really think this is about power? The ability to control others?
 That is nothing but a tool to wield.
 Power can be used to transform people, bend them, chastise them, shape
 them.
 Isn't that much more fun than simply using a person? I could talk around
 it for hours Ursempyre, but you would still lack the acuity of spirit to
 grasp the notion in its fullness.
 How could I explain something so simple to a mind as occluded as yours?

Vying for a freedom you would fail to maintain.
 Unable to control yourself in the simplest of urges you would wish you'd

That's what it feels like for me Ursempyre, a game where I can have it all

 I set the scene and act my part, with you as unknown partners.
 What makes it so grandiose Lord Remis, is the fact that for the most part,
 you are willing partners.
 None of this foolishness you dream of, simple lust.
 Passion.
 Life exploding from every inch of your pathetic existence in contrast to
 your inane mewling.

 If you could ever aspire to something Ursempyre, it would be to a perception

 You would not weep then; indeed the idea would bring tears of laughter

 You would see the true nature of things.
 Despair now, for you very well know you have nothing else left to do in

He felt inundated with anger and sorrow; he wanted to vent, spill this rueful
 cup of emotions he carried.
 He could not find the strength to do so.

 them and their tyranny.

He had not foreseen it had all stemmed from this man.
 That was his biggest failing, the breaking point when he had been canceled;
 when he had been turned into a shadow, a creeping thing that should cease

 He felt like his very being was an affront to man.
 His dark thoughts had swallowed Ursempyre whole, and he lay there on the
 floor of his chambers upon a carpet with the embroidery of the Castigator,
 weeping for himself, mourning for the future that would not come, his people
 that would cease to be.

He had helped in that crime, he saw it again more fully now; he had been

 He was a lesser man, he knew then.
 There would be no turning back, for no one.
 Parts of his mind urged him to endure but his soul was crushed, the spirit
 gone.
 The Patriarch was right all along; he would despair, because nothing else
 was left for him to do.

Ikebod leaned his head carefully out of the corner of the street, and looked
 up the street to his right.
 Once he was assured it was safe, he made a gesture behind him.
 Celia and two trusted guards from House Remis came to his side.
 The guards wore nondescript armor and clothing: plain, unadorned and utilitaria
n.
 Their faces wore stern expressions, exuding an air of determination and
 professionalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Celia looked wary but she felt confident of her guides.
 She thought Ikebod would even give his life to protect her, if it ever
 came to that.
 Something that was more than a mere thought with the City burning under
 siege.
 The smoke from the various small fires hung thick in the air, the light
 breeze blowing through the city of Pyr unable to clear the atmosphere.
 The rosy red of the coming dusk was mingled with the sooty gray of the
 smoke, turning the air into a dark crimson red, gloomy and menacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

They hurried across the street where the shadows would offer them some degree
 of protection from ever searching eyes.
 Word around the kinsfolk was that the procrastinators had begun press-ganging
 people in the streets, eagerly searching for any poor soul that happened
 to wander.
 Houses were being invaded and the men forcibly taken away from their families.
 It seemed that it had all begun quite the other way around from what had
 been planned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Instead of leading the revolution, Lord Ursempyre Remis had suddenly sided
 with the Patriarch.
 It was more than a bitter blow to the Kin.
 It was an unimaginable, completely unthinkable event, that nevertheless
 had come to pass just the night before.
 From what Celia could gather from the dealings of Ikebod with various people
 from the kinsfolk while they still remained at House Remis, they were not
 safe in the estate.
\end_layout

They had to flee, and disperse.
 The various cells, the people in the organization delegated with some degree
 of organizational responsibility would convene somewhere else, in one of
 the places prepared elsewhere according to a carefully laid out contingency

 No one had thought though that Lord Remis would be absent, indeed turn
 traitor.

She had not known the man personally, but from the people around him, she
 could not understand such a thing.
 Amonas was one such man, and he could never turn traitor; his heart and
 mind was, she intimately knew, utterly devoted to their cause.
 He had dreamt of a better future, and he had shared that vision with her.
 They were planning to raise their child in a bright, hopeful tomorrow.
 What would become of that vision now that everything seemed to crumble
 like a wall of dried mud around her? She felt the child kick with vigor,
 blissfully unaware of what was transpiring in the world it would be born
 in soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were walking briskly, anxiously throwing gazes all around them, wary
 of being seen.
 Ikebod was leading them through the streets instead of the underground
 passages because he was afraid they might have been compromised.
 If procrastinators were indeed running around the underground passages
 looking for kinsfolk, they would be caught like mice with nowhere to run.
 While running on the streets presented a more obvious danger, it also offered
 them more venues of escape.
 It was a gambit they hoped would not fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They could hear the distant cries of procrastinators and the thuds of impacts
 from the siege engines.
 The army was methodical in its approach, wearing down the defenders of
 the city, forcing them to occupy themselves with the spreading fires that
 threatened to engulf them in a firestorm that would burn the city of Pyr
 to the ground, along with most of its populace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When the opportune time arrived, they would then probably try to breach
 the walls in their weakest point, or storm them en masse, whichever would
 seem to offer the best chances of entering the city.
 As things stood, it was a matter of time.
 The most pressing issue though was what the kinsfolk would do in this mayhem.
 Would they try and rescue the city and its people from certain destruction?
 Or should they try and flee? Ikebod had seemed reticent to disclose any
 more of his thoughts on the matter, but he seemed to have his mind occupied
 with many other unvoiced concerns.
 Celia hoped he could also propose some solution, some idea that would bring
 hope instead of the gloomy despair and doubt that seemed to hang in the
 air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had reached another crossroads now and they were about to emerge in
 a brightly lit wide road.
 They were hiding in a dark alleyway, the light from the street casting
 flickering shadows on the walls around them.
 Ikebod and one of the guards peered over the street.
 Ikebod motioned the guard to hide again.
 He seemed agitated when he said:

Procrastinators.

The guards nodded in acknowledgement and turned around to go back the way

 Ikebod gently pushed Celia to follow them with him right behind her.
 Suddenly, the guards in front of them froze, and drew their swords.
 A patrol of procrastinators had seen them, and they yelled:

 One of the guards turned around to Celia and Ikebod and told them in a
 quiet, determined way:

Ikebod nodded crisply and took Celia by the arm.
 She turned around and opened her mouth to protest, but soon her feet were
 galloping in the pace Ikebod set.
 His pull became stronger as she seemed to hesitate but she yielded, her
 instincts driving her body rather than her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They crossed the wide street without caring whether they or not they would
 be seen.
 It no longer mattered.
 They would now have to make haste, they had been seen.
 As they ran down the streets of Pyr passing through small alleys and brightly
 lit roads, they realized night had come and the buildings and houses around
 them were lit by firelight.
 Pyr was burning.
 Celia felt a sudden pang of fear grip her heart and instinctively tightened
 her grasp on Ikebod's arm.
 The wizened, trusted servant of House Remis told her soothingly as they
 ran together:

 Ikebod was also straining himself, though she believed he was leading them

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They heard confounded voices shouting directions.
 Other procrastinators must have been alarmed of their presence.
 They could hear the galloping of horses on the cobbled streets around them.
 It felt like an invisible noose was tightening around them and was about
 to close tight too soon for comfort.

He freed himself from her grip and started heading the way they came.
 She stood there transfixed for a moment, and then thought of her child

 She believed she would feel torn inside, but the decision came instinctively.
 She ran with all the alacrity she could muster, holding her abdomen with
 care while she tried to follow Ikebod's directions to the letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She felt like crying, but the tension prevented her from doing so.
 She really hoped Ikebod would somehow make it alive out of this ordeal,
 but she did not really expect him to do so.
 She wasn't even sure about herself and her child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She turned to the street Ikebod had told her and saw the blacksmith's shop,
 derelict and shabby from the outside.
 Wooden planks barely concealed its broken windows and a shrank, worn-out
 wooden door that seemed only half-closed.
 A rusty chain and a lock that seemed to be purely decorative in its purpose
 held the door from falling down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She thought she heard then the pained cry of Ikebod from afar, echoing over
 the stones of the streets.
 She did not stop or look behind, she knew there was no point.
 She was in the dark alley looking at a rather sturdy-looking door.
 She knocked thrice and after a brief pause of silence, a reply sounded
 in the form of two knocks.
 She hesitated for a second and then knocked only once.
 Another small silence followed and the door opened, barely a fist wide.

Celia was surprised and instinctively took a step back.
 She searched her mind for a moment, and could not recall Ikebod telling

 She was worried she might have misheard or in the panic of the moment forgotten

 Without anything else to reply, she simply told the man what she could:

She nodded and went down the small flight of steps hearing the hatch close
 behind her.
 She was standing in a corridor carved in rock, with lit torches affording
 the place barely enough light for someone to walk without running onto
 a wall.
 In the distance she could only see darkness, but she thought she could
 hear a din of sorts like men talking, some of the voices louder than the
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She walked with an almost wary pace, not knowing where the corridor led.
 She felt unsure now, vulnerable.
 She thought of Ikebod and renewed her trust in him and his words.
 She should be safe here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As she walked towards the dark end of the corridor, she could see light
 pouring in from one side.
 The din grew louder, and the sound of quarreling voices became evident.
 She felt pain in her lower abdomen, and flinched.
 With every step she took, the voices grew clearer.
 She could now hear men having a very loud argument, many people trying
 to speak all at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She reached the end of the corridor and stepped through a narrow opening
 into a wide, much more brightly lit cave that seemed large enough for hundreds
 of people.
 Large stalactites hung from the ceiling, mirrored in some places by their
 corresponding stalagmites.
 Some stalagmites seemed cut by man and others had joined with the stalactites
 forming columns; some were thin and others thick as pillars.
 The bright light was coming from numerous torches and braziers, casting
 enormous shadows on the walls of the cave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She could see more than a hundred men standing with maybe a dozen of them
 to a separate side from the others, forming somewhat of a circle around
 a brazier that seemed to stand squarely in the middle of the cave.
 They were shouting at each other and she could not make out a single phrase.
 It was as if the market of Pyr had secretly gathered in here, each man
 trying to sell his wares to no avail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She took a few more steps closer and she felt pain in her lower abdomen
 again, this time more acute.
 She let out a single cry as the pain came to her with a stabbing sensation
 and made her gasp.
 A couple of men that were standing closer to her almost isolated from the
 throng of people, must have heard her and turned to look.
 They were surprised and quickly strode to her side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They seemed wary, even suspicious of her.
 As she stood there with an expression of pain still written on her features,
 one of the men grabbed her gently by the arm, noticing she was carrying.
 She asked her then while the other man was overlooking and the cacophony
 behind them continued unabated:

The pain welling up from inside her numbed her senses; she gasped and struggled

 The man who hadn't yet spoken asked her:

He saw the place they were in: It was a small nondescript room with walls
 colored in greenish hues all around.
 It was hexagonal in shape and the relatively high ceiling was etched in

 There was no obvious source of lighting, nothing in the way of a lamp or
 a torch.
 It was as if faint light somehow seeped through the walls and the floor,
 as if starlight somehow crept inside this strange chamber.
 Amonas was lying right beside him unconscious or perhaps sleeping.
 They were both sitting on what seemed to be a circular dais with a glassy
 surface made from a material that only cast the tiniest of reflections
 and seemed to absorb what little light there was in an uncanny manner.

Hilderich felt refreshed and invigorated.
 He stood up to gaze around the chamber.
 He was curious of their new surroundings and believed that they had probably
 arrived at what that voice had called the centron.
 It was quite a long stretch taking the words of a disembodied voice seriously,
 but he felt he should put some trust in something that could mend his body
 without pain so easily in what seemed to have been mere minutes.
 What really mattered right now to Hilderich though was that they were off
 that accursed place that came close to claiming his life.
 They were not quite where they were hoping to be, but they were well on
 their way it seemed; that felt like a truly blissful achievement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The room was otherwise uninteresting; it sported a single door barely recognizab
le by its very thin frame, probably made of the same material as the walls.
 As he was searching the room for anything that might pique his interest,
 he heard Amonas beside him grunt and moan slightly.
 He turned around to look at him and smiled brightly:

 Well, many theories, but I was not privy to the bulk of his work.
 I was supposed to find this man that held all the answers I could ever

I knew Cimon was working on something concerning the keystones for a long

Please, hear me out.
 I believe this person, the Stoneforger, is not a myth, and if there's one

 I believe that the voice that spoke to us and tended to my wounds is indeed
 what it claimed to be; from what I could gather, an ancient technological
 marvel.
 Do not easily ascribe such wonders to things as magic and Gods, Amonas.
 You were right to believe our world is built upon heaps of lies and deceit.
 I do not know what you saw when you stepped into that pillar of light the
 first time, but this time that pillar of light brought us here.
 I believe all the evidence you will ever need to show me is right here
 in this place, the centron.

There is vast knowledge and certainly intelligence of some sort at work
 here, Amonas.
 It must be this man, this person I'm seeking.
 Though my reasoning is that he is so much more than a simple man.
 But he exists.
 He should exist.
 Everything points to that logical assumption.
 My master had devoted most of his life searching out for more clues to
 prove the existence of a place very much like what we are standing in now.
 It would cause him to gape in awe and astonishment surely, because he believed
 such a thing could only belong to an era long ago forgotten, to a civilization
 totally extinct.
 He believed that if he would ever find anything, he would find relics,
 artifacts, ruins.
 But as you've seen, there is much more to that.
 Inane artifacts like stone and marble and brick do not speak with disembodied
 voices, Amonas; that much is certain.

Amonas shook his head and replied to Hilderich as he stood up, his gaze
 now bearing tension.
 He still wore a pained expression on his face, only this time it was mingled
 with wariness and suppressed annoyance.
 He believed he was beginning to understand what Hilderich was about to
 propose and he did not relish the thought.
 He asked him tersely:

All I know is that the keystone is what has enabled us to reach this place.
 A keystone that was in the care of my master, who had spent years of his
 life trying to connect the existence of the keystones with other devices,
 and an extinct civilization of extreme sophistication.
 The pillars of light, the pyramids, the keystone, the voice; all we've
 seen so far are indeed proof of the concepts and theories in his studies.

I could never have hoped to happen upon such marvels by mere perseverance,
 Amonas.
 I would have spent my days around arcane texts and chronicles, researches,
 studies and dusty volumes written by men who had lost their minds in the
 process.
 A process that would take me years, perhaps decades to carry through myself;
 analyzing and cross-checking references, names, places, and artifacts.
 It would have claimed the better years of my life.
 And it would have proven a futile endeavor just like the one my master
 had embarked upon.

At the mention of Hilderich's master, Amonas brought to his mind the image
 of Cimon, always a thoughtful person, gentle and kind.
 A good friend with which he had spent many nights discussing the finer
 points of drinking.
 He was soothing for the soul, Cimon.
 And Celia was his offspring; she could not have been without him.
 He owed him so much more than a fleeting memory of a gone friend.
 His face mellowed somewhat, he even felt the headache had subsided as well.
 He asked Hilderich with a calm, friendly voice this time:

Even though he was the first Curator to assemble enough evidence to support
 such a theory, when he presented his work he was met with derision, laughed
 upon as another half-mad fool.
 Sadly, only a few of his friends and colleagues supported him in public
 and pleaded for him to maintain his status as Curator, albeit on the condition
 that he would burn the bulk of his work and renounce it as a work of fiction.
 He had never broached the subject during my apprenticeship.
 I learned about it from my surreptitious ventures into his personal study.
 To tell you the truth, I did not believe him either, and sided silently
 with those who considered him a little less than deranged.
 I was sorely mistaken and the proof came in the worst of ways the day my
 master died.

If it was by fate or chance alone I do not know, it really matters little

 a place where myth meets reality.
 In a sense, stepping through that pillar of light was both a blessing and
 a curse.
 We're here now, Amonas, closer than ever.
 I need to find him.
 Not just for my sake, or my master's sake.
 It would be a revelation that could change the world.

Don't you see? We have to find him first and foremost before we do anything

 Answers to everything you could possibly imagine, Amonas.
 Everything is here.
 Everything began here.
 It must have.
 This is the place of legend man has locked out of his mind, but has kept
 it in his soul.
 A world that is somehow connected to our own.
 A world steeped in technology that is undreamt of.
 The links to a past that we had thought only existed in stories, and tales.
 But it's real enough, Amonas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We have to find him, or his people.
 Their history, their lore.
 We must have access to it so we can learn of our own past.
 Don't you see? We walk into a pillar of light and then end up in another

 Going back and finding the Stoneforger, those two quests have become irrevocabl

They were now walking through a stupendous underground cavern of exquisite
 beauty.
 Huge crystals of many colors and large clear-cut facets hung from the ceiling,
 mirroring their walking figures with pristine clarity, sparkling from the
 faint light that filled the vast space with remarkable ease.
 Some of their reflections were large enough to see clearly, even though
 the roof of this gigantic enclosure was improbably high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Simply looking at it filled them with awe but disoriented them as well,
 making them feel queasy after a while.
 They had been walking on a narrow gangway that connected two crevices on
 opposite sides of the cavern.
 Far below their feet, furious swirls of white hot and molten red rock churned
 with rage, their incandescent light gracing the thought-defying towers
 that seemed to vanish into the infernal abyss with an eerie glow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The cavern had stunned them with its wild, harsh beauty when they first
 laid their eyes upon it.
 The towers were another unfathomable wonder that imagination would have
 failed to conjure.
 They rose from the depths of the inferno of molten rock and lava up to
 the level of the unique gangway that traversed the astounding cavity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Their surface was matte black, almost obsidian-like.
 It very much seemed to resemble the material the bullhorns were made of,
 but it seemed to lack the same level of refinement.
 It seemed as if it was more coarse in nature, more suited to the harsh
 environment they were set in.
 Indeed their foundations seemed to lie in a hellish sea of fire where nothing
 could ever hope to remain intact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Yet, these towers endured.
 A thin lattice of glass-like pipes connected them, forming a grid.
 Bright white light seemed to flow through them with slow, deliberate pulses.
 A marvel of technology, certainly a feat of engineering only a civilization
 hundreds of thousands of years old could hope to achieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had passed through various corridors along the way, not all of them
 uniform in appearance and size.
 Some were brightly lit, sporting white paneled walls of porcelain-like
 material; others were much more dimly lit, in the fashion of the room they
 had woken up in.
 Some were pitch black, none of their features visible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Most were in pristine condition, like people lived in there and dutifully
 kept it clean and polished, but they had not met a single soul.
 Their senses informed them that this place was void of life, deserted,
 and abandoned.
 No smell or sound gave away the presence of living men.
 But there were no cobwebs, no dust, and no grime to call this place abandoned
 and forlorn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It seemed uncannily void of life, as if everyone around had left in a hurry,
 no detritus of their existence left behind.
 But surely men must have walked past these walls, for though they varied,
 they seemed designed and engineered to accommodate people.
 Men like them; not giants, demons, or Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was a strange mix, this network of corridors and passages.
 As if it had been built by different people at different times, adding,
 removing, restructuring as they saw fit; by whim or necessity, it was impossibl
e to know.
 Hilderich had been filled with enthusiasm at the thought of systematically
 mapping these passages; thousands of questions had formed in his mind seeking
 answers, in-fighting for a quota of attention and musing time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
From the moment they left the chamber where they woke up in, they followed
 an almost random course generally preferring lit paths whenever possible.
 They had ended up in dead-ends, mostly doors that would not open of their
 volition like most of them did.
 They had backtracked and chosen alternate tracks.
 Marking the walls was impossible, as they seemed impervious to Amonas knife,
 unable to even put a slight notch on their surface, irrespective of the
 force exerted and the effort spent.
 Hilderich had been uncannily able to remember where they had passed from
 before, and thus they managed to not get lost in the irregular maze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It had paid out in the end.
 Their path had taken them to the crystal-roofed cavern, with a brightly
 lit gate on the opposite end of the gangway.
 The gangway itself was as nondescript as the walls they had seen so far
 but what had genuinely picked Amonas' interest, apart from the immensity
 of all that surrounded them was that the gangway did not possess any guardrails
, as if it was impossible for someone to trip and hurl himself down to certain
 death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas shared his concern before they had even made the first steps, cautious
 as ever.
 Hilderich briefly pondered such a scenario and with a wild grin on his
 face, before Amonas could react he had tried to simply walk off the gangway
 into the churning lava below.
 He had stopped in mid air with a silver sheen suddenly adorning the wispy
 air around his leg and knee, as if an invisible wall stood on each side
 of the gangway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas had sighed and scolded Hilderich in a fashion that made Hilderich
 laugh with all his heart.
 Amonas did not perceive the whole incident with the same amount of good
 humor and for quite some time he wore an expression of mild exasperation.
 If one did not know better he could have mistaken him as having his feelings
 genuinely hurt because of Hilderich's lack of consideration.
 It was dangerously immature, Amonas thought, for someone to behave so precariou
sly in such a place of unknown dangers and roaming uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich seemed impervious to anything less than the magnificence of the
 wonders, both natural and technological that surrounded them while on that
 gangway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
While they were walking on the gangway with an easy pace, almost casually
 in fact, Hilderich asked Amonas without turning to look behind him:

Amonas did not answer him, and remained silent as ever.
 He was not gazing around him like Hilderich did, woolgathering.
 He seemed preoccupied, lost in wary thoughts about their imminent future.
 He could still remember stepping on that pillar of light, and could certainly
 remember their tribulations in that hot steamy world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But this place, this centron, where was this place if not on that same world?
 Where were they now? Until he would find these answers, his mind would
 not cease to worry.
 He tried to remember more of what the voice had been saying to them, but
 he had been utterly confounded by its meager explanations.
 His mind was still jarred by the headache and though it had subsided considerab
ly, a sting of it still lingered and made his thinking muddied and unclear,
 his most recent memories a blur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It troubled him most that Hilderich's mind seemed to wander freely.
 He had turned from a reserved, cautiously inquisitive young man into an
 enthusiastic juvenile that would not leave a rock unturned until he had
 satisfied his insatiable lust for knowledge.
 Amonas on the other hand felt as if he had been forcibly restrained, not
 free to speak his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had found nothing to drink or eat, and every door that they had been
 able to open lead into what might have been living quarters, or other utility
 rooms.
 Some chambers contained metal crates they could not open and frustration
 had built up inside him.
 Hilderich was so excited with each new little discovery that he seemed
 unperturbed by the fact that like all living things, they needed food and
 water, and they had found naught.
 As if the people that used to live here in ages past conjured their food
 out of thin air.
 To Amonas, this place was even harsher than the lush wilderness they had
 left behind.
 At least there, they could find something to fill their bellies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And what of their vaunted attempts at gaining knowledge, Amonas mused with
 aggravation.
 What had they found out so far that they could use? Almost nothing of import.
 All they knew was that they were somewhere deep underground it seemed,
 and that they had only found out when they ran across the cavern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He sighed and looked at Hilderich in front of him, who seemed to be filled
 with vigor and an enthusiasm he thought to be unbecoming of the situation
 in hand.
 Perhaps he was rushing his judgment on this matter.
 It was in fact an unfortunate series of events that had led them there,
 to a bleak place that seemed to offer little, but they had been there for
 mere hours.
 He supposed it was too early to expect much from their meandering search.
 But soon they would have to worry about sustenance, purely in a practical
 sense.
 Amonas decided to let it be for now, but he felt his unease would only
 grow given time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Soon, they were standing at the end of the gangway with a small plateau
 opening before them.
 There the large gate stood, set against a jutting rock wall that seemed
 to crash upon it like a granite waterfall frozen in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was marveling at the dimensions of the gate.
 It seemed large enough for a siege engine of the army to pass through,
 almost three stories high.
 Hilderich wondered what manner of things, machines and people, had passed
 through these gates.
 It was indeed larger than any other gate he had seen.
 What manner of need had led to it being designed and built to these dimensions?
 Another mystery for him to solve when time allowed it, he thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Amonas spoke then, his voice sounding somewhat distant, as if his mind was
 removed elsewhere and he was merely glimpsing what surrounded him:

Hilderich's face showed his wariness.
 He did not know what to make of Amonas' strange behavior.
 These mood swings and the evident trouble he had concentrating, these were
 things he would have to ask him about soon.
 Preferably when they had something to eat.
 He was indeed beginning to feel famished.
 It was the endless fascination and enthusiasm that kept him going, the
 tension, the thrill.
 He noticed Amonas' was looking at him with an aggravated, expectant look,
 and answered him in an excusatory tone:
\end_layout

Ahm.
 No, though it might come to that.
 Knocking, that is.
 There seem to be no visible controls, which would suggest that this gate

 Or, that it's just another large door that opens up on itself like the
 ones before.
 We'll just have to see now.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas grunted with restrained disapproval and nodded.
 Hilderich had known Amonas to be circumspect at times, taciturn and almost
 spartan with his words, but he had never showed feelings of dislike or
 animosity towards him.
 He was beginning to feel that had somehow changed since they arrived in
 this place, the centron.
 Maybe he was having second thoughts about their change of plans.
 Maybe this place made him uneasy because of its otherworldliness, its antiquity.
 Maybe it was because they were still alone, not a soul in sight.
 With the exception of that weird voice of course, if it indeed had a soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
After his brief inner contemplation, Hilderich stepped on the flattened
 plateau of rock.
 It seemed to be cut cleanly and then carefully smoothed, just short of
 turning its surface slippery.
 He took a few more steps and stood before the gate, gazing at its minimalistic
 features.
 It seemed to be made out of a dull gray, not a single ray of light reflected
 off its surface.
 It almost looked like stone, but it had no pores and no cuts to speak of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich looked at it with one eye.
 Its flat gray surface reminded him of bricks made of argyle and ash.
 The borders of the gate were different, though.
 They were a uniform white material, almost porcelain-like and glossy with
 a smooth reflective quality.
 The two pieces did not seem to fit together at all.
 Hilderich thought there should be some sort of adequate explanation for
 that, but whoever had built this gate did not seem available for answers.
 Hilderich conjured the image of the builder of the gate being asked why
 the colors in his gate seemed all wrong, and the childish thought brought
 a grin to his face.

As much as he looked, Hilderich indeed could not discern any sort of controls,
 levers, ropes, weights, or wheels; nothing a gate could be associated with
 in his experience.
 Then again, it would have been almost ridiculous to expect such crude forms
 of mechanisms in such a place after what they had witnessed.
 But it never hurt to check the obvious things first, so he simply leaned
 against the door, standing smack before the middle of the gate and pushed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Nothing seemed to happen.
 He turned around and looked at Amonas, shrugging.
 His was an apologetic look, and after a while he said to Amonas:

I'm sorry.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich thought Amonas had a very strange expression on his face.
 To him, it looked as if Amonas had felt incredibly stupid somehow, perhaps
 like if he had tried to cut a rope with his knife still sheathed or poured
 himself a glass of wine from an empty bottle and drank it anyway.
 It was the look of a deeply dumbfounded man.
 Hilderich was suddenly worried, believing the man to be sick and in need
 of aid.
 Even though he seemed unable to speak, Amonas managed to point with his
 hand to the gate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich turned around and to his great surprise saw the door had vanished,
 a sight that assaulted his vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was now standing in front of a hall of sorts, only the word `hall' did
 it no justice at all.
 It was a gargantuan circular chamber of immense radius, nothing short of
 a small plain.
 It must have been the area of a small township, complete with the surrounding
 fields.
 It would probably take them hours or the better part of a day to walk across
 it.
 Its dimension in height was almost impossible to measure.
 The walls ran seemingly as high as the sky.
 And there was something about the lighting that seemed recognizable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His feet moved of their own volition then, guiding him to enter this vast
 space proper and see better, even though sight alone was incapable of handling
 such a view.
 Air wafted down upon him, as if from an overhead opening.
 It was dry and chilly, almost cold.
 Instinctively he looked up, expecting to see some sort of mind-boggling
 roof structure, something truly awe-inspiring as the rest of this vast
 enclosed space was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
With a mix of terror, bewilderment, joy and disbelief that contorted his
 face in an almost painful way, what he saw was clear blue sky set between
 the circular edges of the walls, as if looking down a very long pipe.
 The distance was immense, unimaginable.
 Sunlight shafted down in an angled column overhead and its reflections
 on the surface of the walls gave this place this familiar ambient light.
 As he looked up, he saw the bright ring of the sun appearing over the edge
 of the walls.
 In a moment or two, the column of light would fall on him bathing him in
 sunlight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He turned around to Amonas who stood where he was, transfixed.
 He called out to him, gesturing wildly with his hands to come and see for
 himself.
 Amonas shook suddenly, as if waking up from a living nightmare, almost
 trembling.
 He shook his head, and came to Hilderich's side with a brisk pace.
 His gaze wandered around as if this was a strange hall or just another
 chamber, unable to feel mesmerized at the impossibility of the scale surroundin
g them.
 He just said then:

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich spared a moment to look at him sideways.
 The significance of Hilderich's furrowed look was lost to Amonas, who looked
 extravagantly out of place, acting almost nonchalantly, indeed very much
 unlike him.
 Hilderich did not press the matter and instead pointed at the sky, the
 bright rim of the sun glinting at the far edge of the wall.
 He pointed upwards and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas suddenly looked thoughtful, as if contemplating not what Hilderich
 had said but rather as if he was trying to come up with a better word than
 `shaft'.
 Hilderich was about to ask him about this sudden rush of strange behavior
 but then the sun shone upon them momentarily blinding them, causing them
 both to squint and use their hands to block it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In that small sliver of shade that allowed them to peep sheepishly at the
 sun, Hilderich could see its ring grow, the bright sphere grow larger.
 It looked strangely familiar though.
 The sun did not seem to have that blueish hue.
 It looked..
 normal, Hilderich thought.
 And then, he saw a sight that had sorely been missed.
 As the sun grew whole, another ring appeared over the edge of the wall,
 at that other end of this huge shaft.
 A second sun.
 The second sun.
 There were two suns.
 They were home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The realization struck Hilderich like a sledgehammer and he physically reeled
 from the place he stood.
 He was frantic, his gaze switching between Amonas and the sky with cataleptic
 speed.
 He opened his mouth as if to speak but he simply managed to gasp.
 All the while, Amonas was still looking at the suns in a sort of peaceful
 gaze, the falling streaks of sunlight adding a glow to his face that made
 him look more splendid and grandiose than ever despite his disheveled look
 and ragged appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich then shouted with glee:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas turned to look at him slowly, almost indifferently, as if Hilderich
 had barely nudged him and asked for directions in the street.
 It was beginning to feel eerie to Hilderich, this behavior that was very
 much unlike Amonas.
 He looked as if he were someone lost.
 They were home, Hilderich thought, and he was simply standing there looking
 back at him as if he had nothing better to do.
 Hilderich grabbed him by the arm and shook his entire body, as Amonas offered
 little resistance.
 He looked him in the eye with an accusing stare and shouted in his face:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas looked at Hilderich almost impassively with a look as if behind a
 fog, his mind seemingly wandering off to places without any connection
 to reality.
 It was as if he was in a dream haze, unable to wake up from the slumber
 of a mystic.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Amonas did not even flinch.
 He had actually remained quite motionless, his hands limp on his side and
 his face stuck in a slight grin, as if constantly mocking someone.
 This could not be good, Hilderich thought.
 He shook him with both arms, trying to snap him out of whatever had enthralled
 him so.
 He shouted, cursed, he even slapped him twice.
 But it was all to no avail.
 It was as if the man's mind was gone.
 As if he was not there at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich realized with horror the truth of it.
 For some inexplicable reason, Amonas seemed to have lost his mind.
 It was there, carved upon his face.
 A glazed look, a deep blur set in at the center of his eyes, unmoving.
 His face had started to lose its color, and his mouth seemed locked in
 a half-smile.
 It was the face of an idiot unaware of everything going around him, lost
 in a sea of reality's debris none could hope to help him navigate.
 It was heart wrecking to see a man's mind lost in moments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Had it been the simply immeasurable vastness of the vista around them, this
 huge shaft that no mind could lay claim to even imagining it? Was it the
 sudden realization of having returned home in a most inexplicable, wondrous,
 and even uncanny fashion? Was it the combination of both? What had weakened
 his strong, determined mind? What had broken a man who was ready to give
 up his life for his unborn child, for a different, if not a better future?
 Hilderich could not tell, and only thought that it was an ineffable loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had seen marvels none had ever dreamt before and had taken most of
 them in their stride, their sanity intact.
 It was almost a laughable joke to think that Amonas would lose his mind
 at that moment, after all they had seen.
 And yet here he was, a little more than a breathing mass, completely disassocia
ted with his surroundings.
 It sank his spirits right when they should be laughing with all their heart,
 crying with joy from the release of the tension from so many days of hardship
 and uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich for a moment thought that it might have been better if Amonas
 had died somewhere along the way.
 He would have at least had his body and mind as one, his soul intact.
 Now, he looked as if his soul had departed and left an empty mind to rule
 over a hapless body.
 It brought tears to Hilderich's eyes.
 But he held them in check.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had been mended before, when the voice spoke to them.
 There was proof that the ailing of the body could be treated with unsurpassed
 excellence by something or someone that seemed to dwell around here.
 That could also stand true for a sickness of the mind.
 For what was madness, catatonia, or whatever else that had befallen Amonas,
 other than a sickness of the mind? For every sickness there should be a
 cure Hilderich thought, and his face brightened up a little, hope returning
 to his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It seemed that their quest kept redefining itself.
 Now, he owed it to Amonas to make him whole again.
 And he should better get an early start.
 That meant he had to focus his mind, accept some harsh facts, and make
 decisions that would lead them out of this very unfortunate situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He took Amonas by the arm like he would have done with a small child, carefully
 and softly.
 He did not seem to respond in any way, his posture unchanging and his gaze
 fixed to a point beyond his sight.
 Hilderich tried to pull him by the hand and with a slight lurch and a small
 misstep, he began to walk behind him, as if he were a blind man being led
 around by a trusted friend.
 Half that much, Hilderich thought, was true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He could be moved around then, Hilderich thought bitterly, albeit as if
 he were indeed an invalid.
 It all felt wrong to him.
 Seeing Amonas in such a state was almost devastating.
 If such a man could be brought so low without warning, whatever else could
 happen to lesser men, Hilderich thought.
 He hoped Amonas' mind was so far gone that he at least did not perceive
 himself through Hilderich's eyes or had any sort of knowledge or awareness
 of what had befallen him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
If that was the case, Hilderich doubted Amonas could ever return to his
 normal self again; a tragically traumatic experience such as this one would
 be enough to break him by merely remembering.
 He thought Amonas was a stronger man in every aspect that really mattered.
 If he was subject to such a downfall, then why not himself? For the first
 time in the past few days, real fear gripped him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Not anxiety, not worry or wariness but simple primal fear.
 The piercing fear of someone's shadow behind your back.
 The fear of a man's knife, a howl into the night; fear of thunder and lightning.
 Pure, instinctive fear.
 He was alone, by himself.
 If he had been alone on that pyramid, if he had made it that far, he would
 have died with broken ribs sun-burnt to death before anything else, if
 it wasn't for Amonas.
 And now, he had to repay that life debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The suns were now shedding their light higher on the walls of the shaft,
 their bright spheres gone from Hilderich's sight.
 He had to address an issue that seemed to lack an easy solution.
 Where could one find food and water in this immensely vast space? He looked
 around him at the landscape stretching out in front of him.
 The floor was blue-gray and metallic.
 Various thin lines seemed to criss-cross it, as if forming a pattern.
 In fact he noticed that despite the immensity and the curved geometry of
 the walls, he could make out some shapes on the floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He let go of Amonas' arm for a while, and with a certain degree of trepidation
 made a few steps forward in order to examine such a curiosity.
 A relatively thick band of blue light seemed to seep through the floor.
 It went on and on around the whole shaft in a very large blue circle.
 Giving little thought to the matter he stepped on it, and momentarily nothing
 seemed to happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But then he felt a brush of air on the back of his neck, and turned around
 to see that the gate had been shut again.
 Not only that, but only a few feet in front of him the floor started to
 ripple with intensity, turning into a molten pool of what looked like quicksilv
er or mercury.
 Light flickering off it with intensity, Hilderich's figure grotesquely
 reflected in a constantly shifting mirror surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He stepped back instinctively, fear gripping him, the fear of losing his
 mind like poor Amonas had.
 The pool of molten metal rose like a geyser of sorts, bulbous shapes forming
 over its surface.
 It grew as if a column of mud had been raised from the floor, only it was
 silver and mirror-like.
 Then it suddenly took form in mere moments, each step distinct but inhumanly
 quick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich could make out now the forming of metal upon metal, the joints
 between what looked to be plates.
 Whatever this thing was, it's form seemed to derive little inspiration
 from the human body.
 It was shaping itself into something oblong, almost like an egg.
 In its final steps of transformation from a pool of metal into a much more
 tangible existence, it seemed as if an inner blue light faintly lit its
 top and bottom parts, a thin band of what seemed to be black opaque glass
 running through it from top to bottom, as if it was made of two halves
 joined by that very glass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once it was finally formed it hovered in the air right in front of Hilderich,
 barely touching the ground.
 The whole process had taken less than it would take a man to draw his sword
 in a misunderstood attempt at would probably have been futile defense.
 Something that could appear out of a metal floor in such a place in such
 an astounding way, did not leave the impression it could be killed with
 a mere sword.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And then a terrifying sound assaulted Hilderich's senses, a terrible high-pitche
d screech that boomed and echoed like the primordial lightning storm that
 bore the universe and all of creation:

Hilderich tried to put his hands to his ears but he was frozen half-way
 when the world-shattering cacophony ended abruptly and was replaced by
 a buffeting silence, his ears still buzzing from the loudness.
 Then the metal egg or machine, whatever it was, bobbed slightly as if trying
 to mimic a human's bow.
 It spoke in a pleasantly toned voice, that seemed to be gibberish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich's brow furrowed and though his fear had somehow subsided, he was
 feeling terminally uneasy.
 Amonas was standing behind him, slack like before, the signs of a slight
 drool beginning to show on the corner of his mouth.
 Hilderich looked with puzzlement at this construct, and could find nothing
 to say.
 It seemed to be unable to communicate with him.
 After a brief pause, the machine started spewing forth an uninterrupted
 series of sounds that could have been words in rapid succession, as if
 it was searching for a certain word, a certain sound, and was trying them
 all.
 Hilderich couldn't be sure but he thought that perhaps it was trying to
 communicate.
 At length he decided to try and say something.
 He thought the most apt thing to do, was greet it.
 And so he did, with some hesitation and a slight feeling of fear that he
 might be making a fool of himself to an invisible audience:

The construct bobbed again and wiggled its large round base a little.

 so he didn't give it a second thought and smiled.
 He looked somewhat restrained, but genuinely polite.

In only a few moments in a fashion similar to the one before, the avatar
 turned from an egg into a multi-wheeled vehicle with a single seat, and
 what seemed to be a stretcher at the back.
 There appeared to be no controls.
 There was a sort of tent or awning as well, perhaps in order to offer some
 short of shade from the sunlight, but Hilderich thought it was quite superfluou
s.
 Though transforming at will to any shape imaginable was certainly an ability
 that shunted necessities and favored whim and fancy above all.
 Perhaps he could ask more about it later.
\end_layout

The vehicle went to the side of Amonas, and gently carried him off his feet
 and onto the stretcher, all the while maintaining his posture.
 Even if he hadn't lost his mind and knew where he was standing at, Amonas
 would not have been troubled the least.
 Once he was laid down on the stretcher, the vehicle-avatar spoke to Hilderich:

 There was no other uncomfortable sensation, like the forceful rush of air

 speed and that was only if one took very careful notice of the shaft above.

And the God visited upon the land he alone had wrought amidst the firmament
 of the stars.
 For a while he was content to live among His people and teach them all
 that he saw fit in his infinite wisdom.
 One day they built the Forge of Stones, and offered it to God as a gift,
 a sign of their devotion.
 God was saddened and His people asked him why that was; He answered that
 they had need of him no more.
 And then God sailed on a ship of no sails, and left behind His people that
 called him Father.

 break of dawn would be upon them soon.
 Violet ribbons of morning light dressed the cloudless sky with its desert
 clothes.
 The Pilgrim was kneeling, praying to God.
 His lips uttered mantras that thanked God for the gift of sight.
 Molo was right next to him shrouded in studied silence, half kneeling in
 a praying stance.
 His features now were much more grizzled and harsher than when he had left
 his master's curatorium.
 He felt quite a different man these last few days, and it showed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was not just that he was leaner, more muscle and thin skin than bone
 or fat.
 His body had become somewhat stringent but it also felt much more resilient
 and less drawn to earthly needs, more attuned with the realities of the
 surrounding world.
 It was the walk through the desert that was to blame, though Molo did not
 consider such change unwanted.
 Indeed, he felt it was a blessing made manifest.
 A blessing from the God that he had mocked and shunned but had also seen
 with his own eyes and felt on his bare skin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He believed now.
 Of all the things that he had imagined when he had set out, this was the
 most unexpected, and quite laughably so.
 Still, it was indeed as the Pilgrim had put it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

God provides
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It provided him with a companion, with faith and truth; a guiding path,
 a light that shone each day and showed him the meaning of existence in
 a handful of sand and a patch of clear blue sky.
 It was the same God that had created this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had scolded himself for his previous feelings and thoughts.
 Faith, as he now saw in his enlightened mind, did not exclude logic or
 slave men to a body of lies, a life of unhappiness and endless toil.
 It enhanced it, it magnified its significance, it gave men purpose; it
 gave them a hard background of impossibilities against which they could
 measure themselves and the world around them.
 It provided a challenge.
 Once God was proven to exist, what more was there to find out other than
 to see His true face, comprehend His plan and follow its perfection to
 whatever end awaited each one? The Pilgrimage was the way to God's Land,
 as well as His heart and mind, the only way to talk to Him and listen His
 voice resound through a man's soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It had happened once already, even before they had reached the Garden of
 God.
 It was not a Necropolis, it could not have been.
 The word was blasphemous, portraying God as something unliving, dead, withered
 and gone.
 Perhaps God was gone, leaving for reasons only He could fathom.
 But the echoes of His footsteps still roamed in His Land, each grain of
 sand carried His imprint.
 It was certain to him, clear as water from a spring.
 The touch of God was in everything, even in the storm that had spared them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In that moment, Molo had become a believer.
 He cast aside the hard grasp of logic and lifted the barricades of his
 reason to let the shining light of true faith enter.
 He saw God, felt his presence and accepted his truth.
 It was so very simple, if one could just walk in His Land.
 It changed a man, whether he wanted to or not.
 He did not believe there could exist a man or woman born of flesh and capable
 of feeling, that would not be humbled by such a peregrination.
 Even himself, a man who had killed another man in cold blood, without guilt
 or the evidence of conscience, could be made to see God in this place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He ended his prayer with the sign of God, and the Pilgrim next to him stood
 up with feet planted in the still warm sand.
 Holding the guiding stone reverently, his body followed the stone's guiding
 light, gazing the dunes that beckoned before them like rolling waves of
 sand frozen in time.
 But they moved, Molo had seen now.
 They moved with a speed that belied their size, their sand shifting slowly
 but endlessly with every tiny gust of air, like a trickle that never ceased
 to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was why it would be impossible to find one's way in the Land of God without
 His touch guiding a man, without His help, without a stone.
 No landmarks whatsoever, nothing to measure distance by anything other
 than your own steps; steps that faded in the sand like when the sea washes
 over them with each wave.
 And those who did not have faith would certainly drift until their life
 was claimed, whether on sea or on sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim then turned to Molo and pointed to him with a smile, letting
 his unusually healthy white pearly teeth shine brightly in the first rays
 of the suns.
 Molo smiled back and greeted him in High Helican, feeling warm inside for
 the first time in many years; perhaps for the first time since he was a
 child, before his master took him in.
 He said to the Pilgrim in a clear, resounding voice:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo's slight bow made him let out a deep and rumbling laugh, like the sound
 of rocks tumbling down into a river.
 His brother's face was puzzled, but he seemed eager to learn of what he
 had said or done wrong, what it was that had made him so unassumingly merry
 all of a sudden.
 The Pilgrim felt the moment could serve well to enlighten his brother with
 some words of wisdom which should be seldom needed, but not unjustly so.
 He looked at Molo with the caring look of an older brother, and said to
 him under the light of the rising suns:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo seemed slightly put-off, as if taken aback from such a question.
 It troubled him, but he did not try to conceal it.
 It was a human gesture, admitting one's imperfection eagerly without guilt,
 shame or regret.
 It was a good sign that his brother was now more open to him, almost transparen
t for all to see.
 Perhaps it was the test of faith that had turned his heart so much brighter.
 It had lit the fire of his faith anew.
 He himself had almost faltered in his quest.
 It was only understandable that his newly found brother would do so as
 well at some point.
 They were only human; it was expected of them.
 But God had supported them in their time of need.
 As always, God provided.
 As if trying to steer his mind away from a dark precipice, Molo was careful
 with his words, not only because the language was difficult to speak properly,
 but because he found the Pilgrim's question deeply incisive, the answer
 still unknown to him.
 His voice was hushed and slow, while each word seemed to carry the weight
 of many different truths:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I seek God himself, brother.
 Though that would have been a lie a few days ago, it is now truth.

 faith in finding him.
 Now I do, more than ever.
 It is comforting to know you were somehow right, even when you were wrong.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim raised a hand at that remark, looking at Molo with intensity
 and even wariness.
 He told him crisply, his words coming out of his mouth harsh and unyielding,
 very much unlike his usual meek and irenic manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Man is always wrong, he is never right.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo was genuinely surprised.
 The Pilgrim had scolded him with ferocity, as if he had defiled something
 sacred.
 That had not been Molo's intention though and he lowered his gaze, in silent
 acceptance of his transgression.
 He knew he still had a long way to go if he was ever to redeem himself.
 Thessurdijad Molo felt he had been born anew in that storm, but that also
 meant he had to learn how to walk, and talk, from the beginning.
 The Pilgrim went on, this time his voice mellow and soft, understanding
 his brother would never transgress in such a way again:

 It has happened before.
 We are only men.
 We err.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo nodded at those words thoughtfully, but not simply because of the Pilgrim's
 candor.
 It was one of the first times he wasn't nodding simply because he meant
 to agree or accept the other man's words.
 This time he felt the weight behind the words, and he felt them squarely
 on his mind.
 The Pilgrim gave a small pause and then continued, in somewhat accented
 but still quite understandable High Helican:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 This world is tainted and even in his Gardens we must be vigilant.
 The archenemies always seek to invade your mind, poison your soul and destroy
 your faith.
 Have faith brother and empty your soul.
 Humble yourself, see the true path like before and let us walk on it hand
 in hand.
 God will provide.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim ended his small talk with a reassuring smile and clasped Molo's
 arm with his own.
 He looked at his brother, and felt the troubled soul that lay deep within
 him.
 He ached for his brother, but all he could do was stand by him, pray and
 wish for him to overcome whatever doubt and fear held his faith back, and
 turn the trickle of his soul into a torrent of faith and love, an unbridled
 force of nature, one that only God could spur in a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo returned the smile, but only faintly; his mind was focused on the deep
 thoughts the words of the Pilgrim had given birth to.
 It was just as well to think about his past, his present and his future,
 all through the prism of the one truth that had been revealed to him to
 hold above others: God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He resolved that he would ask whatever came to mind, and he would answer
 whatever the Pilgrim wanted to ask.
 It seemed though that the Pilgrim's questions would be enough, sharp as
 a tiger's claws, hard as rock and stone.
 For the first time in his journey, he wished he had more time before they
 reached their destination; more time to prepare himself and his soul for
 what lay ahead.
 Because Molo now knew in his heart, that this journey could claim his soul
 as well as his life.
 It would be ironic to lose one's soul only a little while after he'd found
 out he had one to begin with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim began walking towards the point in the horizon the stone had
 shown earlier.
 He gestured for Molo to follow without another word.
 Molo seemed consternated, because they had been walking all night, again.
 What little water they found at times just before dawn, was barely enough
 to sustain them.
 It felt unwise to continue without resting, to exert their bodies beyond
 their limits of tolerance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He did not voice his concern though; he knew it was not necessary and only
 wasteful.
 The Pilgrim motioned this time with even more vigor, bowing slightly and
 gesturing with both hands.
 For an instant Molo was reminded of an usher of festivities or a lordly
 servant, but such an image did not do the Pilgrim any justice.
 A few days ago, Molo would have mocked him in low Helican, but now he felt
 only ashamed he would have done such a thing to the man that had kept him
 alive, body and soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The suns had come up by that time, casting their light across the dry landscape.
 The Pilgrim brought out his shelter stone and touched it with both hands.
 A shadowy bubble seemed to shimmer around them for a while, before it turned
 completely transparent.
 It seemed to have lost some of its former capacity to shelter them, like
 an awning suddenly becoming thinner, tattered.
 Whatever lay in God's plan, it seemed that this stone would rather sooner
 than later stop working properly.
 The heat was not scorching but it was more intense than the day before,
 and the light that entered through the stone's invisible protective barrier
 was certainly brighter.
 Nevertheless, Molo started walking, trying not to fall behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He wondered if the Pilgrim knew, though he was more concerned with how to
 broach this subject, lest it be considered blasphemy or an affront to God.
 Though he now believed, he also was not blind to the fact that these stones
 though probably considered holy artifacts and for good reason, where some
 sort of technological marvel, not vessels of divinity.
 Highly evolved technology could be easily misunderstood for a divine miracle,
 a work of God.
 Molo felt he could help these people understand their past, and they could
 help him shape his future.
 `God willing', he added to his series of thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They had been walking over thick sand for the better part of an hour, every
 one of their steps sinking visibly up to their ankles, slowing their pace
 considerably, sapping their strength with every passing minute.
 The creatures of the desert that had sustained them were gone now; this
 was no-man's land, a veritable patch of dead sand.
 Yet, God lived here.
 The realization of that contradiction led to a strange flux of feelings
 in Molo; he felt serenely calm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But at the same time there was anxiety in his heart, wariness; a feeling
 of lurking danger.
 It could be the feeling the Pilgrim had warned him about.
 It could be some primeval sort of warning emanating deep from within.
 It could all just be the effects of wearing down his body, having walked
 constantly for half a day or more with just a couple of mouthfuls of water
 and not a single bite of food.
 He felt he had to ask the Pilgrim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim did not stop, neither did he slow down.
 He simply carried on, using his walking stick to help him propel himself
 forward, as if it was a row for the sand.
 He did not turn to look at Molo, but rather replied in a crisp, somewhat
 stringent voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There will be no rest from now on, brother.
 The stone has served its purpose diligently for many years.

 lasts.
 So we walk.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
`So he does know the stone is failing,' Molo thought.
 He then felt it would not be inappropriate to ask more of the Pilgrim,
 the strain from the arduous walking evident in his voice, gasps of breath
 between his questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The Pilgrim brought a hand up, a gesture that implied Molo should be silent.
 His hand briefly occluded the two suns, offering Molo a small patch of
 shadow so he could look at the Pilgrim with more ease.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo went silent for a few moments and lowered his head, trudging behind
 the Pilgrim who seemed to be little more than inconvenienced by the difficult
 terrain.
 He still seemed troubled though and voiced his concern, of a different
 nature this time:

 He simply glanced sideways when he told him:

With that, they both returned to a silence that seemed to be so natural
 in the desert, the only sound the continued murmur of grains of sand shifting
 and turning, swirling in the air; an eternal dance to the whims of the
 wind.
 Molo could only nod in mute acceptance and walk behind the Pilgrim, the
 sound of his feet sinking in the desert sand, keeping pace with the beats
 of his heart.
 The suns were on the rise, soon it would be noon.
 All around them, he could see nothing but sand.

\begin_layout Standard

Dusk was only a few hours away.
 Molo was exhausted, every muscle aching but the ones in his legs simply
 burned with searing pain.
 It was impossible for him to go any further without resting first.
 Molo thought the Pilgrim would resort to actually dragging him behind him
 in the desert, but that had remained only something in Molo's fantasy.
 They had stopped for the day, the heat of the desert slowly diminishing
 but its echoes still faint in the evening breeze, a warm wind that could
 have been almost pleasant if it did not carry all that sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were resting in the shadow of a tall white obelisk, otherwise unadorned
 and plain, demanding attention by its sheer size and apparent uniqueness,
 dominating the desert landscape.
 They had first seen it when the suns were high up above at midday, a gray-blue
 silhouette in the horizon.
 It had taken them until before dusk to finally reach it.
 It was a tall obelisk with a wide base, and on one of its four sides the
 gleaming glossy white material it was mostly made of seemed to be peppered
 with tiny little holes, as if it was porous and sponge-like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He could not know for certain, but though indeed impressive somehow, the
 obelisk did not seem monumental and awe-inspiring.
 It felt more like a building, or a post; something long abandoned even
 though it was in perfect shape apparently.
 It did not seem as if it had been erected by man but rather like it had
 always been there, heedless of the sandy winds and scorching heat.
 The Pilgrim had stood aghast when he saw it and in reverent tones started
 reciting from memory, his only source of knowledge:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo had repeatedly asked whether or not this was what they were looking
 for, whether or not their journey drew closer to an end, but the Pilgrim
 had simply told him that he would see for himself, if he was indeed humble
 and faithful.
 That had quietened Molo down, who felt the excitement was perniciously
 keeping him out of focus, making his thoughts and hopes stray from the
 one true path he was now walking: the path of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps indeed the archenemies were lurking around, their malignancy somehow
 trying to veer him away from his newly found purpose, driving him to dark
 corners of his mind he did not wish to revisit.
 Perhaps it was simply himself, still trying to come to terms with his new
 identity as a believer; not an avaricious atavist, not a cold-blooded killer,
 not a man seeking to empower himself with unsurpassed might and hidden
 knowledge whatever the cost.
 That was the kind of man Molo had known.
 His new self, he had to learn as he went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The shade of the white pristine obelisk was comfortable enough for them
 to sit down, and perhaps sleep in the still warm sand, using it as a sort
 of blanket.
 What was even more refreshing was the water the obelisk produced, a small
 recess in its base readily appearing as if a lever had been pulled, with
 an unnerving lack of sound.
 It had opened with a simple touch of the Pilgrim, as if he had been here
 many times before and quite intimately knew the workings of such a thing.
 When questioned about that, the Pilgrim had merely shrugged and said to
 Molo, `God always provides'.
 It was an unanswered mystery that could very well remain so, if it meant
 fresh, cool, and potable water would be readily available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As they were sitting at the base of the obelisk, their eyes would not leave
 it alone.
 The Pilgrim was offering a reverent gaze to it, seemingly musing about
 the workings of God in His Land, engrossed in thought and prayer.
 Molo's visage was that of a man preoccupied with troubling sensations and
 feelings of unease.
 True enough, the obelisk had saved them from dehydration and death, and
 even though food was still unavailable, and their progress seemed to be
 slower, water was more important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
But what really raced in his mind was the opportune moments.
 The storm clearing away from them harmlessly instead of leaving their bones
 to bleach under the suns.
 Finding the obelisk right about when the desert was surely going to claim
 them.
 Was it really God that had provided, or was there more to such blissful
 and timely divine providence? Molo felt unsure and uneasy, the latter due
 in part to the former.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Esphalon came to his mind, since he had mentioned divine providence as well.
 Was it a common theme? Was the desert and its extreme environment the one
 to blame for the changes he was going through? Was it a trick of perception,
 a misstep of the mind? Was it simply a coping mechanism? The array of questions
 that seemed to come unbidden to his weary mind suddenly became overwhelming.
 He had to give pause to rest and clear his mind; then he could search within
 and without to find his answers.
 Maybe, as the Pilgrim had told him, it was true that the burden lay on
 him.
 It was time he had some sleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He made the sign of God right before the hour of dusk signaled its approach,
 coloring the thin line between the land and the sky with a violet shade
 of crimson and a deep blue, like the ocean sea.
 He knelt and prayed, the newly found solace in that simple act soothing
 his troubled mind.
 The Pilgrim next to him did likewise and right before Molo laid himself
 down, curling with only his cloak to cover him up, he talked to him affording
 him a preciously warm and friendly look:

Molo looked away from the Pilgrim, into the setting suns that grazed the
 dunes afar with the last light of the day; two glowing rings of brightness
 worn around the shadow of the low dunes.
 He took his time before answering but when his reply came it rang true,
 crystal clear and genuine:

The Pilgrim spoke no more, and silently closed his eyes.
 He laid himself down to sleep, the lukewarm sand's embrace his body's only
 comfort.
 Molo felt enthusiasm try and take hold of his sense and his mind, but he
 thought of the Pilgrim's words and his advice.
 He looked once more into the fading horizon and noticed Pyx was starting
 to rise once more, to reign over the desert like a prince of the night.
 He let his feelings of enthusiasm go and tried to empty his mind.
 It would all be revealed in time, he could trust in that.
 He slept then, his body welcoming the absolute stillness.
 He had hoped for dreams that would guide him, but none came.

The Pilgrim woke him up with a jolt to his sides, and a tug at his vest.
 It felt abrupt and violent, but it seemed the Pilgrim had good reason for
 it.
 Before Molo could stand up on his feet, he could see in the still darkness
 of the night the starlight casting their hard shadows against the sand.
 The Pilgrim had a finger to his mouth, instructing Molo to remain silent.
 He even noticed he was holding his breath in an effort to not make a sound.
 He knew they were in danger now and the Pilgrim's attitude only served
 to strengthen that belief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Something was amiss around them.
 The Pilgrim had felt it first and was now trying to uncover it.
 A sense of hidden menace hung in the air, as if night itself had suddenly
 turned against them.
 They exchanged wary looks and the Pilgrim extended his arms to help Molo
 up to his feet, his movements exuding a strangely purposeful grace, as
 if he was moving with an entirely new purpose now.
 Indeed, once Molo was standing upright, the Pilgrim gestured him to stay
 put with the palm of his hand and silently drove off into the night towards
 a small mound of sand that seemed to block their view to the north.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was barefooted and he moved impossibly fast, with the grace of a cat.
 The Pilgrim barely touched the sand, his feet almost failing to impress
 themselves on the desert floor.
 He had drawn his knife and was grasping it with his right hand with his
 torso somewhat swiveled, ready to deliver a forceful blow; his body seemed
 ready to spring in action, putting as much of his weight and strength behind
 his knife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo had frozen in place, trying to gather his wits and his senses.
 He could not know what had alerted the Pilgrim but he could feel its presence
 as well.
 They were in danger, that much was clear.
 He suddenly felt naked, without even a simple weapon in hand.
 He saw the Pilgrim had left his walking stick behind; a sturdy piece of
 wood, gnarled and light.
 Judging that a piece of wood would offer him better protection than his
 bare hands, Molo picked it up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He walked as silently as possible, much more slowly than the Pilgrim, his
 feet sinking in the sand effortlessly.
 Molo tried to wield the piece of wood like a distaff holding it with both
 hands, but he saw its length was badly suited to such a task, so he grasped
 it with both hands from one end, like a club.
 The Pilgrim was approaching the top of the sandy mound.
 He had reduced his stature to a bent shape and his pace to a crawl.
 He appeared to Molo as a cougar or a mountain lion, ready to spring up
 on its prey with vicious speed and cold fury, only because of lethal necessity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was so very much unlike him to act in such a way.
 It was as if a heathen warrior of old myth and folk tales had come into
 life before him.
 Perhaps it was indeed so; perhaps these myths had their origins in the
 people of the Pilgrim, the believers of God.
 Molo had never thought of him in such a light, judging him to be a serene
 and mellow man; a sensitive mind in a frail body.
 It seemed that some people hid more than met the eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he himself approached the crouching figure of the Pilgrim, Molo saw him
 turn his head and look at him with an exasperated look, probably because
 he was making too much noise in an otherwise eerily silent desert.
 He gestured Molo once more to be silent and still.
 Molo complied, understanding that it was unwise of him to go running after
 the Pilgrim, heedless of the noise he was making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
A smell of iron and sparks permeated the air suddenly, wafting over the
 crest of the mound.
 It was not very much unlike the smell often found in blacksmith shops and
 forges, though its exact nature eluded him.
 It was sharper and more acrid; it almost felt like it stung the eyes.
 It was not a good sign, it felt wrong and unnatural.
 His body tensed and the Pilgrim seemed to be on the edge as well, the fingers
 of his hand opening and closing in rapid succession around the knife's
 haft in nervous anticipation.
 The air thickened with alarming speed and the smell grew stronger; then
 he saw it appear over the crest, strange thin beams of light sprouting
 from what might have been a head of sorts: a glistening metal hulk glinted
 under the starlight, uniformly gray and unassumingly blocky, a rectangle
 slab larger than a man.
 The Pilgrim saw it too and sprung up like a coiled snake, his hand making
 a large slashing motion at the metal slab delivering a glancing blow and
 then rolling back down the slope of the mount, tumbling and coming to rest
 at what seemed like a safer distance from the metal slab.
 He was a few feet away from Molo when he shouted, all reasons for silence
 and discretion gone.
 His stare was focused on the metal slab slowly coming their way, improbably
 keeping itself afloat half a foot above the sand:

Molo was confused, though his feet and legs moved like they had ears of
 their own.
 A floating slab of gray metal had appeared in the middle of the night out
 of nowhere, and the Pilgrim had attacked it to no avail with his knife.
 And now they were running.
 At least, he was.
 Running towards the obelisk, the Pilgrim left behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim wasn't running; instead he was hefting the knife from one hand
 to the other, as if looking for a sturdier grip in a better fighting stance.
 He looked at his face and all he saw was calm acceptance, a knowledgeable
 expression in his face, as if he was ready body and mind for what would
 follow soon.
 He did not see defiance or strength of spirit.
 He saw a man who felt his end was near, but was determined to make it count,
 somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Molo was almost halfway to the obelisk, when the realization struck him:
 What logic lay there in reaching the obelisk? What reason was there to
 run and pray, while the Pilgrim made a last stand that felt so vacant and
 void of meaning?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He stopped suddenly then and started running towards the Pilgrim and the
 coming metal fiend.
 As he ran with as much speed as the sand at his feet allowed him, he grasped
 the stick with both hands, ready to swing it around as hard as possible.
 He could not leave the Pilgrim alone in this.
 Molo asked himself what use were a knife and a stick against a floating
 slab of metal.
 If it had come to kill them, it suddenly felt more appropriate that they
 should die together, fighting as if they could someday win.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim saw him with the corner of his eye rushing to meet the slab.
 It seemed to Molo that he opened his mouth to say something, his eyes flashing
 red with anger.
 All the while, the slab had come within reach of the Pilgrim.
 As Molo swung the stick putting all the speed of his body behind the blow,
 he could see the knife shattering on impact, and a black band of glass
 in the middle of the slab.
 An instant later a red flicker of light filled his sight and his feet seemed
 to disobey him.
 Everything went dark and mute, as all sensation fled his body.
 His last thoughts were that death was nothing to be afraid of.

Major Guighan relayed the General's order to the signals' officer with a
 nod and a gesture of his hand.
 The signals' officer then communicated it by a hand gesture to a soldier
 who held two colored flags.
 The soldier began waving the flags in a specific pattern repeatedly.
 In the far distance where the siege engine battalion was arrayed, an answering
 wave of flags could be seen shortly thereafter.
 The signal had been acknowledged.
 A few moments later, a single red flag was raised in answer and held there.
 The signals officer attached to the General gave a nod, and the flag-bearer
 raised another, similar red flag.
 Major Guighan reported to Tyrpledge:

The General was looking at the City of Pyr with a strange mixture of intensity
 and sadness.
 He was standing upright, tensed on the back of his horse which lay unmoving,
 steadfastly following its riders commands like a valued trained warhorse
 should.
 The sight filled the General with grim determination.
 The plans had been laid out, his brigadiers had been notified and each
 one had received orders and acknowledged.
 Everything seemed to be progressing in a professional manner.
 For the most part the General's mind was preoccupied with the situation
 as a whole, not simply the battle that was soon to follow.
 A small part though was still focused on matters that had to be dealt there
 and then, such as receiving reports and issuing the right orders.
 That part of his mind answered to the Major with a flat, blatantly emotionless
 voice:

Major Guighan saluted and walked briskly to the signals officer to assemble
 a suitable message per Tyrpledge's request.
 The General seemed to survey the assemblage of men, horses and machine
 laid out around the City of Pyr, but in truth his vision was blurry and
 out of focus; his mind was engrossed in thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There would be no misunderstandings and no confusion before battle was joined.
 The position of each brigade of men around the City could be easily regarded
 from the small hill the General had chosen as his headquarters.
 Major Guighan had proposed the specific site and Tyrpledge was pleased
 to see that his adjutant was an adroit tactician, equally skillful on the
 map as well as in the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The General had embarked on a journey of reminiscence in his mind.
 The smell of the battlefield was brought up from memory.
 It was the smell of blood and decaying bodies.
 There was no such thing as the smell of victory and defeat, they both were
 foul to the senses and he could not discern the real difference between
 them.
 In the end, it had always smelled sweetly sick and coppery.
 Like a feast gone horrible wrong; a feast for Gods that hunger for life.
 He smirked then, at the unbidden thoughts that had reminded him of bad
 poetry and idle philosophers trying to cloud his mind before a battle.
 He was a soldier; he had his orders and his oaths to follow, unto death
 if the need came.
 That was a soldier's life he knew, he had painfully learned it; dying a
 violent death, hoping something good came out of it.
 What good would come out of this regrettable affair though, the General
 could scarcely imagine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had seen quite a bit of action in the Pacification of Zaelin, a recently
 promoted centarch at that time.
 It had been his first and last taste of bloody battle, until now.
 He did not relish this second chance at smelling death once again though.
 War had always had little to do with reason, but somehow it always made
 sense before battle was joined.
 Duty, honor, valor: one of those always appeared in one form or another,
 demanding to be the focus of every fighting man.
 He found honor and valor to have nothing to do with this battle which could
 easily turn into a slaughter.
 And duty could be facing either way.
 The men inside the city felt they had a duty as well.
 Were they entirely wrong to uphold that duty?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He found himself questioning his actions once more.
 But he had never questioned his allegiance.
 It was simply the images of unwanted carnage which would soon take place
 that filled him with regret and remorse.
 He felt such feelings though should be reserved for another time, after
 the battle would end.
 Whether it would be won or lost actually mattered little.
 Blood would be spilled, the blood of his fellow men; would the innocent,
 the women and the children, would they be spared in the heat of battle?
 That much was certain: No one escapes the wrath of war.
 Some are simply caught in its path, and learn before their end that fate
 is a mindless, uncaring maelstrom.
\end_layout

 of Major Guighan jolted him back into the surrounding reality:

Major Guighan waved with his hand in the air, circling a finger.
 The signals officer stood erect with both hands outstretched.
 An array of flag-bearers raised their black flags and soon the dull thuds
 of huge ropes snapping and the metal clicks and clacks of springs and plates
 being released reached the General's ears from an uncanny distance.
 Flaming barrels of oil and tar seemed to spread over the city like a death-embl
azoned fiery fan, while large rocks and steely spiked balls converged on
 a single section of the walls, falling down upon them like a hail of doom.

The Patriarch was dressed in resplendent fashion wearing red velvet robes
 adorned with finely-cut jewels, glistening brightly in various hues under
 the bright light of the suns.
 It was the time before noon; he was standing atop the eastern tower of
 the Disciplinarium, the horizon filled with the daunting sight of the massed
 armies of the Outer Territories, waging war against the city of Pyr.
 The siege engines had commenced their attack against the city walls, and
 already large chunks of the seemingly unyielding walls had begun to tumble
 down, debris filling the deep moat that had been hurriedly dug the very
 same morning behind the section under attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Patriarch stood in the middle of the tower with a magnifying glass to
 his eye, surveying the battle.
 Squads of procrastinators stood behind masses of men of all ages who had
 been forced to wield whatever weapon could be found around the city forges
 and blacksmith shops.
 The armory of the disciplinarium had been depleted as well, the procrastinators
 being issued the finest available armor and weapons, while the city folk
 pressed into service had been given whatever could be scrounged in the
 last minute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
These were men bereft of spirit, their faces drawn and pale; seeing their
 ends approaching fast for all they did was accept their fate, which one
 way or another seemed to hold nothing for them.
 They could not be considered as fighters, but merely as sheep headed for
 a slaughter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was folly for anyone among them to believe that this hurriedly assembled
 militia could withstand a determined assault from the experienced, well-trained
 and artfully equipped armies of General Tyrpledge.
 The Patriarch beamed at that prospect and gave a momentary sideways look
 to Ursempyre who was standing a few feet away, an elite guard of procrastinator
 veterans standing between them.
 Ursempyre returned the gaze with a venomous look, but resignation was evident
 in his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He hated the Patriarch with all his heart, but he hated himself even more
 for failing to do everything in his power to avert this damnable catastrophe
 unfolding before his eyes.
 Nothing short of the shackles on his feet prevented him from falling over
 the parapet of the tower to a well-deserved though ignominious death.
 The Patriarch had forced these upon him when Ursempyre's first attempt
 from the balcony below had failed, prevented by the Patriarch's awesome
 powers who had stunned Ursempyre and rendered him unable to even flicker
 an eyelid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had been scolded playfully like a troublesome child and was now being
 tormented, forced to witness his people slay each other in a staged battle,
 as the wicked stage-play the Patriarch had written was about to unfold.
 Everything was fake, everything was a lie; except for the blood that would
 soil the ground and seep through every stone in the city.
 Ursempyre was denied even the release of death, such was the malevolence
 and evil of the Patriarch.
 An affront to life itself.
 These thoughts made him physically sick, and he vomited despite himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Patriarch noticed and let out a derisive snort, full of mockery; the
 pleasure derived from Ursempyre's utterly broken figure lacing every word
 of his:
\end_layout

Ursempyre spat, trying to clear his mouth.
 He felt though that nothing could wash away the bitterness inside, the
 foul lies and deceit the Patriarch sowed with his every word an almost
 tangible pool of bile.
 He felt unclean, soiled by the fiendish being's mere physical presence.
 He might have been broken and resigned of hope but there was no meaning
 for him in indulging the Patriarch's sick sense of humor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He did not answer; indeed he had decided he would not answer the Patriarch's
 goads.
 He simply stared at him through eyes blackened with rage and sorrow, the
 skin underneath sagging from his lack of sleep, a pallid bloodless complexion
 instead of his usual healthy color.
 The Patriarch had stopped observing the movement of the armies.
 He started pacing around the roof of the tower.
 His guards were standing like unblinking statues at strict attention, as
 if they were oblivious to what was transpiring before their eyes, or simply
 did not care.
 It was even possible, Ursempyre thought, that he had blinded them to what
 has happening beyond the roof.
 The Patriarch seemed to be enjoying the cool wind this high up and breathed
 deeply, a grin forming on his face.
 He addressed Ursempyre, sparing him only a small flick of the wrist towards
 him:

 But I digress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The koma bird is known to lay its eggs on the highest mountains, their aeries
 precariously perched on the roughest and deepest of precipices.
 Once the eggs are hatched, the parents feed the newborns for only two days.
 I have not seen it for myself, but I have confirmed the veracity of such
 reports.
 When the hatchlings have been fed, their parents drop them all one by one,
 to either learn to fly or perish in their effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Naturally, most fail to do so.
 Only perhaps one in ten succeed and most komas lay eggs only twice or three
 times in their lives.
 As a consequence, they are quite few and far between, their numbers constantly
 low.
 They are large birds though; their wings span as large as a dozen feet.
 They're excellent fliers, able to soar the skies as high as the clouds
 sometimes and swoop down on their prey with lightning speed.

Ursempyre stirred somewhat, unable though to move his feet shackled as they

 He made a motion with his body towards the Patriarch, and raised his hands
 as if trying to grasp him by the throat.
 However naive and futile it may have seemed, he dearly wished to kill him.
 Instead he asked with a raspy voice and blood-shot eyes that radiated maddening
 hopelessness, a saturnine look on his distraught face:

Will you kill me now, blessed one? Or at least let me kill myself? Have
 you no hope or fear left in this world or any other that you chose me and
 my people as playthings? What womb of evil bore you, still I wonder.
 What eldritch void inside you fills the place of a heart? Such a cruel
 fate as mine I would not wish upon no other, except you.
 Curse you Patriarch, I curse your very soul.
 I believe in no Gods, for if there were any they would have struck you
 down long ago.
 All hope is lost to me, my mind and spirit lie broken, my people will be
 dead by a brother's blade come the night.
 But this I swear to you, Holy Avatar, demon and scourge of us all: You
 will suffer an end far worse than mine, remember that in your dying throes.
 The higher you stand, the harder you fall.

The Patriarch's eyes seemed to glaze for a moment before suddenly becoming
 clear again, the faint cracks of a grin slowly appearing on the Patriarch
 face.
 He seemed to relish the fact that Ursempyre had bitten back an answer,
 even if it was only a curse.
 He bit his lip faintly as if pondering which words were to follow from
 a bustling cloud of possibilities.
 His grin turned into a wide cold smile when he said with a degree of cynical
 mirth:

 A soothsayer as well, a man gifted with visions of the future.
 I am almost impressed.
 The fact that I already know I'm going to die someday does take away some
 of the points in your favor, but I'm glad you tried to make me laugh.
 I would pity you but it's so much more satisfactory to watch you go rampant
 on these mood swings.
 Broken puppet the one minute, fiery rebellious martyr the next.
 Do you think anyone is watching, Ursempyre? Do you think anyone would genuinely
 care about what is happening here? These are the end days of Pyr, my Castigator.
 Breath deeply; let the charcoal gristle on your skin and smell the iron
 heavy in the air.
 That's blood and fire for you, Ursempyre.
 My sermon of blood and fire.

Ursempyre's stare remained on the Patriarch, deeply seated hate emanating
 from his eyes.
 He lowered his trembling arms and sagged his shoulders, speaking in a dim
 echo of his former voice, still audible though over the din of the battle
 surrounding the city and the mayhem caused by the fires who were sprouting
 like incandescent blossoms:

You wish to bless us with your interminable wisdom as well? A parting gift

 here today greets death thinking he had received a lesson well earned?
 Do you see yourself as attending to your flock? How committed! As their
 dying breath leaves them, your guidance will surely be remembered and praised
 when they reach the righteous heaven they await.
 And they will never know the nothingness beyond.
 Is that what you seek, a charnel of souls chanting your name in an afterlife
 that does not exist?

The Patriarch's response was to laugh heartily and come closer to Ursempyre

 tongue and venom coursed in his veins:

You balance on a tight rope, Lord Castigator Remis.
 Do not speak of the afterlife so vainly.
 What would you know about something you so feverishly avoid? Something
 that reeks of the death you people so stridently shy away from, and never
 grasp or understand.
 I've died and been reborn a thousand times, and yet another thousand more
 I shall.
 It is a circle, that's all there is.
 Even stars collide and die in terrific splendor, while others silently
 ebb away and vanish as if they never were.
 Yet their light reaches everywhere, Ursempyre.

Would you know what a star's death feels like, Remis? I know.
 I've seen with bare blinded eyes.
 I've watched worlds consumed in the dying flames of their stars.
 I've witnessed billions spill their blood willingly on a whim of mine,
 chanting my name in unison.
 And you would dare insinuate before my very presence indeed, that my sermon
 is a charade, a mockery designed to bring you low? Do you think so highly
 of yourselves? And you have the ignorant audacity to call me a blasphemer
 and an affront to life.
 How petulantly ironic.
 But only understandable.
 Though if I were you I would have kept my mouth and ears shut, unable to
 fathom or understand a single moment of the numbing madness around me.
 In that respect, I can almost admire you.
 But you test my limits, Ursempyre.
 And I do have limits that I only very rarely reach.
 Perhaps it's the real reason I'm keeping you alive.
 A sort of challenge.
 A test of character.

 I shall spur them onwards to a great struggle against the treacherous blaspheme

Faint light entered the quarters they had sequestered for her and her newborn
 child.
 It was not so much a room as it was a crevice, a hollowed out cavity of
 rock somewhere underneath the city, just another small cave forming part
 of a complex network whose size she could only guess.
 Her mind wandered to such meandering thoughts whenever Amonas came to mind.
 Their child was here in her bosom, being fed for the first time.
 Where was the father? Where was her love?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

An instant later her eyes locked with the tiny sparkling things that were
 her baby's windows into the world, and saw the crystal blue water of the
 oceans staring back at her.
 She could almost hear the gurgling of virgin waterfalls in his small cries
 and throaty sounds.
 The boy was a heart-tearing reminder of his father, even from the way he
 stretched when he fell asleep kindly, craning his neck before it settled
 cosily on her chest.
\end_layout

He had only been born the night before in a damp cave full of strident men,
 their endless, mirthless cacophony silenced by the sudden and unexpected
 cries of a child gasping for air and a mother suffering the pains of labor.
 They had turned and looked with astonishment; their croaks and hawkish,
 almost unintelligible cries had been choked in concert, replaced with whispers
 of amazement and gasps of wonder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The two men had been very kind and helpful to her, mindful of her dignity
 as a lady.
 A doctor was among the crowd of kinsfolk, and he alone was allowed to attend
 to her.
 Some more men offered to hold their cloaks and form a screen for her to
 give birth in something that could almost equal a privacy of sorts under
 the unfortunate and inappropriately timed circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She had given birth then and there, amongst the company of complete strangers
 but somehow the feeling in her heart was that she was among family indeed,
 something more than friends.
 The kinsfolk seemed to embrace her the minute they saw her distress and
 need.
 After her labor, all that remained of the pain was a numb memory.
 Her heart soared as high as the suns when she laid her eyes upon her son
 for the first time, and she wept from joy.
 Only after the doctor asked of the boy's father, did she shed tears of
 sorrow.

The men in the large underground chamber had been in constant fruitless
 debate only minutes before, but the sight of a woman seeking refuge and
 help stirred them to action and concordance.
 In her matter there were no voices in disarray, no arduous discussions
 with no end.
 They offered their help and assistance immediately, as if she were to them
 a sister, a wife; indeed like a mother to them all.
 Someone sent for nursemaids to attend to her and see to the child.
 Others pulled their cloaks and stripped themselves of their clothes to
 make something soft for her to lay on, as well as sheets to feel warm in
 the dampness of the cave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They all seemed eager to help in any way they could.
 The birth had seemed to offer some sort of rest from their incessant deliberati
ons that had seemed to lead to nowhere in particular, far from an agreement.
 She was not told the details, but they had been trying to decide what their
 next action would be.
 As far as she knew, laying in her makeshift cot and cradling her baby in
 his serene sleep, they had yet to reconvene and decide while at the same
 time a young girl that brought her water had told her the army had begun
 the attack on the walls of Pyr only minutes ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
And still these people waited, idly sitting on their hands, knowing not
 what to do.
 The thought painted her face with a bitter grimace.
 What good would it do them, hiding in these caves wishing everything that
 caused them trouble would simply go away? Was this the kinsfolk indeed?
 Were these people ready to give their lives at the flick of an eye in a
 moment's notice, for a bright future free of tyranny and lies?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She found it hard to believe.
 Perhaps they were indeed good men through and through, but this reluctance
 to commit openly to battle, however grim and dark their chances were, had
 the smell of cowardice about it.
 She did not wish to dwell on that thought any longer though; it would only
 make her remember Amonas and the pain inside would make her cry like a
 poor lost soul.
 She still had an obligation to her child, and she intended to keep it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Once the child woke up and she regained some of her strength, she would
 ask to see their leader; ask to talk to him and try to stir him into action.
 That was the first and simplest thing that she could do, she thought.
 Make them fight as they should.
 Terror filled her when her mind recoiled at the possibility they just might
 give up; simple-minded fear taking over them, begging for their lives to
 no avail.
 She hoped that would not come to pass, for then that would mean that her
 son's life was forfeit along with everyone else's in these caves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The child seemed to stir slightly, as if his sleep was troubled.
 Her brow furrowed at the thought that perhaps he was already sensing there
 was something wrong with the world he had been delivered into: it was harsh,
 demanding, and uncaring, but did her son have to know so soon? Perhaps
 he could sense the absence of his father's touch.
 She certainly did so, and felt a twinge in her heart as she saw a shadow
 touch the cloth screen to her chamber.
 Her heart skipped a beat hoping it was him, that it was Amonas who had
 at last come back to them both.
 But her mind told her otherwise, and soon her eyes proved her heart wrong
 once more.

The shadow belonged to the young girl that had been called to tend to her.
 She had brought her a small basket of food, and a jug of water.
 She looked up at the young girl who was eying her sheepishly, afraid to
 make eye contact as if Celia were some noble woman or a priestess of some
 sort.
 The girl had hair like amber fire and held a small lantern, letting off
 just enough light for her to find her way in the dark maze of caves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The girl approached Celia with hesitation, and left the small basket of
 food at her feet where she lay.
 There was some honey-bread in the basket, some goat's milk and boiled eggs
 as well; a small feast indeed under the circumstances.
 Perhaps they had brought some supplies down with them or had stashed some
 from beforehand, in case of an emergency.
 Still, they were being deprived of food that would be surely needed sooner
 or later.
 It only meant these were indeed good men, and caring people.

 so as not to wake him up.
 Celia managed to stand up on her own, though she felt her sense of balance
 was off and her feet felt heavy and cumbersome.
 She nodded then to the girl who promptly returned her the child with a
 faint smile on her lips.
 Celia returned the gesture more broadly and nodded for the girl to lead
 the way.
 The girl then picked up her lantern lighting the way for Celia as she turned
 and they left the chamber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
She had been quite dizzy and disoriented from labor when they brought her
 in and she had given only a passing amount of attention to the sprawling
 system of caves that seemed to branch out in many different directions.
 Small chambers of sorts were arrayed almost randomly; some seemed natural
 and some were seemingly carved out by men, the signs of chisel and pickax
 still easily spotted, not eroded by time yet.
 Some seemed to be occupied; many housed families, small and large; children
 trying to play hide and seek in the dimly lit passages that had become
 their impromptu playground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
There was no central passage or hallway to speak of though some of the corridors
 were larger, and she could see men walking past going about some business
 or duty; some were carrying supplies like food and clothes, and even carting
 weapons and armor.
 Each face she saw as she walked about the underground home of the kinsfolk
 was filled with tension, uneasiness and doubt.
 Even in the dim light of a lantern and a few sparingly situated torches,
 it was not difficult for someone to spot the tell-tale signs, especially
 for someone like Celia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

After all she was a dancer, experienced and trained in reading people's
 expressions, understand their feelings and react to them through her performanc

 She almost missed her dancing days, she thought.
 Everything looked brighter then, at least in her memory.
 Perhaps it really was but it might also have been the grim darkness that
 surrounded them, not just the one in the caves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Another thing that struck her as odd was the way people looked at her in
 passing.
 Some did not even register her presence but others turned and went wide-eyed
 with surprise, some pointed and whispered, and some even made movements
 of obeisance, like bowing and nodding reverently.
 No one seemed inclined to stop and ask her what was on their minds, even
 though it was more than certain that she had somehow managed to become
 some sort of popular person.
 It must have been the dramatic circumstances under which these people came
 to know her, crying and shouting in the agony of labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The girl barely talked though she did seem to turn around and look at Celia
 and the baby more than once.
 She also went about the passages, corridors and the larger cavities where
 hallways met with astounding ease, especially considering the poor light
 and lack of distinguishing features in such a maze of wild irregularity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Keeping track of time without sunlight was an almost impossible task.
 In these caves, only faint distant echoes of water dripping down from some
 parts of the rocky ceiling could remind someone of time passing by, the
 sloshing sound of each drop on the cave floor like the tick of those terribly
 intricate clocks men had devised.
 Still, it was impossible to keep count.
 Celia did not know exactly for how long they had been walking but her legs,
 feet and back knew all too well.
 Strained as she was from the labor, she felt her energy drained now from
 the walk.
 It felt as if she had been through a small tour of Pyr itself.
 She thought that might not have been that far from the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As she was about to ask her young guide how much longer they would have
 to walk, the girl stopped short of a small corridor that led to a somewhat
 brightly lit cavity.
 Flickers of light danced about the entrance, as a large torch cast its
 light to the otherwise dark hollowed out space that seemed to connect many
 corridors and passages.
 The girl turned and bowed slightly almost in a curtsy, and pointed Celia
 to the entrance with a slight nod.
 She said:

The girl smiled briefly and nodded before parting company.
 Soon she was lost in the darkness of one of the corridors, her tiny light
 drowned in all the darkness of the caves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Celia entered the brightly lit corridor, always firmly holding her son in
 her arms with some apprehension, a mother's instinct that would not be
 appeased no matter what.
 In front of her she saw a small chamber filled with candlelight, their
 scent more than enough to break the smell of cold damp rock that sometimes
 reminded her of an outhouse.
 Another thing that caught her attention was the sound of jingling bells
 and chimes of some sort making a strange sort of music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The small cave was irregularly shaped in an angular way; the bookcases and
 an old study were massed together near the corner of the jutting rock,
 while a somewhat larger space to the right of the study, a sort of crevice,
 housed a small cot and a cupboard of what at a glance seemed to be antique
 wood.
 A wizened old man was hunched over an over-sized book, while around him
 an assortment of various books, scrolls and maps lay strewn around at random;
 candles had been lit and left in precarious positions with or without holders,
 hot wax dribbling profusely.
 The man was wearing a simple set of robes, brown and unkempt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It reminded her of a minister's surplice but this man's clothing bore no
 resemblance to anything of such pristine delicacy.
 He had not registered her presence, though indeed she had not spoken a
 word nor had she announced herself when she entered the corridor.
 She also saw the source of the strange jingling sounds; the old man was
 wearing a jester's hat, wisps of grizzled white hair jutting out from underneat
h it.
 He otherwise looked quite solemn, his hands tracing the pages of the book
 he was engrossed in.
 At length, she decided it was time to speak.
 At that exact time, her son woke up from his sleep crying loudly in her
 arms and she tried to rock him back to sleep again to no avail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The old man turned to look at her with a startle.
 His brow furrowed with annoyance momentarily but then a hint of recognition
 appeared on his face.
 His voice was pitched high but sweetly grazed by time, lilting and musical;
 the voice of someone with a gift for storytelling:

She realized she was almost screaming now, her anger getting the best of
 her while the child in her arms seemed at least as aggravated as she was,

 The old man sighed and nodded, understanding he had offended Celia somehow.
 He then talked to her earnestly in a clear-cut, straight manner, his tone
 of voice curt and precise:

Celia's face was withdrawn, not even the hint of a smile adorning her features.
 The girl was right; this man reeked of strange tidings and unfamiliar manners.

 above the child's.
 Her silence was his cue to continue:

Celia simply stood there looking at the old man in disbelief.
 He then lifted his hat slightly as if to greet her, and with a trick of
 the hand seemed to produce a baby's rattle which the newly born boy could
 not even hope to grasp yet; its sound though seemed to calm him.
 The baby's crying settled down as if magic had put him in a trance.
 Feeling her slightly distrustful of him, almost wary, the jester made an
 effort to lighten the palpable uneasiness between them and said with a
 wide grin:

 His breastplate was polished to a mirror sheen, reflecting wildly the terrible

 hulks of metal.
 A few hundred feet separated them from the walls of Pyr now and they where

It was an uncommonly hot day for that time of the year: there was barely

It would turn bloody soon enough, and he could only hope deep inside him

The Castigator stood impassively on his own mount, his sight intently set

 His eyes looked glazed and it was as if he was hoping to burn holes on

 He seemed then for a moment to breathe in the air roughly, sniffing it
 audibly, as if searching for a specific scent or perhaps simply enjoying
 the breeze's more tangible qualities: burnt wood and ash from the city
 caught in a blaze, the brushings of steel from sharpened weapons and the

 turned his head and asked Tyrpledge:

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Tyrpledge was somehow caught by surprise at the Castigator's questions.
 It was an incisive, straightforward question, very much unlike the Castigator
 who had hardly spoken since the march to Pyr.
 He had been quite reclusive appearing only once, to stir the army into
 upholding their oaths and taking up arms against their fellow men.
 The act of committing the amassed forces of the Outer Territories to quench
 an uprising in the making did not fit in everyone's mind as yet another
 order.
 The atmosphere was tense surely, and everyone felt the heaviness of these
 moments, from the brigadier general to the lowly soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As such thoughts troubled Tyrpledge his mind had wandered and he had not
 answered the Castigator's question.
 The General believed it would be better to leave it at that.
 The motives and thoughts of the traitorous rebels should be left to their
 own.
 The only thing that mattered was that they were violating Law, and duty
 called for him to stop them.
 That was where his concerns on the issues of the uprising started, and
 that was where they ended.
 He suspected many things which he thought would be extremely unwise to
 voice and would only serve to fog his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Perhaps this was what the Castigator was trying to do; lure him into a treachero
us terrain, bring him into a vulnerable position to sense if he was still
 committed.
 A dangerously cunning man.
 Perhaps he had already entered in a complex scheme of machinations that
 would make the mind numb if they were to be revealed.
 It was just as well, he cared not about such things.
 He trusted his mentor's motto: `A plague leaves survivors in its wake,
 politics does not'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The Castigator's face was wearing a knowing grin, when he asked the General

The General remained calm at the face of an attitude bordering the ridiculous,
 intent only to aggravate him and test his limits as a person and an officer
 for reasons that probably the Castigator found pertinent.
 Instead of indignantly falling so low as to disgrace himself in the middle
 of an ongoing battle, he simply waved his adjutant to come closer.

Major Guighan exchanged a quick glance of apprehension with Tyrpledge, but

 thicker by the hour.
 He responded with a nod and a salute before adding:

Of course, sir.
 Initial reports based on informants within the Ministry and the Disciplinarium
 seem to agree that for an unfathomable reason the Patriarch ordered that
 the Arch-minister be purged of his office, as well as denouncing his piousness
 the Castigator a traitor ex absentia.
 Indeed the Noble Representative Lord Ursempyre Remis has been appointed
 and blessed as the new Castigator by the Patriarch in a formal ceremony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The most helpful piece of information comes from a trickle of fleeing civilians
 that seemed to have fought for their lives to escape Pyr.
 It seems that the Patriarch has been forcing men of all ages to take arms
 against our forces.
 A campaign of terror is under way to force submission to roaming squads
 of procrastinators whose sole mission is to prevent anyone from leaving
 the city as well as press-ganging them into service.
 Physical violence, the use of families as hostages, as well as public execution
s are already in effect.
 There are unconfirmed reports of a cluster of people taking up arms around
 the city with no clear allegiance or purpose.
 As that remains to be seen whether it's true or not, we did not take it
 into account while planning, but we have notified the first wave commanders
 accordingly.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Castigator tried not to show it but he looked impressed by the quality
 and thoroughness of the information, as well as by the crisp, clean manner
 it was delivered with.
 Tyrpledge on the other hand did not hide it at all and had been nodding
 briskly all throughout the Major's report.
 He then urged him to continue with a nod in his direction, seeing that
 he had been waiting for a signal to conclude his briefing, his brief pause
 merely an element of style:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The order of battle is as follows, sir: The two Thorax battalions are attached
 to the main bulk of the infantry leading the assault, laid out in a thin
 double line of troops forming the absolute front line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The swordsmen, spear-men and bowmen are marching right behind the Thorax
 in that exact order, holding standard line formations and keeping their
 distances from each according to specific orders to each commanding brigadier.
 Orders were also issued to prefer men with no relatives in the City of
 Pyr, at least for the first wave.
 Once the siege engines manage to breach the walls, the steamers will rush
 forward through the formations of men which will split in two to make way
 for the machines.
 The steamers will create a safe bridgehead for the swordsmen and pike-men
 to follow close behind, while the bowmen will harass any enemy within their
 range to provide additional cover to the assault force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
That force will proceed to clear the city of enemy resistance, house by
 house and street by street, with the objective being to create a safe corridor
 to the Disciplinarium as well as the Patriarch and the Castigator themselves.
 The specific part of the walls to assault was chosen based on the proximity
 to the Disciplinarium, a factor which will hopefully keep casualties among
 the citizenry as low as possible, and lead to a quick and decisive victory.
 The logic behind such a strategy which is corroborated by our confirmed
 information, is that should these two prominent figures be neutralized,
 any amount of effective resistance will cease to be.

When the Major was done, he stood to attention once more and saluted crisply.
 The Castigator nodded, reminding the General of what could only impossibly
 be a disgruntled but impressed man.
 The Major had been as usually, excellent in his appointed task.
 While the siege engines continued their slow barrage of fire and stone
 and every battalion maneuvered continually so as not to disclose the final
 position of the assault, the General's mind turned inward again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He was thinking morosely, his heart heavy from the reality of such a civil
 war.
 If it came to a fight between brothers or father and son, who could blame
 one for turning against his fellow soldiers, or idly stay his hand and
 cost him his life at the hands of men less sentimental? Battle was no place
 for the soft of heart: it only spared those with a mind empty of doubt,
 bearing cold steel in their hearts as well as their hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He had taken on a strangely serene look.
 He had known this would not be an easy fight to carry through, but he had
 not anticipated it would feel this ugly.
 Perhaps in the end, he could not avoid the politics of a troubled conscience
 that was about to add more lives to its blood toll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
His thoughts were broken and his senses became the focus of total attention
 from his mind: A booming voice seemed to echo from the city of Pyr itself
 as if the air above it had been turned into a giant cone of voice, radiating
 words for everyone to here.
 It seemed impossible that it could be so, though everyone seemed to stop
 in his tracks as if he had been rooted there.
 Everyone had been transfixed by what felt like the voice of the Patriarch,
 sounding as clear as when enunciating the holy words of Law from the Ministry's
 tower.
 What he was now saying though as if he spoke directly to their minds, sounded
 totally different; his voice abrasive beyond human measure, as if razors
 sharpened against coarse stone:

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When the unearthly voice had spoken and its echoes had died out, intense
 light seemed to blossom from a part of the city, as if a small sun had
 been brought down and was struggling to find its place among the skies
 again.
 Behind the glaring blaze of light the Disciplinarium could be seen rising
 above the rest of the city and below it, nothing but huge tongues of flames.
 As the Disciplinarium rose along with most of the hill still attached to
 it, everyone's heads turned to face it and marvel at it, wonder at the
 astounding unreality they were seeing.
 Not a word could be heard; the only moments ago bustling battlefield was
 entombed in silence.
 Only a brooding, deeply rumbling sound like stones carrying the echoes
 of thunder could be heard, and it could only be coming from the ascending
 mass of the Disciplinarium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Suddenly, the huge blue and white flames flickered on and off before finally
 being extinguished.
 A moment passed when everything seemed to remain still.
 The Disciplinarium started falling now and it was about to meet the ground
 it had so majestically parted with only moments ago.
 Everyone cowered before its falling shadow, as if it was coming down on
 their own heads.
 They heard the voice of the Patriarch no more, and felt the earth below
 their feet tremble uneasily.
 The General did not conceal his thoughts when he said:

 of light flickered on and off, casting monstrous shadows on the sleek gray
 metal floor.
 Huge sparks seemed to fly from unfathomable contraptions that seemed to
 be hard at work, showering the improbably high walls with fiery fragments.
 Light was at a premium, its sources the by-products of the industrious
 machines: sparks like lightning, hot rivers of metal, red and yellow fires
 and blue-hot flames; green and violet beams of light against stark gray
 metals, the mirror sheens of gleaming new surfaces reflecting everything,
 multiplying their intensity in a maze of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was an organized mayhem, the machines scattered around as if giants had
 sown them from wildly thrown seeds.
 Some of them seemed to be no larger than Hilderich himself, neatly arrayed
 in rows upon rows on the floor, as if they were awaiting inspection.
 Others towered over them, the size of a small hill or an impossibly high
 castle tower.
 Some were dim and seemed to be inert; others glowed or crackled with fiery
 lights and eldritch sparks, booming and thudding sounds emanating from
 within, some of them humming in unnatural tones.
 To Hilderich, it felt like the machines in this place ate metal and drank
 fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Invariably, everything zipped past Hilderich's sight with a speed that left
 little chance for him to marvel at them leisurely.
 The Prosops had been ferrying them silently but efficiently through the
 maze that the seemingly randomly placed machinery created around them.
 Sometimes a path would construct itself right in front of them as the wheels
 of the vehicle-avatar ate away at the gray sleek shiny floor surface, to
 guide them around or over obstacles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They would travel at speeds where the flustering air would make Hilderich's
 eyes blurry and watery, causing him to squint.
 At other times, long overarching narrow rails would make themselves available
 and the machine would jump over them in a carefree fashion and ride upon
 them, while hundreds of feet below the floor could not be seen, blackness
 and ruin awaiting them should they fall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Somehow though, Hilderich felt untouchable, safe in the care of the Prosops,
 the Centron itself.
 It stood to reason that if any danger lurked around this place, it was
 not the vehicle-machine's erratic but expert maneuvering skills, but rather
 something less obvious and well-hidden, something that had yet to manifest.
 Though feeling safe at the moment, Hilderich kept a watchful eye on his
 surroundings, just in case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He peered beyond his immediate surroundings, beyond the towering grapples
 and unfathomable pillars that crackled with amber lightning.
 In the distance, streams of pure white and blue seemed to pour down from
 the pitch dark ceiling high above, lost in many places where the eyes could
 not follow; driven behind metal behemoths and mazes of pipes and tubes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Immense skeletal structures that reminded Hilderich of upturned boats or
 perhaps very strange looking ships were being worked on, swarms of smaller
 and bigger machines not very much unlike the Prosops buzzing around like
 flies around oxen.
 The sounds and sights in this place reminded him of a playground made for
 giants or a shipyard like no other, the pride and envy of every artisan
 and craftsman.
 What would have driven any minister mad from sheer shock, would certainly
 have burned with a bright gleam of wonder in the eyes of the renowned smithies
 from Repentine and the proud ship-makers of Ulrathi, if they ever saw what
 he could see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The air seemed somehow thick, as if it was filled with the by-products of
 the profoundly industrious machinery around them.
 Monstrously huge shiny claws and arms seemed to move and lift improbable
 loads with surprising ease, other smaller machines flitted like metal birds
 while overhead a lattice of glass tubes that could fit a foaming river
 inside them seemed to emit pulses of intense light.
 The number and workings of the machines were unknown, but Hilderich could
 only suppose they numbered in the tens of thousands, a legion of machines
 and devices of origin and purpose unknown.
\end_layout

Hilderich raised his voice well above its usual tones, trying to make sure
 he would be heard:

A green-yellow aura flicked momentarily around the Prosops and Hilderich;
 a faint sheath-like veil seemed to shimmer slightly in the air.
 Then the loud industrious din subsided, allowing the machine to speak in
 a conversational manner and tone:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The machine swooped down a small ramp that moments before was not there
 and was now steering them down a wide spiraling road that seemed to corkscrew
 around a tower whose top seemed to be perpetually devoured by the darkness
 of the ceiling.
 Dim stripes of red light ran along its length, the base of the tower barely
 visible below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was staring wide-eyed, mesmerized in awe of the immense space
 filled with all sorts of strange and mystifying buildings and constructs.
 His mind was overloaded with wonder and amazement, his senses failing to
 capture faithfully the incredible nature of the Den.
 It felt to him as if a vast stage had been wrought for his pleasure alone,
 designed to woe and subdue him utterly with a tale of fantasy to entrap
 him, body and mind.
 He almost felt it wouldn't be half-bad if that was indeed so, as long as
 his captors would let him watch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He couldn't make out any workers at all: everything on the giant workshop
 floor of the Den seemed to be running, moving and working on its own.
 Hilderich thought that such a sight would cause every minister in the Territori
es to die from shock or drive him instantly insane exposed to such blasphemy
 against the Pantheon.
 Machines acting on their own? their powers unleashed unsupervised, free
 to reign over matter? A hideously impossible thought it would have seemed
 in years past, but it was right there in front of him without a doubt.
 Hilderich queried the Prosops about the lack of personnel in the Den and
 people in general, to which the machine answered with a slight bob and
 a tone of surprise:

 him but managed to restrain his voice from revealing how flustered he felt:

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich instinctively turned his eyes upward trying to perceive what the
 machine had meant, but was quick to realize it was impossible for him to
 see what the comment was about without a mirror.
 He also felt uncomfortable being reminded he was using deception to further
 their goals; he almost cynically realized he would be a fool though if
 he did not make the best use of whatever luck threw in their way.
 If the Centron thought they were visitors and indeed spectators to a game,
 people from an entirely different world altogether, then he'd act the part
 as convincingly as he could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Other worlds, other people; different civilizations and societies.
 His mind was still quite ineffectually trying to cope with the implications
 of the knowledge the Centron had imparted.
 With no real reason to believe the Centron could be lying after everything
 he had seen and been through, Hilderich could hardly contain himself from
 grinning at the expectations these revelations had given birth to.
 No longer would they need to cage their minds in ignorance and fear.
 There were places to see and explore, new things to learn and do.
 Perhaps he could somehow persuade the Centron to help them in such a quest.
 But that would have to wait.
 Amonas was his top priority right now, he felt he owed him as much.
 Besides, his predicament seemed to be just cause for leading them to very
 interesting places, perhaps even the very heart of this Centron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
They were evidently slowing down and the road became wider and less steep.
 In moments, they had reached the base of the tower where a wide porch of
 white porcelain stood before them, fine granite marble semi-circular steps
 leading to an arched gate that seemed to goad them further inside the tower.
 It was an eerily familiar sight, the whole entrance resembling a ministry's
 doorsteps.
 All around them the work continued incessantly, the cacophony of noises
 and the ever-shifting lights a constant reminder of that fact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Prosops laid down Amonas in the same manner that had lifted him up on
 its stretcher-like surface, making him float in mid-air covered in a dim
 blue glow with a slight haze all around him.
 It politely asked Hilderich to get up from his seat and in a series of
 mechanical transformations and shimmering bulbous transmutations, it reshaped
 itself into the egg-like shape, a process which Hilderich found less disconcert
ing now.
 Becoming so easily accustomed to such things was a thought that slightly
 troubled him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Being able to look freely at Amonas again now that he wasn't confined in
 a seat, Hilderich took a good look at him: he seemed perfectly fine, as
 if he were slumbering in the most serene way imaginable.
 In a sense, perhaps Amonas was indeed sleeping.
 A pang of fear gripped Hilderich's heart at the thought of Amonas never
 waking up again, but it passed quickly.
 In this maze of wonders where every step brought into view unimaginable
 marvels, surely even such a strange affliction as the one that had struck
 Amonas so suddenly could be treated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Prosops made a sound as if clearing a throat that could not have possibly
 existed for the intended purpose.
 The inclination of his body coupled with the strange tone of its voice
 somehow led Hilderich to believe it was trying to mimic a haughty, stiff
 manservant of a noble:

The Prosops bobbed frantically for a moment as if nodding wildly, seeking
 approval or acknowledgement, the red light in the black band in its middle
 moving up and down erratically.
 Hilderich looked unable to follow the meaning behind the machine's expression.
 He simply frowned slightly and proceeded towards the arched gate with the
 machine almost grudgingly trudging along behind Hilderich with Amonas'
 body somehow in tow, with no chain or rope between them, hovering a few
 inches above the granite floor.
 Its voice sounded disheartened, almost morose:

The Prosops shone a green beam of light onto the door and not a moment later,
 it started to grind itself open, squealing and making stressful noises.
 The process proved to be laborious and quite inefficient, unlike almost
 everything else around the Centron.
 Hilderich thought about that momentarily and made a mental note to inquire
 about it when it would seem appropriate.
 As if the machine could read his mind, it told him without being asked:

The machine ushered Hilderich inside with a gentle swaying of its mass and

 Hilderich nodded in acknowledgement, despite the silly pomp and ceremony

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The gates had opened to a bottleneck-shaped corridor, wide at the entrance
 and narrow at its end, where a dimly lit chamber could be seen.
 A slightly green and yellow light emanated from within, but few other details
 were visible from the distance.
 The corridor was luxuriously decorated with exquisitely carved panels of
 many different techniques and materials, depicting strange scenes that
 he failed to identify, even though he had an arguably extensive knowledge
 of history, myth and lore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The floor seemed to be made of the same granite as the doorsteps outside.
 It was tiled, alternating between lighter and darker tiles of red in a
 checkerboard pattern.
 Hilderich felt curiously intrigued by the improbably styled interior of
 the tower, though it troubled him that the atmosphere this place exuded
 was not akin to a place of healing.
 Suspicion bloomed inside him, but he took a first step towards the chamber
 nonetheless.

 He stopped dead in his tracks and slowly turned around to look at the Prosops

 The egg-shaped machine bobbed and leaned slightly forward, its black band
 adorned with a single red dot of light, it's voice low with faint undertones
 of mirth:

Exasperation did not suit Hilderich's face well but it was contorted in

 He still found it difficult to understand how eccentric a machine of such
 awesome power could be, resolving to ignore most of what it said from then
 onwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

He walked down the corridor with a true visitor's pace, slowly and deliberately.
 Hilderich felt his unwanted role to be almost enjoyable.
 He was intently staring at the intricate designs on the walls, trying to
 decipher the scenes they depicted.
 It was not because he felt his role demanded it so, but because his interest
 was genuinely piqued.
 A vague sense of importance seemed to radiate from these walls.
 A moment passed while Hilderich thought it strange that despite everything
 that he had seen so far, nothing seemed to have caught his stare in such
 a profound and intimate way.
 He paused in his stride while the Prosops seemed to follow silently, Amonas
 carried along behind him.
 He then asked the machine:

The machine did so, while Hilderich followed suit.
 A quick glance at Amonas unnerved him, the man's face serene as if it had
 surrendered to death, but brightly and vividly colored as if blood flowed
 hot in his veins still.
 He could not know the manner in which such a contradiction was achieved.
 He only hoped Amonas was indeed alive, and he had not been deceived by
 the capricious machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The long corridor ended in a resplendently adorned entrance to a well-lit
 chamber that seemed to resemble a richly decorated study, complete with
 bookcases and screens.
 A plush red and green carpet seemed to add a sense of decorum to the room,
 which overall seemed to exude a certain air of gravitas, possibly more
 than what Hilderich found tasteful.
 It was octagonal in shape, each side playing host to an assortment of bookcases
 and glass screens, filled with seemingly pristine books of various sizes,
 accompanied by many objects that were possibly more than mere decorations.
 Everything was neatly arranged and the room was purposefully designed with
 elegance and style, a feel for the finer things in life.
 Velvet could be found in many surfaces, as well as glistening marble, bronze,
 gold and copper in fine casings and perfect symmetry of space.
 It was the room of a noble connoisseur, a man of wealth and taste.
 It felt completely out of place in the Centron, and the slightly bobbing
 form of the Prosops inside struck Hilderich as almost vulgar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hilderich could not believe he had not seen it the moment he stepped inside,
 indeed he cursed himself silently for not seeing it as he had walked down
 the length of the corridor.
 From the roof of the large room hang a large metal assemblage, angular
 and bulky, almost orthogonal in shape.

\begin_layout Standard

Whatever it was, it had almost definitely been placed in this room as an
 afterthought, as no sane person would knowingly add such a monstrosity
 to a carefully arranged interior environment.
 However long Hilderich stared at it in utter disbelief and profound distaste,
 words would not escape his gaping mouth and the atrocious piece of metal
 would not go away.
 The Prosops said with a knowledgeable tone of voice that somehow also managed
 to express ennui, its languid movements undoubtedly adding to that effect:

Hilderich indulged the machine, taking a couple of steps back absent-mindedly
 while at the same time his head was turned upwards, his stare fixed on
 the unbelievably ugly and misplaced metal object which seemed to be the
 size of a large wardrobe or closet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Within moments, the large bulk of metal started to lower itself in a rapid,
 fluid motion, coming to rest on the carpet.
 It was indeed roughly shaped like a large wardrobe, its metal surface painted
 a matte drab olive green.
 Large tubes and fat strands of what looked like colored rope to Hilderich
 seemed to protrude from its very top, while a low humming noise was faintly
 audible.
 The Prosops tugged Amonas behind him with some sluggishness, as if it were
 reluctant to do so.
 It flicked a beam of light at the closet and suddenly a door large enough
 for a man of almost any size to stand upright slid open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich was transfixed to where he stood, his gaze wandering around the
 metal contraption, the open door and the Prosops.
 A primal fear roused him to reality with a jolt, bringing him back to his
 senses.
 He realized cold sweat was running down his back and forehead, while at
 the same time he shouted at the machine which was lifting Amonas upright:

The Prosops lifted itself slightly upward before slowly turning its black
 band to face Hilderich.
 Though it had little in the way of communicating sentiment and feeling
 and lacked a facial expression, the flatly lit red thick line in the middle
 of the black band felt to Hilderich almost as if it wanted to burn through
 him with enjoyable deliberation.
 The stiffness of the machine's movements somehow struck him as portraying
 extreme exasperation, a feeling which was indeed verified when the machine
 spoke, tones of outright annoyance in its vaguely male voice:

 I could just sit there and tell you I'm already doing it, too fast for

He thought the machine was genuinely frustrated by now, something that he
 would have never thought possible of a machine.
 It was rather apparent though that it was largely dissatisfied and had
 lost its good humor, quite possibly a long time ago.
 Hilderich was reluctant to demand more of the machine right at that time
 but he felt he had to ask, even though he might not understand.
 He did so politely, trying to appease the machine's brooding mood, his
 voice trimmed and clipped to something an ambassador would use to convey
 assurance and calm:

 I've never met such a charismatic personality such as yours.
 It has been quite an adventure so far in the Centron and it's no small
 wonder that it's all under your control.
 I would be utterly grateful if you would be so kind as to offer your expert
 assistance to my friend right there.
 I would also be honored if you could explain some of the delicate techniques

The Prosops bobbed slightly leaning to and fro as well, as if it were intrigued
 and curiously undecided about what it should say.
 The red dot of light that flitted on its black glass-like band had turned
 into a blurry glow.
 One could even surmise the machine was trying to look blushed.
 Despite the unhappy circumstances and their precarious situation, Hilderich
 barely managed to suppress an oncoming fit of the giggles.
 He was looking at the machine with a feigned look of worried expectation,
 when it answered with a sparkling quality in its voice:

Amonas then moved in the air, his body still enclosed in the same strange
 aura as it had been before while being ferried to this place.
 The machine assumed a more formal voice with an intense feeling of feigned

 Hilderich's ears it only managed to sound like a dimwitted inflated egotist:

Hilderich's face was creased in a show of anxious concern.
 He had no idea what the machine was talking about, but it seemed to at
 least seem to know what it was doing.
 He was now standing closer to the metallic closet; the immersion tank,
 as the Prosops had called it.
 The rigidly held upright body of Amonas was expressionless, frigid in more
 than one way.
 Hilderich felt it would somehow be his fault if anything went wrong.
 Even though it was Amonas who had dragged him into all this mess, he felt
 it was him all along that had guided him and kept him alive in order to
 untangle the strands of fate that had led them to the Centron.
 He thought that it had seemed to be going rather well so far, considering.
 Hilderich could not know what the problem with Amonas was exactly, or whether
 the cure the machine would attempt was in any way dangerous or painful.
 He asked it anyway, knowing that the answer would be irrelevant at this
 point, but it seemed to matter to him:

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich nodded awkwardly, while at the same time he did something he had
 never thought about in such a fundamental, vividly profound and genuine
 way: he prayed.
 Hilderich prayed for Amonas to any and all Gods, forces of nature, or beings
 of power, whatever one might have called them.
 As a last resort, feeling it was the only thing he could do, powerless
 to act and indeed depended on an erratic, capricious and strange machine,
 he prayed to any and all that would heed his prayers.
 He prayed to no one in particular, replacing the words in his mind with
 thoughts and feelings.
 He could hear the echo of his one voiced thought though: `Please'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The door slid back into a closed position and then it suddenly turned transparen
t, as if a veil had been lifted.
 Amonas' form was clearly visible as a greenish liquid that closely resembled
 sewer slime started to fill the tank and rising slowly.
 The liquid was somewhat transparent but not entirely, offering a hazy view
 of the body it engulfed, shadowy and murky.
 The aura the Prosops had encapsulated Amonas within started to dissipate
 in tune with the climbing level of the liquid, letting it carry Amonas'
 weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich grimaced with distaste at the sight of the greenish liquid, an
 expression to which the machine answered with a derisive comment wholly
 intended for Hilderich's ears:

Hilderich simply peered at the metal egg-shaped machine without saying a
 word, more worried about Amonas' fate than for the machine's personal opinion
 of himself.
 It rarely mattered to him when people expressed it, much less when a machine
 did so.
 He knew his smell was less than agreeable but that was understandable after
 going on for more than a week without bathing.
 In any case, he couldn't care less; just as long as that didn't stop the
 machine from performing its ministrations on Amonas, he'd have time for
 a bath sometime later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As he sat there watching the liquid rise hazily, Hilderich saw it would
 not stop at his chin, or even at his mouth.
 He instinctively yelled at the machine and went for the transparent closet,
 trying to find a knob or handle to no avail:

The liquid was quickly filling up the entire tank, and Hilderich was manically
 trying to open the door.
 He started to pound on it with his palms and fists with no other effect
 than a dull thudding noise.
 The liquid filled the tank entirely, and Amonas was serenely bobbing inside
 it, indistinguishable from a drowned man.
 Hilderich was shocked in silence with his mouth stunned open.
 The machine then walked close by him, his voice surprisingly calm:

Indeed, tiny bubbles were rising from Amonas nose, steadily climbing up
 through the liquid, some of them seemingly trapped in the angles of his
 nose, some even clinging to his hair.
 He looked as serene as ever, slightly alien and even menacing under the
 greenish hues of the liquid, his full form unclear, slightly occluded within
 the depth of the tank as his body floated freely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Then, the other door pane turned transparent and the same greenish hue was
 emitted from within.
 Hilderich took a step back, his interest piqued and his fears quietened
 for now.
 He felt indeed inexorably drawn to see the form of the Sleeping Man, someone
 who seemed so important, so integral to the workings of such an awe-inspiring
 place, a place where almost anything felt possible.
 Perhaps this was indeed the man he had been looking for, the man with the
 answers to all the questions Hilderich could conceive of and more.
 He felt it would be an honor, a majestic moment to look upon his true form,
 a man of legend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
What he saw though made his hair stand up and his skin crawl, his body tremble
 in sheer physical shock:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Behind the depths of the green liquid, inside the tank, all he could see
 was a spinal cord attached to a peculiar-looking brain, silver hair-thick
 fibers jutting from underneath, locked together and tightly connected to
 some sort of flexible tube.
 The hideous abomination was floating gruesomely in the liquid; a horrific,
 ghastly view that caused Hilderich to almost vomit in disgust.
 The sight was nightmarish.
 Hilderich tried to force it out of his mind, but the horrible image kept
 flashing in his head like it had now been etched in his mind forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He tried to concentrate on something familiar, something dear and important
 to him.
 He thought of Amonas and the image in his head devolved to a child, someone
 he had once known as a brother.
 The unbidden thought surprised him with its temerity; he thought he had
 cast out the memory of that boy long ago, but it seemed that it had lingered
 in his very soul for all those many years.
 Strangely, he found the memory of him comforting now.
 Once the initial feeling of shock had dissipated, Hilderich mustered every
 iota of self-control to keep himself from screaming the question through
 gritting teeth, his fists clenched in tension:

The machine bobbed slightly, wavered a little about its oval base.
 It seemed confused, as if perplexed at the sudden change in Hilderich's

 The form of Amonas was a stark contrast against the abominable freakish

 The transparent door of the tank containing the abhorrence turned opaque
 once more, an oblique barrier between it and one's sanity.
 It resolved to speak in what sounded to Hilderich like a solemn voice:

Hilderich found the machine's view somehow enlightening, though indeed blase
 and disturbing.
 It implied people were fools to believe in their soul.
 It occurred to him that it made sense, that a thing without a soul indeed
 smart enough to make assumptions and generate ideas of its own, would arrive
 at such a conclusion.
 It was a very interesting philosophical matter that Hilderich would have
 loved to discuss about, but it was neither the time nor the place for such
 a discussion.
 He simply nodded then and answered vaguely, still holding on the facade

 For those of you new to the Shellworld A34B, or more commonly named as
 Nody's Claim, I welcome you to Game Consortium's Station Lilith.
 As you can see from the holographic projection and the data array attached,
 in case you were asleep during your transition..
 we are orbiting the binary star widely known as Behenii-1 in most tourist
 star maps, also known to some of you colloquially as Persebs or Binary
 888.
 For complete reference you should check the standard data array emitted.
 The Shellworld A34B like most shellworlds, is a unique mega-construction.
 It encapsulates the smallest of the three stars, providing a large number
 and variety of gaming resort world panels, with varied climates and atmospheres
 to accomodate any and all game setups.
 Active attitude mechanisms are in place to create a high degree of available
 customization.
 Also notable is one of the unique ways the shellworld is kept in one piece,
 using actively maintained mass-driven momentum devices in a huge network
 that completely covers the inner surface.
 I take some measure of pride in being in active control of the mechanism,
 which though quite ancient and indeed of great xenoarchaelogical interest,
 rest assured is quite safe and sound in all aspects of its operation.

Hilderich's mind was reeling from shock.
 His face remained frozen in an almost expressionless state, as if he was
 absent-minded or hard at thinking.
 But in truth, he was suddenly terrified at the immensity of the revelation.
 That was what the bullhorns had been.
 And the lone sun.
 Their own, twin suns..
 A construct? Their world, was a construct? A fabrication? It seemed as
 if it was a lie, yet he knew it not to be.
 He had seen the one sun, he had walked on the lush hot forests of the inner
 shell.
 He had grown up near a lake under the light of the twin suns.
 The blue and yellow, easily distinguished as two suns in the winter, and
 every other dusk their colors rang true.
 So this was the truth.
 Perhaps the ultimate truth.
 What more could there be, what was more important than this? A discovery
 that would change everything.
 Their world was constructed by someone it seemed, at some distant point
 in time.
 And it was being used as a sideshow, a gaming resort? That was something
 he had not completely understood, and could not for a while longer, until
 his mind found some peace to try and come to grips with this new, world-shatter

It no longer was a figure of speech, but suddenly it had acquired an inescapable

 It held both the fate of Amonas and the world in its hand.
 It was absurd.
 Utterly absurd to the point of bringing tears of laughter to Hilderich,
 who simply could not cope with all that in any way.
 So he simply laughed despite himself, trying to fit in his head something
 that would boggle down the entire Curatoria.
 The machine looked at him quizzically, as if it found the man equally weird
 and intriguing.
 Hilderich half-heard it through his nervous fit of laughter, while he kept
 pointing at the star chart though nowhere in particular:

What the machine had just said made no sense at all to Hilderich, but he
 was anyway preoccupied with trying to ingest what it had all implied.
 He had to learn more; he could only think of the time they had lost preaching
 to themselves about Gods, trying to remain pious, while all this time they
 could have found out.
 Master Olom had literally devoted his life to this cause.
 It was finally making sense, it was finally worth the effort.

He felt tears running down his cheeks, but he couldn't know whether it was
 from the laughter or the pure and simple joy of finally uncovering what
 even his master could not have imagined.
 The whole world was an ancient piece of technology.
 But, where had they come from? What where their myths and legends for?
 What part of it was true and what was not? He had to return to Pyr now,
 seek the Curatoria.
 Muster enough evidence from this place to finally convince them.
 Organize an expedition.
 Surely now they would listen?

He could still hear himself laughing, imagining the look on their faces
 would have been such a treat for master Olom.
 Perhaps even the boy would rejoice, but after so many years who knew what
 had happened to him? Last he heard, his master had been murdered and no
 other word of him had reached him.
 It was uncanny at how the thought of him had appeared in his mind at this
 most unlikely of hours.
 Suddenly he heard a strange sound like a whining coming from the Prosops,
 which broke his laughter and reverie with an alarming alacrity.
 The machine seemed to be encountering some difficulty, bobbing up and down
 erratically, frantically rotating and skewing its body as if it was trying
 to free itself of invisible leashes, it's voice crackling with a slow and
 heavy stutter as if it had been somehow damaged:

Hilderich wasn't aware what it meant but he believed that the term `organic'

 could not be good at all.
 He felt way in above his head and unfortunately it was true.
 If the machine could not contain its shock, he should be utterly afraid

 He asked the Prosops, real fear creeping up in his voice, his instincts
 waking up to realise the intensity of a completely unknown situation.

 When Hilderich did not answer, the machine went on, this time physically

I've got little reason to believe you, but there were other simpler ways

 Logic says you either don't want to, didn't know how to, or perhaps both.
 In any case, and because you seem okay as far as primitive humanoids go,
 I think you're telling me the truth.
 Which only complicates things.
 To put it in terms you might understand, there was a trap in your friend's
 mind, something that can only be placed there with extreme manipulation
 of the brain at the neuron level, or in a very crude form by simpler techniques
 like hypnosis or through the use of specific substances.
 How it got there's just strange, but doesn't seem important right now.
 What happened was, when I tried to reroute your friend's neurons to bypass
 the problem area that had blocked his prime functions, making him pretty

Hilderich shook his head left and right to indicate he hadn't a clue.
 His mind was trying to absorb what the Prosops was telling him.
 A trap? Inside Amonas' mind? How could that be? Hilderich's eye caught
 some strange activity from behind the machine, but his entire mind was
 focused on what the machine was saying, never really registering what was
 going on in the tank.
 The machine seemed to sag in mid-air but continued in its previous rhythm,
 its voice unstoppable:

Never mind, it seems you don't.
 When the trap went off, it took me by surprise; the various defenses and
 built-in mechanisms failed to contain a series of pre-programmed attacks,
 attacks which could only have been devised by someone intimately familiar
 with my structure and design.
 In the confusion and in my panic to protect as much of me as possible,
 I started shedding control subsystems, disconnecting them.
 Think of it as chopping my own arms off trying to avoid a disease spreading
 to my heart and killing me, okay? Now, in that processing I seem to have
 irreversibly placed as much of my conscience and intelligent functions
 in this scrap of metal, the avatar, the Prosops.
 I got nothing else than this piece of metal and the anti-grav unit to go
 about.
 No field effectors, no transient resonance capacity, nothing.
 Not even data feeds.
 Like I said, I'm dead, dumb and blind.
 The control functions seem to have been neurally linked with that guy in

 And in the process I might have let other stuff seep through.

Amonas had a trap set inside his mind? Who planted it there then? And when

 A curious sound was heard then, like the muffled splash of water and a

Hilderich was the first to notice, even as he was still trying to make more
 sense of what the machine had been saying.
 They were both facing each other, and none of them had a clear view of
 the tank, the machine's black band facing Hilderich.
 When Hilderich asked the machine what it had meant by saying the other
 guy had seeped through, it was not the voice of the machine that answered
 him, but the eerily familiar voice of Amonas.
 Its tone though was preternaturally odd and radiated a sickly wrong feeling:

 The man in front of them looked like Amonas, but his eyes were not the
 pale blue of the kind, persevering, faithful man that was Amonas.
 They were a baleful force, two blue sparks of malevolence.
 It all looked utterly wrong, but it was irrevocably real.
 This was not Amonas.

Your point of view depends on where you stand when you look at everything.
 That's a universal truth, one of the few that appears to not be ephemeral,

 From my point of view, Amonas is dead and gone, his conscience and reason
 wholly erased; replaced with my mind, my mental state, me.
 The real me.
 Only his body remains, but that too, is now mine.
 I must have looked hideous in my former state, isn't that right Hilderich?
 Is that not what you thought when you laid eyes upon my biological remains?
 No, I cannot read minds although I usually see right through people's thoughts.
 You are so easy to read, especially humans in this world.
 I would have opted for storage in a computer matrix or an aether device,
 but I am so hedonistic, I must admit, that I cannot live without the immediacy
 of the flesh, the senses from billions of nerve receptors flooding my mind.
 Some consider it crude, ineffectual, a poor choice of style.

 With eyes wide from the shock of unimaginable despair he lay there, slightly

 As his sight was fixed on the face of a man he had loved as a friend, tears

 He had seen a friend transformed unwillingly into a beast of many faces,

The logical error counter maximum is 127.
 Given that each of these loonies seem to have been visiting regularly each
 12 system standard years, that would give an approximate estimate of reseeding
 every 1524 system standard years.
 1524 times nine is 13716 system standard years.
 That would mean the next counter reset increment is due this year.

That's right, you worthless piece of machinery.
 That's why I had to step up things from my side lately.

 See your face.

I had made a backwards turn: I thought about spinning the spindle the other
 way around.
 I led things this tenth time a little different than the others.
 I created a society of people who were devoted believers, not so much bent
 on destruction and killing in the name of their gods, but obedient, unremarkabl
e, and so predictable.
 Still I nurtured them with a festering indignation, something that I tended
 to exacerbate from time to time.
 Uprisings, little revolts, small riots.
 Something to remind the more daring souls that they were being oppressed,
 hunted down, that their lives used as oil for a ruthless machine.
 I also instituted the Curatoria.
 A lovely little organization of mumbling idiots that believed they were
 so much different from the rest, so much better, so scholarly and knowledgeable.
 I fed them with trinkets and treasures past from civilizations that had
 gone extinct in my fruitless attempt to win this frigging game.
 And lo and behold, I began to see the fruits of my labor and the error
 of my ways.
 My pawns had actually done something useful with their pathetic lives.
 I learned of the northern continent, a myth I had notched up as folk tales
 and the ravings of mad men.
 And when I saw the girl, that dark skinned girl that Umberth had found,
 I knew it was something of his making.
 The dark skin, his own skin.
 At least that was his starting profile from what I knew.
 Such a hypocrite! I knew he was fumbling with the Centron somehow, seeing
 someone carrying his mark around the game board as if nothing was amiss,
 the game still running, the timer not yet reset.
 It troubled me for an endless amount of time, during which I spent long
 years trying to figure the exact way in which he had wrenched the Centron's
 gears.
 I found about it only when that servant wrote down his telling story of
 the mysterious northern tribe.
 Without knowing, the consistent writing down of their customs and rituals
 led me to identify them as his own creations, as well as calculate the
 period of their visits, or pilgrimages as they call them to the Centron,
 all from a single reference.
 I knew then that there was something very specific about the number 128;
 everything always happened on the 128th peregrination.
 Always.
 Musing about the workings of the game I remembered the seed and how pivotal
 it's role actually is: the rules of the game clearly state that `in the
 highly improbable case of technical error, the current game ends in a draw
 and is reseeded to allow the players a fair second chance at winning'.
 In the words of the technologists of a long lost civilization, I'd found
 a bug.
 And then all I had to do was exploit it.
 That's where you and your most accommodating friend come in the picture,
 Hilderich.

 It had taken a lifetime for Hilderich to find this place but it now seemed
 it would take more than whatever life he had left to live to even understand

 He loathed the man intensely but could do nothing to stop himself from
 wanting to listen to what had happened up until then.
 Agrippa had a reassuring smile casually worn on his face, as if congratulating

I read your master's work Hilderich.
 He seemed a genuinely smart person, for someone in the Curatoria.
 His suspicions were mostly correct, but as you have seen, not in any way
 he could have imagined.
 Based on these suspicions, I laid out a trap of my own.
 What you've come to know as keystones themselves are not special in a particula
r way.
 They are indeed merely free give-away gifts for the spectators.
 Indeed, what you and your master held in such high esteem as artifacts
 of a long lost civilization are nothing more than the detritus of a certain
 kind of people in the developed universe that are filled with ennui, and
 find such games on shellworlds a welcome diversion.
 Some even pay to watch live, not from the Centron, but from the game-board
 itself.
 Yes, off-worlders have roamed about your world, filling it with with their
 junk, which you Curators then mistook for important.
 In a sense, to you, their importance remains unchallenged.
 That keystone your master had in his care, that was a keystone I had personally
 entrusted to him, a ticket for a way in.
 Don't act so surprised, Hilderich.
 Perhaps, you're wondering by now, why he hadn't used it himself? Why hadn't
 he tried to at least? Why did he rarely ever speak of it himself? What
 is it that made him tick, Hilderich? Tell me, Hilderich, what do you remember
 of your earliest years, the time you were a toddler?

Hilderich's unease and suspicion grew exponentially.
 How deep was this thing's scheme that it extended to master Olom? Why did
 he ask him such irrelevant questions at this hour? Was he belatedly or
 mockingly trying to befriend him? He chose silence over expressing his
 ire frivolously.
 There would be ample time for that when nothing else could be done.
 Secretly, without even admitting it to himself, he believed that time was
 approaching fast now.
 Agrippa went on, once more assuming the role of the man with all the answers.
 If nothing more, Hilderich had found whomever he had set out to, the man
 his master had not dared to.
 Agrippa spoke in the gruff undertones of Amonas, this time almost true
 to his original timbre:

 Olom was not always the quietly wizened old man he looked like when he

 He was good at what he intended to devote his life to.

So I approached him, I appealed to his darker side; the less illustrious

 I tempted him with forbidden knowledge, offered him artifacts and trinkets

 At first, he had actually believed he had my unremitting support and help
 so he could achieve a victory of sorts against the dark forces that sought
 man's eternal struggle.
 I presented myself as a reformer, a bright spiritual leader unlike the

I promised him the dawning of a new era, with him uncovering the secrets

 I took great joy in that role, but the best part was when I forced him

 When I sent away his daughter, when I smeared his name forever, when I
 made her loathe him.
 When I told him that should anything happen to you, his daughter's life
 would be forfeit, he became a most willing subject.
 He knew that there would come a time he'd have to give his own life to
 save his daughter.
 Do you remember that night Hilderich?

You might be wondering why he had to protect you from myself.
 Perhaps it was because he knew you were expendable, but his daughter was

 I had to plan some contingencies.
 The Waking Man gave me the idea, I must admit.
 Olom did raise you indeed like a bastard son, I'll give him that.
 What's the matter, why are you crying? It's alright Hilderich, you can
 call me father if you like.

 Because he believed such knowledge could change a hard, deceitful, uncaring

 I believe his mind was somehow programmed to lead this man into the hands

He dug a shallow grave, his hands unable to dig deeper into the wet sand
 far below.
 He thought that it would have to do.
 He covered him with the sand, and prayed that his soul would receive whatever
 it was due, whether it be punishment or praise.
 He was now in the hands of God, and that was the Pilgrim's sole consolation
 in the matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He set out once again to reach the Forge of Stones, to end his pilgrimage
 and fulfill his mission and duties.
 He had one more reason now, and that was his brother's death at the hands
 of the archenemy's servant.
 He had known the danger's that lay even in the Land of God.
 It was his duty to protect his care-free brother, and he had failed.
 He was not overcome with grief, but with righteous fury.
 If God willed it so, he would be ready to dispense his wrath to the minions
 of the archenemy.
 By blade, hand or prayer, he would shatter them like ice in the spring,
 that much and nothing less the oath on his brother's grave demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim walked in solitude, the sand and wind as ever his companions.
 The Land of God was silent around him, but it spoke to his very soul, demanding
 vengeance to be exacted.
 He trudged along over the sand unyielding, tenaciously leaving footmarks
 behind him only to be swept away by the desert breeze, slowly but surely.
 He lost track of time, never once looking up to the suns, their ride across
 the sky unimportant to him when his purpose was clearly visible in front
 of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As if they had not been there before to notice, he suddenly reached the
 high walls of the Garden that stretched in front of him as far as his eyes
 could see.
 He could see the spirals that tempted the dominion of the sky, the arches
 that rose as if in solemn prayer to God, and the Holy Gate beyond which
 his purpose lay.
 It had been a moment of excited relief for him.
 He remembered the preachings of the elders, and the Pilgrim who had come
 before him, and did as they had done; as so many others had done before
 them all, for innumerable springs and endless winters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He touched the Gate uttering the mantra of God, making His sign and kneeling
 down as the rites required of him.
 But it was no mere tradition, he could see.
 God was there with him, alongside him, dousing him with lights of many
 colors.
 He listened to an answer to his incantations in the tongue of God, the
 sacred tongue that none of his people ever uttered, and never would lest
 they defile Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Gate opened to allow him inside the Garden.
 In wonder and astonishment he saw the Chariot of God fly from the depths
 below and rise to meet him without a sound, in perfect grace and harmony.
 Tears of rapture ran down his cheeks while he praised his God and Lord,
 the deliverer of his people, Father to them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Chariot moved with the speed of the wind and what he saw filled him
 with overpowering awe.
 The glory and majesty that the workings of his God radiated was an ineffable
 sight.
 He saw the beauty and he marveled at the size of it all.
 Through darkness came God's light, through nothingness and chaos came shape
 and sight.
 His face shone from the light of God's angels, performing their appointed
 tasks with harmony, diligence and piety.
 It was a sight that made him feel his life could not end until he had himself
 told of his pilgrimage to the next in line.
 He now understood why the pilgrimage mattered so to his people: He knew
 it was not for fear of losing the sacred stones, and the heat and light
 that shone with him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
These were God's gifts, which he freely gave and could freely take away.
 But his greatest gift was his Garden, his Garden of wonders with which
 he filled a man's soul with indomitable will and unbreakable spirit.
 What the Pilgrim felt could not be compared to any emotion he had experienced
 before.
 It was not pride, it was not honor.
 It was neither fervor or awe, or anything like that combined.
 It was love.
 The Garden filled a man's soul with love, the love of God, the love of
 his people, so they may endure and live on to worship his name.
 `Glory be to God!' shouted the Pilgrim while the Chariot carried him aloft
 now, passing over all of God's wonders and heading to the heart of the
 Forge, where his pilgrimage would end and he would be given the honor of
 bringing back the Holy Stone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He saw now that the Chariot was leading him to a tower that reached into
 the very ceiling itself, both ends lost in the interminable darkness above
 and below.
 Suddenly, the Chariot was dipping sharply below while he comfortably sat
 within, as if the invisible hand of God held him safely in place without
 fear of him ever falling off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
In a matter of moments, the Chariot came serenely to a stop, having brought
 him in front of a remarkable work of marble.
 It was delicate and exquisite, holy in its magnificence, adorned with the
 grace of God who surely must have wrought it himself.
 He knelt, bowing low so as to have his head touch the marble steps laid
 out before him, never speaking but simply offering his silent prayers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The doors to the heart of the Forge were open.
 He could see a long corridor leading to a well-lit room, surely the Sacred
 Chamber.
 He could see little of the signs and markings that he had been told to
 expect, but he was safe in the knowledge that his God was leading his way,
 his angels all around him, his Chariot bringing him to the place God had
 ordained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He passed under the arched doorway and made the sign of God.
 What he saw though unnerved him: the walls were made of wood and were embellish
ed with monstrous carvings.
 Hideous forms seemed to leap at him, visions of demons jutting from every
 side.
 This was blasphemy! This was the work of the archenemy! It was clear as
 ice to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The thought came unbidden to his mind, springing up from the well of his
 soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
`This is the work of evil, and it shall burn.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He could now hear a coarse voice, rising and falling like the tide.
 It was strident and harsh.
 It was the voice of a beast rather than the voice of a man.
 He rushed through the corridor, a prayer on his mouth and the shattered
 blade on his hand, ready to taste the blood of demons.
 Other sounds could be heard as well.
 He could hear other voices as he turned his brisk walk into a jog, a kind
 of struggling sound and a dull thud, not much unlike the sound of rock
 upon rock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As the light grew more intense, his sight adjusted and he could see more
 clearly inside the room in front of him.
 He could see a demon of metal thrust against a wall and two men grappling,
 embraced in a vicious fight.
 What he saw filled him with fury, wrath, and the grace of God filled him
 with strength he had never felt before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He saw the archenemy, trying to take the life of his brother whom he had
 buried himself in the sands.
 Though he seemed to be dressed in different clothes, he was alive and breathing
! As if God had performed a miracle, his brother was fighting the archenemy.
 It was their destiny it seemed to bring him down forever.
 They had been chosen, and his brother was given life anew.
 He knew what he had to do now, his purpose clear as daylight.
 He ran as if a river of fire was fast behind his heels, and he could have
 sworn he could hear the voice of God urging him to avenge all the lives
 the beast before him had claimed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
He lunged with terrible might and purpose at the human form of the beast
 which could not fool a man of God.
 It seemed to have paid him no notice but his brother had somehow known,
 and had made a small step just in time for the Pilgrim's blade to run the
 beast through and through its heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The beast was stunned in silence; its face became a mask of pain and horror,
 utter disbelief in the deep blue of its eyes.
 It wore a man's visage, a face that might have looked beautiful, even honorable
 if it had belonged to a brother.
 It was the face of a deceiver though and its life was now seeping away,
 its grasp on the Pilgrim's brother fading quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The archenemy collapsed on his feet, his eyes rolling backwards with only
 the white of his eyes visible.
 The Pilgrim had never thought he would be chosen to kill the archenemy,
 if that was what had happened.
 He had never even heard the wise elders mention such a thing.
 He just was; the archenemy simply existed to oppose God.
 Had he made an error? Was this not God's will? He listened to his thoughts
 and was confounded.
 He followed the elders' advice and remained true to his heart.
 He saw the archenemy before him, and killed him with one swift blow.
 He had not thought it possible, but God had allowed it.
 Indeed, perhaps God had led him here to confront his nemesis.
 It was why he had resurrected his brother, that's all the Pilgrim could
 think of.
 It might have been a hubris, but perhaps he was after all God's chosen
 champion.
 Perhaps the appointed hour had come.
 It had all happened so soon, merely moments had passed and it had all ended.
 He looked about him with a frightened expression of horror, shock and surprise
 on his brother's face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Then he saw the demon of metal, which seemed to exist still despite its
 master's demise.
 His body tensed and tried to lunge at him, but his brother threw his hands
 at him and constrained him, shouting in his strange mother tongue, like
 when they had first met on the Path.
 As he was about to push him away, their eyes met, and he could see something
 flashing inside them.
 His hands went slack and he dropped his blade.
 He remembered the teachings: `At the appointed hour blood will be spilled,
 and tears will be shed.
 Weep no more, for the end will be nigh.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Pilgrim looked slackly at his brother.
 He made a motion with his hands to the Pilgrim to calm him down and make
 him sit.
 He pointed at the demon which seemed to be somehow in league with his brother,
 an unlikely ally or a renegade perhaps, he could not be sure.
 It looked as if it did not intend them any harm.
 That too, must have been God's work he thought, and left it at that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Suddenly while his brother kept repeating questions the Pilgrim could not
 understand, everything around them started trembling.
 Things fell from the wooden walls and crystal glass shattered.
 He could feel the rumble of the earth deep inside him, he could hear its
 death throes.
 The world was going to end, he knew.
 It had been the last Pilgrimage.
 Tears ran down his throat and cheeks, and a loud prayer formed on his lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The metal demon and his brother were frantically exchanging words.
 Fear had taken over them, the fear of death.
 They were trying to make him move, take him with them wherever they planned
 to escape.
 He shook his head rigorously, refusing such petty dishonor.
 They did not seem to understand there was no escape.
 He would finally meet God, having offered him as much of his life in service
 as he could.
 He would meet his father, and tell him of the last Pilgrimage.
 He would meet every soul of his people in the heavens, and tell them of
 his tale: tell them about the Forge of Stones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
As the earth shook with even more violence, pieces of the room around him
 started to fall off their place as if an invisible being of terrible might
 was picking them apart.
 In the distance he could see the demon and his brother running aimlessly
 out the corridor, trying vainly to save their lives, perhaps their souls
 too, if the demon had any.
 He shouted words of parting to his brother for whom God seemed to have
 many other wondrous plans:

As everything went dark right before it all finally crumbled on top of him,
 he saw the young man turn his head in his direction and shout something.
 It sounded like something his brother had told him in the desert.
 With the last of his breathes, and nothing but a numbing feel running down
 his spine to remind him he was barely alive, he tried to say the words
 himself:

 interior of the ship felt like a mansion: fine tapestries lined the wooden
 walls and thick handwoven carpets adorned the floors.
 Most of it was decorated in the same fashion, with the engines and the
 assorted support mechanisms and infrastructure taking up little space.
 According to the Prosops it was a refurbished luxury yacht.
 The whole den back on the Centron had actually been a shipyard, something
 of a hobby the Centron had taken up to spent his endless time and unlimited
 resources, acute intelligence and insurmountable flair.
 The fact that a mere hobby could reach such a scale was mindboggling to
 Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Even though Hilderich could not have known what other ships similar to this
 one looked like, he felt impressed by the taste the machine had shown,
 and genuinely believed it to be a fine ship, even though the Prosops had
 insisted on him using the term `astrogational vehicle'.
 Hilderich had ignored the machine profoundly on that matter and kept calling
 the ship, `ship'.
 He had warmed up on the machine's name though, and now called it as it
 had preferred to refer to itself: Ron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Celia had kept mostly to herself and the child ever since they found her
 on the Waking Man's capsule.
 Ron had been evidently surprised to find out how she came about a player
 capsule.
 When they roused her from her stasis sleep, she was at first shocked and
 terrified, frightened of her child.
 But Hilderich managed to explain to her what had happened, though she wasn't
 sure how she had come to be in the capsule, nor what the data slab contained.
 She wept openly when Hilderich told her of Amonas demise.
 Since then though, she rarely spoke and when she did it was merely to ask
 for some amenity or help.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The Prosops was a good host though it seemed to lack some real skill with
 handling people.
 Hilderich knew that unfortunately he was not very apt in that department
 either so he felt he was unable to help and comfort her in some meaningful
 way.
 Perhaps he felt responsible for Amonas, he couldn't tell.
 He had hoped he would have met her under very different situations, but
 fate had decided otherwise.
 Perhaps in time, her grief would subside and her spirits lift.
 As far as he could tell, she hadn't been as impressed by the sheer scale
 of the newly found cosmos unfolding before them, unlike himself who spent
 hours gazing at the projection screen of what amounded to the ship's bridge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich had been busy resting most of the time at first, but he did spend
 some time with the machine, which naturally saw to the daily routine of
 maintaining the ship, checking and plotting their course, as well as trying
 to update Hilderich on the workings of the universe and the general state
 of affairs in the civilized galaxy.
 It had never occurred to Hilderich that there could ever be more knowledge
 than he could ever hope to understand in millions of life-times, but he
 would sadly have to do with as much as he could manage in one life-time,
 which was quite a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ron had filled him in with as much detail as it could concerning the game,
 the shellworld and what had transpired according to what it now knew.
 He was shocked to find out there were literally thousands of shellworlds
 not very much different than his own, hosting games like the one that had
 been using everybody on his world as unwilling, unknowing pawns.
 What had really challenged his sanity though, was the sight of a world
 being destroyed.
 Celia could not bear witness, and she had remained in her quarters, tending
 to her lone child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
It was not something any one was supposed to ever witness in his life, and
 Hilderich had seen it happen in slow, aggravating detail, before finally
 averting his red sore eyes.
 At that moment he had decided to stop that from happening ever again, to
 the best of his ability.
 He had some new responsibilities now: himself, Celia and her child was
 everything that remained from their world.
 He would protect them now, not simply to honour Amonas' memory, but because
 he felt it was the most important thing he could salvage from the utter
 destruction of their world: hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
When he recovered from the shock, Hilderich contemplated the last moments
 in the Centron.
 After the strange man had appeared as if out of nowhere and killed Agrippa,
 everything had happened too fast to actually remember.
 Ron had filled him in, replaying a recording of the scene that had taken
 place.
 Once Agrippa died, there was nothing in the way of keeping the place running
 and everything happened with the speed of an avalanche, gathering incredible
 momentum with every passing moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Ron had explained to him how delicate the shellworld mechanism was and how
 it was structurally near-impossible to keep it one piece without the active
 mechanism of the bullhorns.
 Once that system had become inert, the gravitational forces, a natural
 phenomenon that Hilderich could not fully grasp yet, had torn the shell
 world apart within a few hours.
 They had barely escaped with their lives when they saw the world begin
 to shatter into fragments the size of mountain ranges and become a cloud
 of debris that within a few days time settled into a disk of detritus and
 dust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
Hilderich's mind frequently replayed the fight with Agrippa, trying to fathom
 who that dark-skinned man had been.
 He had tried to save the man from certain death, as Ron had indicated they
 had little more than a few minutes to escape but their strange savior would
 not come and Ron was forced to push Hilderich aside and keep shoving him
 almost all the way to the nearest ship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The machine took great pride in the fact that without his hobby they would
 be `dead meat', as it had said in its usually flamboyant manner.
 It had also agreed to help Hilderich on the quest he had vowed to undertake,
 since as it had said itself:

And so they were ploughing on the vastness of space, speeding away from
 the Binary 888.
 Ron was looking intently at a star chart, its black band of glass colored
 cyan, in a desperate attempt at trying to be, in its own words, 'rad',
 a colloquialism that Hilderich never inquired further about.
 What he did inquire about though upon seeing the machine intently studying
 the holographic projection in front of him was their destination, to which
 the machine had said without turning to face Hilderich:

Hilderich looked at the cup of hot black beverage that he held in his hands.
 Aromatic though it was and totally exotic to him, it had a very strong

 He was now looking at the ever jovial machine with a hint of worry, completely
 ignoring the machine's comment on his personal hygiene:
