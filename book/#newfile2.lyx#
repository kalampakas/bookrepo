Are you sure about this?

 asked Schneider.
 He wasn't wearing his usual labcoat, just some shorts and a T-shirt with
 the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Fuck Nobel, I want my own award
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shoddily stamped on it, the 'N' in Nobel almost chipped out of existence.

No, not by a long shot,

 replied Bob, his voice trailing off with some anxiety.
 He kept fiddling around with his extravagantly bulbous red suit, nervously
 checking and re-checking seals, wristbands, valves and plugs.
 Schneider gripped him by the shoulders pads, forcing Bob to make the eye
 contact which almost everyone avoided.

Don't.
 Touch.
 The Suit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Schneider.
 His words carried strangely ominous undertones.
 He then smiled sharply.
 As Bob had mentioned on multiple occassions, Schneider gave him the creeps
 with that half-cracked smile of his.
 It was unsettling, and Bob wasn't feeling exactly fine at that point.
 He nodded his acknowledgement and stopped touching the suit.
 He sat motionless in The Chair, arms resting on the sides of the chair.
 Bob thought that he'd repeat the same technique that had kept him calm
 throughout the research and endless trials: he started counting.

\begin_layout Standard
There were forty-nine cooling lines, eighty-four power lines, one hundred
 and sixty-seven signal lines and twenty-three gaseous mixture lines.
 They were supported on two hundred and seventeen metal clips, poles, and
 columns.
 There was a metal grid with nine hundred and seventy-two panels, supporting
 the roof as well as the experiment's infrastructure.

\begin_layout Standard
There was him, Schneider, fifty-seven technicians, thirteen PhD's, four
 Nobel-prize winners and two soon-to-be.
 All in all, seventy-eight people, seventy-seven souls.
 It was widely claimed that Schneider had sold his, a rumour that he had
 never refuted and always strengthened by simply smiling.
