\begin_layout Section
The hunter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hunter felt the air thicken.
 He ventured a look towards the gathering storm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wind started to gather into brief furious gusts, fallen golden leaves
 dancing around him.
 Fleets of scurrying animals could be heard, running for refuge, burrowing
 in whatever shelter the forest could provide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His prey seemed indifferent to the coming weather though.
 The tracks were heavy-laden, and steady, even purposeful.
 It wanted to be found.
 It was as if it was challenging him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He crouched low amidst a thick cluster of bush and peered into the ashen
 wall of birch trees, his senses on the edge, everything around him pulsing
 with intensity, his mind focused on his prey.
 He emptied his thoughts, and closed his eyes.
 He reached for the small pendant around his neck, a golden tipped arrow
 felling a silver eagle.
 With a silent prayer to God and a fire burning from within him, he darted
 off into the trees, the shadows they cast over his hooded figure almost
 failing to touch it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His feet carried him on a galloping pace, fast and steady, swiftly cutting
 through the forest, following the clear, fresh tracks.
 The scent he traced was still strange, neither like any animal or man he
 had met or heard of before.
 He paused to sample the soil, feel the ground with his hands.
 He tasted copper and a tingling sensation lingered on his tongue.
 He strung an arrow through his bow and felt exhilarated, brimming with
 a confidence he deserved well.
 The deeper he went into the woods, the stronger the expectation for the
 kill became.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As his breathing became faster so did his pace, his form blending in with
 the forest like a blur.
 His chest and leggings in brown and dark green leathers, with the coppery
 scale mail overlaid made for perfect camouflage in the autumn woods.
 Silent, swift and deadly, he had the advantage.
 He had smeared his exposed flesh with fresh dirt and his bodice was treated
 with boar fat, to preserve the leather and cover up his human scent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stealthy as possible, he followed a small stream that led to the east,
 to the Hollows.
 The tracks started to become faint, the soft dirt heavier and crisper.
 The scent grew mellow, the metal taste in his mouth waned.
 He was losing his prey.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He lay still for a moment and took a westward look, towards the clearing
 from where he entered the forest.
 Above the forest ceiling he could make out the grim blue and black of the
 stormy clouds.
 Lightning flashed the scenery alight, the trees around him casting shadows
 like the fanged mouth of a terrible behemoth, menacing and unescapable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trickle of the stream was drowned under an ominous thunder.
 The first drops of rain fell on his cape.
 He felt he was now losing the advantage.
 The scent of his prey would be washed away, his vision would be of little
 help in the chaos of a storm, the forest would be filled with distant shadows
 and all noise would be lost under the thunder and the falling rain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a hint of sight, sound or smell, his chest caught fire.
 The hunter frantically searched for his foe, but then a second and third
 fiery sting brought him to the ground.
 His face was contorted with a soundless expression of pain and amazement.
 It felt like arrows had pierced his armor but there were no arrow stalks
 or heads.
 It mystified him, that he should die in such a fashion, never once seeing
 what or who took his life.
 The world around him became grey and he felt a rush of pain before his
 senses finally failed him.
 His breathing stopped, and with the forest ceiling occupying his view,
 the hunter exhaled laboriously and silently prayed to God for the last
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The dancer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She revelled in the darkly lit chambers, her form that of a swirling dervish,
 the locks of her hair mirroring the precious light with an intoxicating
 sheen of honey and brown, ethereal smell of roses and lavender pouring
 out of her skin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She moved as if the ground was a mere illusion to be disregarded, her arms
 faintly bent upwards as if praying, or caressing the lithe forms of young
 gods, and her face had the impression of unborn awe, mesmerizing to see,
 inviolate to the touch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She danced to the sounds of incessantly beating drums, in patterns and rhythms
 deep and rumbling that thumped her very soul, following a melody of strings
 as clear as a mountain spring erupting, a fresh dew engulfing the chamber,
 and a band of flutes calling out to unseen spirits, as if a ritual of old
 was being performed for her pleasure alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music reached a crescento, a groundshaking climax and she became frenzied
 with passion, exhuming a mystical air of love, a beacon of a haven for
 all the unloved ones, an unseen contract with a muse behind each tempting
 gesture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her faint gossamer dress swirled and failed to contain her ethereal form
 in such a breathtaking way, that even the flames of the brazers around
 the chamber flickered in tune with her dancing form to cast shadows that
 seemed to have a life of their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd around her was silent and still, wearing almost identical masks
 of brass, the few flames that illuminated the chamber adorning them with
 golden hues of honey and a glimmer of sunlight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single man stood at the edge of the dancing stage, robed with heavy linen,
 his face unmasked for everyone to see, tears running down his cheeks, welling
 under his chin in an unwavering steady flow, his face a painful mix of
 sorrow and awe, his eyelids closed shut in a vein attempt to contain his
 tears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the climax of her dance, she laid her body down, planted her feet and
 hands to the stage, her back forming an arc.
 And then she convulsed in a familiar but unspoken way, the way of ecstasy,
 her pelvis moving to the rhythm of the drums, faster and faster, as if
 an invisible lover was being forced upon her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music came abruptly to a stop and utter silence filled the chamber.
 She sagged to her knees, her hair conceiling her face completely.
 The silence was deafening, the only sound her ragged breath.
 Then the unmasked man spoke while bowing solemnly:
\end_layout

Celia, I lack the words.
 The Chorus weeps in adoration.
 Let everyone be witness to this moment: Celia danced the Edichoros, and
 the Gods were pleased.
 So says the Chorus.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a transient moment of still time, the crowd of masks said in one voice:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Aye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As soon as the word was spoken, the masked men dispersed as if answering
 to a silent summons and melted into the shadows, as if they were never
 really there, as if they had been a mirage, a background for this dance
 alone.
 The dancer and the unmasked man still remained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He extended his arms, palms facing upwards, a gesture to the dancer or mayhap
 the Gods themselves.
 She stood up on her bare feet slowly, her hands touching her thighs over
 her gossamer dress, strands of her hair upon her bare shoulders.
 He spoke more softly, as if not to be overheard, even though there was
 not a living soul around in earshot.
\end_layout

Celia, my love.
 Come.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At his words, she touched his palms and drew closer to him.
 She looked upon his face, wet with tears and lit by flickering flames,
 her hazel eyes still glittering with ecstasy, alight with enthusiasm, and
 yet forming a wizened look that belied her years.
\end_layout

 You need not worry anymore.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And you, will you cherish those tears?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 look on her eyes.

Need you ask?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 nose, the lobes of her ears, her slender neck, her measured lips and back
 to her stare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am only a woman, Amonas.

\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Celia said and hushed him by touching his lips with hers, then embracing
 his neck with both hands, softly but steadfastly guiding him towards her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afterwards they made love on that very stage, the silence of the chamber
 broken only by the sound of sputtering candles and braziers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Curator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A man dressed in dark crimson robes and a sky blue sash made haste up the
 keep's long winding staircase.
 Perspiration covered his craggy old leathery face, his grey bearded chin
 still awash with the wine he had spilt only moments earlier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Not now, not here.Damn the fools, damn them!", he kept repeating to the
 deaf, heavy-set stone walls, with almost every breath.
 The flickering flame of the torch he held cast his form in shadows over
 the stones of the stair's steps, on the dank walls.
 The form of a stumbling, muttering old fool.
 Even the shadows seemed to mock him, crouching even lower than him as the
 staircase finally unwound onto the roof of the keep.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Why now, while I still draw breath?", said the old man as he caught his
 breath, and started off to find what it was he came looking for.
 As if long ago forgotten, he fumbled around the roof, while a lukewarm
 dusk gave way to a chilling, gloomy moonless night.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept straightening his beard with one hand, while his eyes were closed,
 and his other hand was raised, a pondering finger waving in a hazy, uncertain
 rhythm.
 As if trying to catch up with a silent tune only he could hear.
 Suddenly, he opened his eyes and set off with his head intently searching
 the floor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The air smelled of liquorice and the burned wheatstalks of nearby farmsteads.
 Planting season.
 He looked annoyed, trying to pick up a loose cobblestone from the roof.
 It gave no purchase, and try as he might he could not so remove it.
 He grumbled a mild curse, unbefitting of his Office, status, demeanor,
 or personality.
 But to hell with all that.
 It wouldn't matter soon, none of it would, he thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standing upright, he folded his arms and breathed deeply, his elbows sagging
 slightly, his chin almost touching his chest.
 He sighed, and then abruptly erupted with a flurry of curses, kicks, punches
 and stomps again quite unseemly for a person of his stature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Curator.
 By mutual assent among his peers, not a very prestigious one, but nonetheless,
 a Curator.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he drew a few deep breaths before standing
 over one ledge from the roof and shouting, almost in a screech: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hilderich!!Hilderich!" An answering shout came from somewhere below: "Over
 here master Olom, over here!" The curator leaned over the ledge, searching
 for a face to direct his ire at, to no avail.
 He shouted once more, throwing his fists wildly into the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hilderich, you mongrel! Fetch the keystone from my study, run like there's
 no tomorrow!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the curator and Hilderich complied smartly to the best of his abilities.
 A few moments passed then, and a lot of things happened at once.
 First, a few steps behind where the Curator stood, the air twisted and
 reality gave way to nothingness, where a large kind of slit formed suddenly
 and the world seemed as if made of a paper tapestry badly sewn together.

The Curator felt a strange rush of stinging air, turned about slowly, and
 had time enough to yell one last time at his pupil:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Run now! Find the one I dared not!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Hilderich ran outside the small keep, his gaze locked with the despairing
 eyes of his master, whose last look implored him silently to live.
 A hooded form seemed to grab Curator Olom from his neck with a single armored
 hand and lift him over the keep's parapet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderic stood there for a moment transfixed, overtaken by the speed and
 incredulity of what was taking place.
 When the hooded figure turned its head slowly towards him, fear pierced
 his heart.
 When it threw the Curator down to his death, it was still looking at him,
 only now Hilderich was running, eyes wide with horror, hands gripping the
 keystone with white knuckles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hooded figure stood where the curator had been standing only moments
 earlier, the slit behind it now gone, as if it had been a trick of the
 eye.
 With scarcely a thought, it jumped off the keep's roof and landed on its
 two feet, barely registering the 60-foot drop.
 As it turned to run after Hilderich, it paused instinctively after feeling
 the bloodied hand of the dying Curator tugging at his plated boot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Had to make sure first.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the curator through agonising pain and a broken jaw while clutching
 his pendant, when both him, the keep, and the figure trying to smash his
 head with his boot instantly became a thing of the past, bright white light
 suddenly filling the dusky plains accompanied by an eerie, unnatural, unnerving
 silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich only felt a haze of feat and a tingling at the back of his head.
 He dared not stop or look back, he simply ran.
 And prayed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The jester
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grand audience hall was fabulously lit through grandiose arched windows
 on either side.
 Sunlight glistened off the brass and gold etched everywhere around the
 hall, from chandeliers to decorative ornaments, marked with the livery
 of the Castigator.
 Crests and banners engraved with family mottos, finely crafted from materials
 of the highest quality, hung in carefully positioned places around the
 hall, denoting their respective family's status, lineage, and nobility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sweet aromas of burnt incense, cinnamon and musk permeated the air, bouquets
 of freshly picked flowers from young maidens with the colors of the rainbow
 were abundantly strewn around in neat vases and edifices all around the
 thick marble pillars that supported the magnificently painted dome, depicting
 wondrous scenes from the history, mythology, and tradition of the Outer
 Territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A ruckus of tingling bells and a limerick tune of chords echoed in the vastness
 of the audience hall, a single tinny voice singing along:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse

\size footnotesize
Five pieces of gold that shone, and the sight of her alone

\begin_layout Verse

\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse

\size footnotesize
As long as clouds grace the sky, as long as He will die
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The jester played out the last part of the tune, merrily dancing around
 the main hall, a wide smile seemingly permanently carved on his painted,
 multicoloured face.
 As he hit the last of the chords, he ended his performance with a wide
 curved bow towards the man who sat in the center of the audience throne,
 his sole spectator, and waited there, for a few moments, until he heard
 a morose voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I tire of you too easily these days, Perconal.
 You used to be more, ah..
 Fun.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the voice that belonged to the Castigator of the Outer Territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I could do the leap-frog again, sire.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the jester countered with a hopeful proposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That only seemed funny at the time since you leap-frogged onto the Patriarch
 and the Procastinator Militant.
 Never saw a Procastinator Militant fumble for his sword before.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the Castigator responded absent-mindedly, his head resting on his left
 hand, a goblet of wine on his right one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No crowd today, sire.
 Who could I leap-frog onto then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the jester insisted while fumbling with his crown of bells, his smile
 turning into an ever more persistent grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No crowd indeed.
 I believe I tire of crowds as well lately.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, proferred the jester, shamelessly making a rude pelvic thrust in the air,
 his hands mockingly grasping at an imaginary waist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator seemed to offer a little time to the idea, but a disapproving
 nod of his head made the jester suddenly wear the face of a crying, hurt
 man, shoulders slumped, hands knead together, as if pleading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, Perconal.
 I'm not in the mood.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Then games sire! Games are always fun! And a challenge! Or are you, afraid?Surel
y not!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the jester said in a booming voice, and then exploded into a series of
 mock athletic gestures, like running, jumping and javelin throwing, flexing
 pitiful muscles, kneeling and offering an invisible crown to the Castigator,
 looking as solemn and expressionless as a grave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Games, you say?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the Castigator seemed briefly intrigued, and now rested his head on both
 hands, his voice slighty muffled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While he seemed to ponder the idea, the jester scurried soundlessly near
 the table where the goblet of wine lay, and with a wide grin forming on
 his shallow face once again, he mischievously reached for it.
 The Castigator took notice, but said nothing.
 Eyes darting to and fro, the jester sipped some wine off the goblet, painted
 lips smearing its bronze, delicately decorated surface, with white powder
 and red and violet paint.
 As the jester closed his eyes and savoured the exquisite vintage, he felt
 icy steel hard against his throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Feuillout usually leaves too dry an aftertaste, don't you think?

 set against the jester's throat, edge flashing bright from the sunlight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Sire.
 I transgressed.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That you did, Perconal.
 I hate it when you do that.
 I thought more of you.

\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was tempted sire.
 I haven't tasted wine, any wine, since ..
 I really can't remember.
 Truthfully.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the jester almost cried out the last few words, his head bowing in submission,
 his hands fumbling with his chordus, careful not to touch any strings lest
 he make a note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, no matter.
 Tomorrow you will be castigated, forty lashes should be enough.
 People have been hanged for less.
 Water is so scarce, yet you would risk your life to indulge in wine tasting,

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you sir.
 Can I at least have another sip, sire? It is so sweet.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, said the jester with a half-formed smile and hint of a gesture towards
 the goblet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Another sip? Ha! There you go Perconal, you actually made me laugh.
 Ha ha!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a loud laugh and a smile formed on the Castigator's usually bored, flat
 face, before throwing the goblet on a nearby column, wine spilling all
 over the black, shiny, green veined granite floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There you go! Lap it up, you fool! Leave none for the maidens!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, shouted the Castigator, a furious laughter welling up, unable to contain
 it.
 And Perconal, the Jester, helplessly ran about the marble floor, trying
 to sip as much of the spilled wine as he could, his bells and jingles ringing
 and echoing in the empty hall.

'Tis none of my business, young sir, but given the chance and all since
 I don't get many passengers through here this ferry, so far away from the
 Basilica Road and all, might I ask where do you come from? Beg your pardon.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 passenger a casual gaze, his hands on the boat's rows beating them in and
 out of the water in a calm, slow rhythm.

 trailing with a hint of worry and nervousness, his eyes averted from the
 surrounding fog and water, focused instead on the boat itself, as if an
 invisible wall made such an effort mundane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Why shouldn't it be? The water's dead still, and there no rocks on the other

The Pilgrim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His feet were sore.
 Cold air rushed to meet his face, the flimsy cloak offering a little less
 than adequate protection.
 Tall grass grew on either side of the rocky path through the hills.
 The cries of a crow accompanied the howling gusts of the wind, the sky
 a bleak grey, just like the days before.
 He looked around, searching for some kind of shelter at least until the
 wind died down.
 He knew he had to rest soon, his body ached and his legs felt like lead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spotted a large bark of a tree, a large oak, hollowed out, grizly and
 old.
 He made a rush of straining effort to reach it quickly, further up the
 hill.
 A little more pain and then he could sit for a change.
 Perhaps even sleep, cold wind or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The oak was a perfect fit, large enough to lay down with only a small opening
 a lean man had to go through sideways.
 He was lean.
 And hungry, cold, tired and groggy.
 As he put down his knapsack, he grimaced with pain from stiff muscles.
 He lay down, on the ground, and felt like all his cares and troubles in
 the world were suddenly lifted, he felt light as a feather, numbness encircling
 his senses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stretched his feet and looked up, a small crack on the bark letting the
 sky seep through.
 His sight wandered to the clouds passing overhead, grey tints on blue black
 matresses, like forlorn shapes running through a twisting, foaming river.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He closed his eyes, and muttered a prayer, thanking his God for the timely
 shelter, feeling he was being looked after, cared for, like his pilgrimage
 was an extraordinary thing, a matter of grave importance, a mission he
 had to carry out, a mission worthy of every little help.
 All he had to do was have faith, and he would persevere, and his God would
 keep a watchful eye, and provide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon, he fell asleep, laying there seemingly dead as the wood around him.
 He dreamt, but he would remember nothing when he would wake up.
 His chest rised and fell in a slow, laborious rhythm.
 And all around the oak, the grass bend where the wind blew.
 And the crows had stopped their crying, some of them perched on the very
 same oak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few drops of rain started falling, and pretty soon it turned into a drizzle,
 thin and almost refreshing, a gift of shower the earth accepted eagerly.

Dangers of the trade
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing that assaulted Hilderich's senses were the smells.
 Lost in a smelting crowd of city people, the smells were overpowering:
 the acrid sweat of unkempt horses mingled with rosewood and cinder scraps
 from the carpenters' workshops, heavy spices like cinammon and uwe flared
 his nostrils while an essence of oils and meats wandered through the air,
 the smell of filthy beggars waxing and waning around every corner, its
 temporary absence filled in with incense from close by temples and intoxicating
 perfumes from passing, illustrious carriages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mix of sounds though felt familiar, reminding him of bees buzzing through
 the meadows back home, whole swarms feeding on the nectar of roleva flowers,
 over a golden carpet swaying gently under the evening gale.
 Now and then some voices stood taller than the rest, hints of selling wares
 and the ever present and watchful Ministers announcing laws, edicts and
 verdicts, punishments, and religious texts, all for the good of the people.
 The cacophony was further accented by the clacking sounds of hooves, pig
 cries and beggars' pleas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tall arches overhead cast angled shadows everywhere, the encircling walls
 of the buildings like sheer cliffs towering over the palpitating mass of
 people, animals and all the rest that could not readily fit into either
 category.
 Blue-grey rock and lime mortar dominated the market's landscape, the wear-torn
 cobblestones of the streets a hazy washed white wherever the grit and mass
 of people allowed a small glimpse.
 And street after street, wall after wall, bronze engraved plaques embellished
 with holy texts and iconography hung on arches, balconies and posts, in
 favor of the Gods, in memory and glory of the Castigator and the Pantheon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the market was the heart of the city as its inhabitants claimed, then
 what was said of Pyr being a heartless bitch seemed at once both right
 and wrong.
 Every single cast, class and type of man was to be found here, buying,
 selling, begging, stealing, killing, blackmailing and dying.
 There were parts of the market where the suns had never shown upon them
 since the city was built, dark corners where those who entered usually
 did not reappear, and when they did, blood not their own had been spilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beggars had become part of the landscape, blinds, invalids, all sorts
 of castaways and society's detritus, tugging away at embroidered hems,
 pleading with sore voices and grotesque faces.
 Those of them who bothered the wrong people time and again were soon beaten
 or stabbed to death by lackeys and guardsmen, left for dead on the spot,
 attracting the ire of honest, hard working merchants and artisans for not
 having the decency to crawl away from near their workshops and stalls and
 die someplace else where they would not put off potential customers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this was at the same time the place where everything of import came
 to be; this was where produce from the surrounding fields and indeed neighborin
g territories was gathered and sold to those who could afford it.
 This was where artisans created common everyday wares, materials and tools
 as well as delicate, commisioned works of art, this was the place were
 deals and partnerships were entered and broken, contracts signed and carried
 out, where everyone, whether a layman or a noble, had some kind of business.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the place were the Ministers' chants were heard every day, preaching,
 teaching, and enforcing the religion that is Law.
 The market, in that sense, was a living representation, a miniature of
 where and how the people of Pyr lived their lives, and even how some of
 them lost them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was drifting along the current of people flowing incessantly through
 the market, occassionally bumping onto variously indifferent or protesting
 men, taking care of the treads of carts, running heralds and practicing
 pickpockets.
 He could hear the Minister from the next street calling out a long list
 of names, and his eye caught two men in an unlit alley cracking another
 man's skull, their shadowy outline briskly contrasting with the lit background
 of the large street behind the small alley.
 It seemed dishearteningly clear that this was business as usual here, that
 some code of practice had been followed and the formalities obeyed, killing
 a faceless man hidden away from the light of the suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His almost random course took him closer to the Minister's spot, an elaborate
 fountain made of granite, engraved with scenes of an historic battle from
 the Heathen times he could remember learning about as a child, but could
 not immediately recognise.
 The Minister held a distaff on one hand, heavy-looking and oblique, and
 was still reading names off a long unwinding scroll fitted in some kind
 of extendable hook on the distaff that seemed purposefully designed.
 He wore a long robe made of violet velvet with a gold embroidered hem and
 a silver-lined crest of the Outer Territories on his chest, a small black
 cap with a single emerald denoting his office, and both of the robe's arms
 were filled with holy texts written in Lingua Helica, stitched in purple
 silk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ministers Hilderich had known made offerings to the Gods, upheld the
 Law and taught it.
 These holy men seemed somewhat distasteful, one might even call them pompous.
 He wondered what Master Olom's remark would have been and he was reminded
 of the duty he had yet to fulfill.
 He ignored the small mass of people gathered around the Minister as well
 as the rest of the still unfolding list of names, and lost himself once
 more in the throng of people, his senses acutely attuned by now, searching
 for a sign that would bring him a step closer to finding the one man he
 was searching for ever since that fateful night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought of the word conjured in his mind a brief glimpse of that night,
 an almost morbid recollection of what had happened.
 He had barely had time to stop and ponder the minutiae, while trying to
 get to Pyr as fast as possible, the place where he had to start his possibly
 vain search.
 The more he thought about what had exactly happened, the more he failed
 to grasp how everything had come crashing down like an avalanche, one moment
 of perfect stillness followed by sheer and utter terror, an unavoidable
 terrible fate.
 Such was the end of Master Olom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though he would not admit to it, he felt he somehow cheated death on
 that night, that it should have been him rather than his Master, or at
 least he should have had the same luck, at least as a matter of principle.
 Thankfully, wise Olom, though considered a relative unknown, with a handful
 of friends and none in high places, thought otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Never pausing in his stride, Hilderich closed his eyes and clutched the
 keystone his master had entrusted him with, ever so tightly.
 He had taken extra precautions ever since he had to carry the strange artifact
 with him.
 He always kept it on his person, and had fashioned a small metal holder
 with a small but sturdy chain fastened to his thick leather belt, resembling
 more the small cage of a sparrow, made of thin sheets of metal he had scrounged
 off the stables of an inn, the second day since he ran away from that explosion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That inexplicable explosion of light and heat, like hundreds of oil barrels
 and steamers going off at once, only neither was to be found even a day's
 ride away, much less unaccountably stored there at the keep.
 It could be something Ancient, it must have been something Ancient.
 But his knowledge of the Old People and their ways and artifacts was still
 little, and as far as he knew, no such examples were in master Olom's care,
 nor had he seen or heard any hint of such awesomely destructive or powerful
 items during the last four years.
 But, what else could it be? Unless the Gods had revealed themselves in
 blessed fury and might.
 Wouldn't they have spared his master?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He let out a sigh without noticing, his head slightly slumped, his expression
 sour.
 He had been so deeply engrossed in thought, that when he ventured a look
 he found himself utterly lost with no sense of direction, in a part of
 the market conspicuously calm, lacking the overwhelming mass of people
 that offered a false sense of safety that was nevertheless more welcome
 than none at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distant din of the market proper could still be heard, but he had walked
 quite a distance and the crowd of people looked a little more than a milling
 sea of garments and bustling feet.
 With the corner of his eye he glimpsed a pair of shady figures was stalking
 him, probably had been for a while, and were just about to gank up on him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was not a stoutly built fellow, and did not consider himself neither
 a man of action or capable of putting up a serious fight.
 But he had faith in his master, and his quest preceded everything else.
 He had to preserve his life in order to preserve the keystone, so he chose
 the most viable and logical course of action under the circumstances: he
 ran like hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He suddenly darted off towards the direction of what seemed to be a large
 bell tower, and ventured a slight look over his left shoulder to get the
 bearing of the figures behind him.
 They were just beyond hand's reach when he started running, his heavy cloak
 waving wildly, feet scurrying on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them cursed profoundly and the other one shouted at him to stop,
 then both of them went on a chase after him.
 Hilderich went right and left through alleys and larger streets, sometimes
 under shadow and others under light, trying to keep the tower that somehow
 seemed a safe place in sight, while at the same time trying to give his
 pursuers the slip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sound of boots on stone was still unmistakeably behind him, and sweat
 had started to pour out of his body.
 He went past small houses, inns, and squares, while fleeing for what seemed
 his life, and curiously enough his mind registered that not a housewive
 or elder man ventured more than an indifferent look at the chase taking
 place in front of their eyes, only the children paused in their play to
 look, point and giggle excitedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His feet started to ache and his breathing became short and almost painful,
 fire welling up in his lungs.
 He knew he could not keep this up for long, and the tower he had set out
 to reach did not seem much closer than earlier.
 He ventured a slight look over his right shoulder, and couldn't see either
 of the figures chasing him.
 He listened intently for a few moments and could not make out the distinct
 noise of chasing boots, only rather his own two feet galloping achingly.
 He allowed himself a drop in pace, easing his breathing, coming to a slow
 stop near a shadowy wall, bent over with hands on his knees, throwing scared
 looks around, hoping that the chase was over now.

, the man's gruff voice seemed to come through the wall of stone, but he
 was only hiding deeper into the shadow of an adjoining alley, Hilderich
 instinctively turning around, seeing a flash of light hinting at an unsheathed
 knife or sword, its wholeness under the cover of dark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment he drew enough of a breath to dart off again in another random
 direction, slipping away at the last minute like before, but then he noticed
 the other man, a red-haired bearded brute, pieces of armor showing underneath
 his shabby clothes, a jagged knife in hand, standing a few paces to his
 right, steadfastly covering both ways out of his predicament.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With no real options left, Hilderich suddenly leapt on the nearest man,
 blade or not, in what could only really be a selfless last act of defiance,
 thinking he was soon about to die, failing his master for the last time.
 Nevertheless, he would give his all, and while he leapt his gathered his
 fist aiming for the man's head, trying to deliver as much pain as possible.
 The punch never connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man still standing inside the shadows expertly and calmly took a step
 back and bend his back slightly, with Hilderich's wild effort going awry,
 hitting nothing but air, losing his balance and making a counter-step.
 Just as he could feel his face freeze in astonishment, he brought his other
 hand backwards in order to try and have another go at punching his assailant.
 He did not manage that in any event though, because he winced and doubled-up
 at the paralyzing pain from the knee that had firmly and powerfully connected
 with his belly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt his stomach empty and his sight go blurry, a hint of red clogging
 his sight, his feet going limp and heavy, his breathing shallow.
 The last thing he saw before he passed out, was a grinning mouth and the
 icy clear flash of a steel blade.

 She drew the bedsheets against her body, curling up onto the empty side

 She felt the unborn child inside her stir uncomfortably, as if awoken with
 terror by the same dream.
 She laid her hands on her belly, gently caressing it, feeling the child

 She saw Amonas' head on a pike, along with hundreds of other men's heads,
 hellishly put on display in a gory show, seething masses of animals rather

The hair on her back was raised and she felt as helpless as a thawing flake
 of snow, unable to comfort herself and lay back to sleep, the shocking

 She stood up with some effort, and with slow attentive paces, made it to
 the balcony.
 The night was invitingly chilly, offering a crystal clear sky, the few
 clouds overhead like thin gossamer webs the Gods might have woven to catch
 a falling star.
\end_layout

She peered out over the never-sleeping city, its market always alight with
 torches and large common pyres, strange shadows flickering on walls, fleetingly
 illuminated faces with blank expressions, as if in a haze of ecstasy, whirling
 in the rhythmic dance of the city like strands of cloth spun in the air.

The Ministry Tower and the Disciplinarium were lit as bright as day, proud
 banners flung high and wide, a procession of ministers underway, and another
 festivity in the Disciplinarium's garden that sported tricks of fire and

 and splashes of green and blue light, as if there was not a care in the

The rugged brown stonework of the balcony felt rough under her smooth touch.
 She moved her hand unconsciously across the stone while gazing at the city,
 vainly searching for her loved one among the sands of men.

 couldn't hear, like conducting an invisible chorus of spirits of old inhabiting
 this very stone.

She closed her eyes momentarily and the image of Amonas' head haunted her,
 his blood still pouring hot.
 She held her breath and moved her lips in silent prayer, wishing her dream

 Her faith should not waver, she must be strong enough for Amonas' sake,
 and for their unborn child.
 Let the Gods carry them forward and all will be as it should be.

 Had he failed already? Was there a point to all this? His face took on

Amonas was in an instant transformed in Hilderich's eyes.

 I might confess, I find some of the Castigator's and the ministers decisions

 That remark made Philo move and fidget with suppressed anger, shooting
 pleading looks at Amonas, clearly intent at putting the audacious little

 Amonas would have none of that and dismissed Philo's silent protests with
 an outstretched hand, replying in a serious and honest tone of voice:

Hilderich pondered this for a while and in his mind dismissed the idea the
 food would be poisoned, since if they wanted him dead, they wouldn't have
 bothered with all this.
 It seemed somewhat of a concession to the man effectively holding him captive,

 He precariously managed to reach the safety of a nearby table, putting

Darkly lit night
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Disciplinarium's large audience hall was exquisitely decorated with
 fine tapestries, hung from the columns and walls with golden ropes and
 aggrandized with silk laces, freshly picked fragrant flowers and all manners
 of highly luxurious pomp and ceremony.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though night had already fallen, giant ornate silver and brass chandeliers
 hung from the high ceilings, illuminating the grand hall with the light
 of thousands candles, their beams of light enhanced and mirrored by the
 all the brass, gold and silver decorations strewn around almost every object
 in the hall, making them glitter and shine, magnifying their splendor tenfold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Delicately detailed lifelike oil paintings adorned each wall, previous Castigato
rs and Archministers, Procastinator Militants and Patriarchs, noble supporter
 families of the Castigator, every last important person that was notably
 recorded in history books was to be found here in the form of awe inspiring
 portraits, paintings and sculptures from the most talented artists of each
 generation from around the lands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mass of people was still flowing slowly but steadily into the hall,
 and for a time it would seem like the small swarm of men was going to swell
 to inelegant numbers.
 But the Castigator's people who were in charge of the eventful night, those
 who orchestrated and planned who was to be given the praise of summons,
 also decided the place and time of his appearance as well as whether or
 not he should have the privilege of being able to dine at the same table
 as the Castigator, albeit always at an innocuous distance, a table seat
 that implied an immense increase of status and almost unrivalled political
 power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the time for the opening ceremonies for the grand festive night grew
 closer, all needed preparations were being doubly checked, and the gathering
 of guests efficiently monitored.
 Everything seemed to be in place, refreshments and drinks served in silver
 plated cups, and sweetmeats, fruit, and fine pastries circulating among
 the crowd in golden platters by busy servants, dressed in fine cloth wearing
 the green livery of the Castigator's office, a white eagle bearing a book
 and a key, a snake held in its beak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People were chatting in low voices, politely exchanging greetings and news
 when being personal acquaintances, though some of the more brazen guests
 that either lacked the knowledge of etiquette or were in a position to
 ignore it as a whole or in part, were already laughing heartily at jokes
 or anecdotes between friends and close acquaintances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone attending had been careful to dress as stylishly as possible, and
 according to wealth and status, there were examples of extravagant overdressing
, with some people resembling moving heaps of a treasury or jewelry shop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Others preferred to overstate their presence with exotic cloths and tailorings,
 usually uncommon and outlandish, suggesting time and money spent just for
 this one occasion.
 Indeed, everyone was wearing the best and brightest they could afford,
 and maybe some had even took on a loan to have something special tailor-made
 in order to try and stand out in the crowd, in a bid to improve their fame
 and fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The atmosphere in the hall was generally convivial though mildly restrained
 because of the premises and significance of the night.
 The festivities were taking place in order to commemorate the Castigator's
 25th Term in Office, which coincided with the Pacification of Zaelin, the
 last of the Territories to be enlightened and brought under the Law of
 the Pantheon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rumors circulated among the nobles' elite and people in the army and the
 Ministry that the Castigator would be announcing a decision of major importance
 that would stir up the relatively still affairs of the Territories, perhaps
 ushering a new era of glory to the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, it would be an eventful night, with dancing troupes of wondrous
 abilities, unsurpassed technique and airy grace performing for the duration,
 bards of worldly renown and enchanting voices singing the Mythos in praise
 of the Castigator and the Pantheon, a telling re-enactment of the Pacification
 of Zaelin and the striking down of the last Heathen, Parnoth Larthiel,
 the Last Ignorant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The re-enactment would also offer a kind of prize to one of the guests who
 would be lucky enough for his name to be drawn amongst hundreds: he would
 have the chance to play as the Castigator in the final duel with Parnoth,
 the unclaimed role filled in by a lawbreaker due for execution.
 The honoured guest in killing the lawbreaker-Parnoth would be spilling
 heretic blood in the service of the Ministry, the Castigator and the Law,
 possibly the highest service to the Pantheon possible, save sacrificing
 one's self while enforcing or upholding the Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A huge oblong platinum chime resounded by the stroke of an ornamental ram
 swung by two Protectors, the Castigator's personally hand-picked guard,
 and judging by their imposing physical builts apparently chosen chiefly
 for their brawn.
 The sound of the chime drowned out the chatter of the milling guests, reverbera
ting with a majestic effect in the audience hall, and signalling the official
 commencement of the festivities.
 Acoustics was one of many things not left to chance when the grandiose
 chamber was built.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd of guests went silent and ushered by dutiful servants and thick-set
 expressionless Protectors, gathered on two opposing sides of the hall,
 leaving a wide stretch of room where the Castigator would soon walk on.
 Indeed, the voice of the Chief Functionary boomed like a cannon in the
 night:

All kneel or be chastised, for now enters this hall his Holy Piousness,

 Territories.
 Kneel or be chastised!

, the last words uttered with the gravity of a holy commandment, the obvious
 threat to be carried out with ruthless deliberation if needs be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At once and in concert, the whole of the crowd, including servants, Protectors,
 Ministers, the whole of the Disciplanarium's staff, any and all figures
 of authority, military, civil or religious, including the Chief Functionary,
 kneeled on both legs and bowed their heads deeply and solemnly, as if in
 wholehearted prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The workings of some kind of large mechanism involving gears and other mechanica
l contraptions rang through the audience hall, and the massive copper tinted
 Gates of Leor opened slowly but steadily, revealing the radiant form of
 the Castigator, breathtakingly dressed in the formal robes of his Office,
 a deep crimson colour dyed in the blood of heathens and heretics, solid
 golden runes written in Helica Pretoria adorning the hem, and the Book
 of Law covering its surface with silk threads so fine that the artisans
 went blind from the effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And above the robes, an immaculate platinum breastplate, with no carvings,
 etchings or any decoration whatsoever.
 On one side, hung Urtis, the Mace of Judgment, the Castigator's long ago
 chosen tool of enlightenment and battle, that was said to have cracked
 as many heretic skulls as there are stones in the walls of the Disciplinarium.
 Indeed, some claim the very same skulls have been used in building the
 majestic building, as a morbid reminder that All is Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator strode with a steady pace down the central lane where a raised
 block of marble floor had appeared in sync with the opening of the Gates.
 The only audible sound was the sound of the Castigator's boots, a simple,
 utilitarian set of metal plated boots a soldier would wear, finely polished,
 but otherwise quite common.
 When he reached the dais on which the Seat of Office stood, he surveyed
 the crowd momentarily, sat down and clapped his bare hands once.

And the Castigator echoed back the mantra in solemn ritual, his voice carrying
 unusual depth and mesmerizing melody for a single man, however powerful
 and unique he may be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those that saw the Castigator and had not been granded such an honour before
 in their lives, were immediately left awestruck, and some of them broke
 down weeping, pious fervor instantly occupying their hearts and minds.
 Those that had been so blessed before, did not immediately stand but rather
 silently prayed with tears welling in their eyes, before being able to
 stand upright.
 The people that kept closer to the Castigator, his immediate entourage,
 the Ruling Council, and his guard intoned the holy mantra reverently and
 resumed their places and functions.
\end_layout

The Castigator then addressed the crowd which stood there reverently, their

The Castigator's voice turned from a sweet melody into a harsh pragmaticist's

The other members of the Ruling Council, the Archminister, the Patriarch,
 and the Noble Representative had their gaze locked on the Procastinator
 Militant, as if waiting for a sidestep or slip that would bring him crashing
 down in a most shameful and undignified way, an affront to the significance
 of the night.

The Noble Representative, dressed in a simple green robe of the practical

 a grin at the nearly unforgivable blunder that would have definetely incurred
 a public lashing and a year's donation to the Ministry, let alone probably
 kill the Procastinator Militant's carreer.

, the Castigator raised his arms in jubilance and smiled broadly, the atmosphere
 in the hall warming up in the blink of an eye, people starting to shuffle
 around, seeking food, drink, or whoever they had been talking with before
 the Castigator entered the hall.
 The announcement of setting out to pacify the last wild region, the Widelands,
 was definetely going to spur debate, however hushed, controlled, and unchalleng

Lord Umsepyre Remis, the Noble Representative, was seated in the council
 in order to speak on behalf of the noble families of the Outer Territories.
 His was a purely consultatory role, expressing current views among the
 noble houses, informing the Ruling Council of the ebbs and flows of power,
 wealth, and status, as well as the reactions and thoughts of the nobles
 on affairs of state, religion and Law.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though he had no voting rights in the Council, his input was often
 quite impossible to receive otherwise, any network of informers too crude
 in comparison.
 The Castigator seemed to consider him a quite valuable asset, judging by
 the special dispensations recently attributed to House Remis.
 In return, Umsepyre Remis was the best insightful eye and ear the Noble
 houses had concerning the inner workings of the Ministry and the Castigator,
 and solid knowledge of what went on in the Disciplinarium sometimes could
 buy things money could not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His was a unique position where he could not be accounted for practically

The music that would accompany the dancing acts had started with a brass
 fanfare, and soon settling in a soft string melody, oddly acented here
 and there by flutes and bass drums, the dancers performing choreographed
 scenes from the Mythos, reliving the handing down of the Law from the Gods
 to men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch noted the interest on Lord Remis face who was more than visibly
 enchanted by the dancers' performance, while the Procastinator Militant
 had hurriedly called for his chief aide, more so in order to look busy
 and industrious, rather than because actual operational planning could
 be done at thiss time and place.
 The Archminister was indeed busy on the other hand, a trio of scribes jotting
 down notes and letters to be sent immediately, notifying key personnel
 of the imminent rush of preparations that needed to start as soon as possible.

The Patriarch's tone was precipitously balanced between the whimsical and

The people in the village he went through last were the usual sort in these
 parts: animal herders mostly and a few wheat farmers.
 Simple people that prayed solemnly to the Gods, every day, wishing not
 for riches, power, lands and wives or other things of vanity beyond their
 grasp.
 They wished their child be spared of illness and harm, their herds be still
 whole by nightfall, the snow be light this year, and the rain plenty before

 He could feel sympathy like a man with sight feels for a man in the dark

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His road was about to take him through the Widelands, an unforgiving place.
 Few had made the passing, and even fewer were left sane and unscathed in
 body, soul and mind once they did.
 There were stories and legends about the Widelands, that were passed down
 from generation to generation, in many languages of many folk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of them he determined, were the superstitious tales of simpletons and
 madmen, mere fantasies for common people to spent the grinding, toiling
 days, thankful of their safe, ordinary, almost pitiful lives.
 Some were invariably twisted second and third-hand tales of those who ventured
 into the accursed place and came back, surely not wholesome and well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fact and fiction were interwoven tightly in such accounts, but some probable,
 shared truths could be distilled from the broth of rumblings, mutterings,
 and assorted hearsay that permeated the inns and taverns all across the
 Territories.
 There were even a few written accounts by people who seemed to have genuinely
 made the journey, and live to tell the tale and become rich and famous
 in the process, but most of them seemed to be very talented liars and writers,
 the distinction in their works of little significance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the Tale of Umberth could be counted as less than nefarious, since
 he set out with a hundredscore of men, of whom barely three survived: Umberth,
 his esquire Esphalon and a woman, then only a child, who Umberth claimes
 was found wandering alone, mute and dark-skinned, almost pitch-like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Umberth spent the rest of his days and sizable fortune trying to organize
 further trips into the Widelands, his few unsuccessful efforts presenting
 the girl as living proof of his sayings of underground cities, height-defying
 towers and huge arching constructs, but the girl could not even speak her
 name.
 Her skin color was a singular phenomenon that more often than not provoked
 the wrath of the Ministers and the aversion of crowds, speaking of heresy
 against the Gods and the bastard offspring of heathens and beasts of old
 that the earth unveiled from time to time to test the faithful and attract
 the blasphemer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not long after the Ministry declared her as well as Umberth heretics, an
 unrelenting manhunt together with the watchful, ever pious and dutiful
 believers of the Pantheon bore fruit and Umberth and the girl were beheaded
 and their bodies burned to ashes in Pyr, in the winter of the third pacificum,
 153rd annum, 51 days before the Solstice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Esphalon, his esquire, was sentenced to silence unto death and exiled, never
 to utter a word in his life again, his tongue cut out.
 He then wandered the northern lands, surviving on little more than worms
 and lichen, possibly wishing death for himself.
 In those lands, he came upon a small tribe of nomads, wild men that knew
 not how to herd sheep and work metal or clay, with wooden spears and no
 command of fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what Esphalon later describes, when he was trapped and caught like
 animal prey, probably destined for a savage death, perhaps a sacrifice
 or plain and simple cannibalism, the savages noticed while they searched
 his clothing a small plaque of metal, hand-sized, with no discerning characteri
stics other than a circular notch in its center, a memento from the Widelands.
 When they noticed that, Esphalon was greeted among them as an equal, a
 member of the tribe lost and found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He soon realised the importance of that plaque, and was further mystified.
 The savages used it to produce light and heat, by placing an ordinary stone,
 even a pebble, inside the notch.
 Pebbles and stones were the most widely used since they could be found
 in abundance in the northern rocky steppes were these people seemed to
 roam unhindered.
 Sometimes they used animal bones or pieces of wood, mostly whatever was
 handy at the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invariably, the said item slowly seemed to shrink and then vanish into thin
 air in a matter of moments, and then pleasant sunlight and radiant heat
 would emanate from the plaque for hours to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this and much more is written in Esphalon's memoirs, a corrugation of
 the things he saw and experienced in the wildlands coupled with what little
 time he spent with the savages.
 The plaque remained with the savage men who would not part with it in any
 way, and Esphalon reached an isolated fishing harbor facing the Pangalor
 Sea, half-dead from starvation, exhaustion, and lost a leg and three fingers
 from frostbite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was there were he wrote the Pangalor Scrolls, the single half-consistent
 work that contains enough about the Widelands to make it useful in crossing
 it, and perhaps uncovering more about this mysterious land and living long
 enough for others to know as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His reverie was broken by the cries of a nighthawk swooping in to catch
 his prey, somewhere out in the star-lit fields of short grass and poppies
 swinging gently in the night breeze.
 He marvelled at the arrogant precision and expert flying of the nighthawk,
 which made no effort to catch his prey unguarded, but instead seemed to
 announce indifferently it was about to kill and then feast on a helpless,
 doomed, animal soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled thinly and then got up, fastened his knapsack, picked up his walking
 stick and set off down the marble road.
 He looked overhead and saw the nighthawk soaring triumphantly, a small
 snake writhing in its death throes, captured in its beak.
 The nighthawk cried into the night once more, and then disappeared over
 the distance, its faint silhouette mingled with the starry blue and black
 sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marble road was glistening as always, unmarred by war or nature's wrath.
 He started humming an old tune his grandfather used to sing, and soon he

When they had eaten, after Amonas conferred with Philo, the burly man said
 he would be back soon.
 Hilderich had relaxed somewhat, but he could not for the life of him fathom
 the two men.
 It might be just as well.
 When he had seen whatever it was they wanted to show him, perhaps they
 would stick true to their word and release him, let go and consider him
 a friend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wasn't sure how exactly a person who planned overthrowing plots of heresy
 could afford to just tell people then let them go and trust their good
 souls to tell not, but he had a feeling it involved some kind of pain,
 extortion, or good old fashioned fall-assisted life removal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It just struck him odd.
 He felt he could trust this man, but his mind reeled at the prospect.
 I must be going slightly mad, he thought to himself.
 He was starting to think of ways he could snatch that keystone and make
 a run for it, but the more he thought about it the more stupid he felt.
 They had already outran him and outsmarted him once.
 Certainly he was no match for either one of them in single even unarmed
 combat.
 He now belatedly wished he had taken some time to practice his body rather
 than spent most of it knee deep in curatoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What mattered was that for now, he decided his best chances lay in playing
 along, and seeing what it was that they promised would change his mind
 and heart forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The faint dusk had just given way to a pure, clean night.
 As he lay there in his cot, he noticed Amonas had lit a large candle, and
 was reading what seemed to be letters.
 He noticed the man had been rather drawn into his reading material and
 decided against indiscretion on his part.
 Amonas through the corner of his eye though was aware of Hilderich mild
 scrutiny and without lifting his head from his reading, he said to him
 in an inviting, conversational tone:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Hilderich hadn't noticed so far.
 Perhaps he was being afflicted with a disease of the mind, something in
 the food.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he felt alright otherwise, he did not believe he was poisoned or otherwise
 tampered with.
 He just could not believe he was having a normal conversation with a person

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's thoughts were interrupted by Philo who entered the small room,
 hood still on his head.
 He nodded to Amonas, who in turn said to Hilderich:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich stood up and Amonas offered him a hooded cloak, somewhat more
 fine and more elegant than most.
 As soon as he wore it, Amonas was instructing Philo to lead them on and
 out into the city.
 Amonas would be trailing, and Hilderich would be in the middle, evidently
 a small precaution on their part should he feel a sudden urge to run like
 hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo lead them through somewhat shady alleys, light from far away lamps
 barely reaching them.
 They angled left and right, as if evading unseen stalkers.
 Perhaps there were some indeed.
 He would not be able to see them or smell them until too late in any case.
 So he trudged along.
 His knowledge of the city streets was perfunctory at best, but even he
 could discern that they were walking towards the Disciplinarium's hill.
 Even from a distance, the sounds of music and festivities could be heard,
 and a light show of fireworks seemed to be underway as well.
\end_layout

Hilderich mused inspite himself:

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas smiled wryly and urged him forward, while Philo turned his head around
 and stabbed Hilderich with his eyes.
 His attempt at humor went unanswered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more they approached the Disciplinarium, the more care they took in
 their approach, triple checking alleyways, hunching over shadows, their
 feet as light as cats', not a sound other than shallow breathing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they reached the base of the Disciplinarium's hill, Philo signalled
 them to stop dead in their shoes.
 He let a guard patrol vanish behind the curve of the hill's base before
 urging them to rush for a certain part of the slope, where the shadow of
 the aqueduct overhead would conceal them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did so with a dancer's grace and reached the grassy part of slope Philo
 had indicated.
 He took out a small knife from his belt, and Hilderich watched in still
 surprise as he dug out a small piece of tuft.
 A metal dial was to be found underneath, which then Amonas proceeded to
 twist left and right accordingly to some whim or unknown turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a sound a small tubular opening appeared above the dial, large enough
 for a man to fit inside but only in a prone position.
 It led into a shiny metal pipe or tube of some sort with a downward inclination
 whose other end was obscured in darkness, and judging from the light stream
 of air wafting through, it was a long pipe indeed.
\end_layout

Philo nodded to Amonas and said,

Philo was already sliding inside the mysterious and intriguing metalwork,

 such a notion exists.
 Amonas then ushered Hilderich inside, imparting a word of advice:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's terror was evident in the shrill quality of his voice.
 It had all happened too quickly to try and hold back, so when Amonas pushed
 him down the tubing, he tried to follow his advice, held his arms stiff
 to his body and started counting to thirty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tubing angled downwards pretty soon and Hilderich felt he was riding
 a children's slide, with the slight difference that the end of the slide
 was nowhere in sight, and mad, possibly delusional, quite certainly heretic
 thugs were shoving you down into one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich heard a splash echo dimly in the metal tubing, and was suddenly
 reminded of Amonas instruction.
 He wasn't sure if he had counted past thirty or not, his terror and anxiety
 mixed with his confounded thoughts a recipe against keeping calm and cool-heade
d.
 He filled his lungs with air as long as there was time anyway, and just
 when he started to think he had grievously mistimed his breath, he splashed
 into water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeling was one of quite shock, the cold water encircling his whole
 body, seeping through his clothes, assaulting his ears and nostrils, as
 if trying to enter his body without his will.
 His eyes had closed instinctively, then he opened them slowly, searching
 for the open surface, his hands wobbling uncertainly, before a small primal
 fear of running out of air urged him to swim upwards, towards what seemed
 to be a faint source of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within moments his head was clear of the water.
 He exhaled momentarily, then breathed in gasps until he could find his
 normal breathing once more.
 An outstretched hand seemed to be offering to help him out of the water.
 As soon as he realised it belonged to Philo, he heard another splash of
 water roughly behind him, and turned his head to look even as Philo pulled
 him to somewhat dry land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Amonas, who seemingly more accustomed to the area, needed no help
 and within seconds was among them, tiny rivulets of water still running
 down his leather vest, thick drops of water falling from his forehead.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 I'll keep my mouth shut.
 Are we near whatever place you think will change my mind? Are we below

\begin_layout Standard
They had fallen inside a natural cistern in a small rocky cave.
 Strangely enough, light seemed to seep through some cracks in the walls.
 With a closer inspection, Hilderich saw the cracks were more akin to lichen,
 faintly wet to the touch, but rough like sand as well.
 A sort of crystal formation seemed to lie underneath such spots.
 Philo nudged him onward, cutting his examination of the peculiarity short.
 It reminded him of some lesser kind of curatoria, that his master was not
 particularly interested in, and thus were only lightly studied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the light they gave off was indeed enough, even though only barely,
 to walk the gently curving twists and turns of what seemed to be an extensive
 network of caves, an almost ant-like structure, deep underneath the Disciplinar
ium's hill.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He noticed the steady, purposeful stride of Amonas before him, and the dim
 blue and violet light that imparted a grim hue on everything around and
 including them.
 A feeling of eerie wariness started to seep in Hilderich.
 At length he tapped at Amonas shoulder, who paused, turned and looked directly
 at Hilderich, an expectant look on his face but not a sound coming out
 of his lips.
 Hilderich asked in a low voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Are we lost?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas did not answer, but rather resumed his walk, taking them through
 caverns small and large and paths that could not be retraced unless with
 a map.
 The further down they went, the warmer it felt, and soon walking in the
 caves felt like a warm summer trip in the country.
 Hilderich had by now lost track of their approximate depth, direction,
 or distance of travel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps they were not lost, but he essentially was and thought he would
 be unable find his own way back if the opportunity presented itself.
 What good would it do though, since the tube was meant to go down, and
 not up? Just as he let out a sigh of hopelessness, he could discern light
 pouring out from the next corner, and feel their slight descend leveling
 out.
 By now his clothes felt almost dry, a slight feeling of dampness remaining
 in his feet and arms.

The light grew more intense, a clear intense light like sunlight.
 But sunlight, so deep under the earth? Not to mention, it was still night
 outside.
 When they were only a few paces away from the corner that shone with light,
 Amonas threw up one arm, palm open, indicating a halt.
 He leaned over the corner of the rocky cave, and peered carefully for almosta
 minute, making sure they were safe.
 Hilderich was not in a position to know what he was keeping them safe from,
 or whether or not the possible threat was imaginary or real.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded that everything seemed as it should be, and walked out into
 the light.
 He blinked his eyes flinching as they adjusted to the brightness, and then
 gestured with his hand to Hilderich:

Hilderich stepped forward as well, the bright light forcing him to instinctively
 cover his eyes with his right arm, the small peep of its shadow the only
 shelter against such sudden illumination.
 A fragrant waft of air rushed around them, as Philo joined them as well,
 and all three of them were slowly walking towards the light.
 As Hilderich's eyes finally adjusted to the light, he could see the rocky
 cave all around them give way to a smooth white surface, much like porcelain
 at first glance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These strange walls seemed to extrude themselves from the strata of cave
 rocks, as if totally alien and utterly old in origin.
 Then Hilderich's eyes wandered a bit more and then his gaze rested on the
 center of a huge chamber apparently made from the same white-ivory material.
 The chamber was cylindrical in shape, and from top to bottom a wide pillar
 which incredulously seemed to be made of pure light stood, a sight that
 defied Hilderich's senses and logic.

Hilderich was visibly shaken as if coming around from a waking dream, eyes
 rolling around trying to come to grips with his surroundings and the man
 with the gruff voice in front of him, shouting at him and looking ready
 to snap him in two if he said the wrong thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He asked him to think of the Mythos, and the Law.
 The Law was the established religious canon that had replaced traditional
 secular law thousands of years earlier.
 The Mythos was the recorded history of the Gods handing down the Law unto
 the forsaken race of man, to save it from destruction and withering, to
 help men reach their Gods at the Time of Conjugation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Law instructs man that those he knew as Ancients were the manifestation
 of evil.
 That any tool or work of art or science whose workings cannot be seen with
 the naked eye or touched by naked hand are containers of evil.
 That there is only this land, and none other.
 That the lights in the sky were put there by the Gods, to make nights more
 bearable.
 That death is irrevocable and permanent, and those who do not uphold the
 Law, will be shunt forever, their souls kept away from the Gods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That any man, woman or child upholding belief in the Ancients or their works
 is a heretic, a vessel of corruption.
 That the Ministers, uphold and teach the Law to the people.
 That the people, in turn, devote themselves and their lives to abide the
 Law.
 That the Patriarch declares additional Law as he sees fit, never in contradicti
on to the basic tenements, and he alone chooses his successor.
 That a Castigator rules, a man of wisdom and strength to lead the people,
 protect them, enlighten the heathens, punish the lawbreakers and the heretics,
 and offer praise and glory to the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is what the Mythos and the Law say.
 Hilderich, though he did not consider himself the religious type, had always
 been careful not to attract the ire of the Ministers.
 He had memorised the Mythos and the Law, as part of his training and education,
 as is the case with most who are fortunate enough to be allowed to read
 and write, since he was apprentice to a Curator, a guild of men with special
 dispensation to hold and maintain approved artifacts from times past, some
 of which have nefarious origins, keeping strict indices of what is stored
 where.

Hilderich was considering the magnificent simplicity and awesome sight of
 the pillar of light in front of him, a bright pillar of sunlight not as
 blinding as the suns, with a hazy rainbow of all colours on its edges,
 a pulsating haze of tiny pin pricks rushing through some sort of invisible
 shell.
 He was interrupted somewhat violently by Amonas who neatly but decisively
 pushed him towards the pillar of light.

The first thing that Hilderich felt was a sinking sensation, like the inevitable

 ships and men alike.
 Then he saw an explosion of light, swirling walls of light running up to
 meet him face on, and then nothing for what must have been less than a
 heartbeat.

Then light filled his senses totally, even his smell.
 He could have sworn, he could smell light.
 Then his eyes somewhat adjusted to the radiant sea of white enfolding him,

 The second was a gravely voice with serious undertones, Amonas' voice.

A man with no purpose in life is like a river without a sea to lose itself
 in.
 Such is the meaning of purpose, hard and defining, to lose oneself completely.
 Immerse one's essence in a journey with no visible end in the distance.
 Anything less is bound to bring about ennui, the crushing realisation of
 our discrete physical form and its inadequacies.
 Anything less than steering oneself through life like the only real obstacle
 is death itself, leads to early death of the mind and the soul.
 I ask you, would you live life or stand by idly waiting for death? I chose
 to vanquish death altogether.

\begin_layout Section
A long and winding path
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mountain grew ever more unkind.
 Its many bare faces looked down upon a lonely figure, slowly but surely
 making its way through rock, gravel, low grass and loose dirt.
 His hood was down, revealing a stern but humble face.
 Care lines dotted his forehead, and one could easily spot he was not a
 man prone to laughing easily.
 His face was adorned by a beard grown out of necessity, not choice, and
 his thin long hair was unkempt, a few wild strand jutting in strange directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wind and the rain were thankfully absent on this day, awarding him the
 leisure of trudging along the mountainous path with only his sore feet
 and stiff legs to distract him from his effort.
 Indeed, he paused once again to rest for a moment, let his blood flow freely
 in his legs and feet, and take a moment to pray to God for his good fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat down on the naked rock, his buttocks well used by now to such discomforts.
 He touched his forehead with one had and brought out a small piece of knotted
 string with the other.
 His lips then moved in a silent orison, asking for more of the same good
 fortune, and perhaps a bush or nut-bearing tree from which to gather some
 much needed food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had not seen or heard signs of goats or other mountain-dwelling animals
 for days now.
 There was still some grass on these slopes, so there should have been herds
 or families of animals feeding.
 Perhaps there were many more richer plains and slopes far below, or in
 plateaus his path had not taken him through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it was pure chance that he had not seen a living soul, neither a
 bird or lizard and certainly not a goat.
 Perhaps it was his God, testing him for purity of heart and strength of
 purpose, to steel him further in order to come through the always perilous
 journey of Pilgrimage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was living on certain kinds of insects that were still to be found if
 someone knew how and where to look, and a few roots he had been able to
 identify as edible.
 The further deep inside the mountain range he trod, the stranger and more
 different the life he met became.
 At first the trees started to become bulkier, more water rich, taller and
 greener.
 Then the animals, he noticed, were more stout, fatter, their meat sweet
 and richer in flavor, its color a vivid red, not like the dark, stringy
 meat of the animals he was used to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a sign, he decided, that with every step closer to God's Lands, the
 land was graced by his favor, and the animals were fat and felt no hunger,
 the trees and plants grew tall and proud, the birds soared high and their
 voices were sweet as honey running down a child's mouth.
 It was His work, all that was abundant, and all that was good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part of the mountains seemed to have fallen from His grace, whether
 as another trial, or for reasons only He could entertain.
 No matter, since his wisdom permeates the earth and the sky, he thought
 he could only accept and never wonder, for that way lay madness, and the
 fall from grace into pits of despair and malevolence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt he was attuned, resonating with the earth below, the sky above and
 the stone all around him.
 He reached into his small sack, and with no effort produced a small circular
 pendant, a thin slice of white marble or porcelain cast around a black
 mat surface, smoothe and cold to the touch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He held it firmly with both hands for a while, looking intently at its black
 surface and then a thin sliver of green started to pulsate on the black
 surface, a green line starting to form from one edge of the small black
 circlet, and ending on another, to form a straight path, like the invisible
 brush of a painter kept stroking the same line, always in the same direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at the thin, green line of light, and then looked at the faint
 mountain path that zig-zag through the ever rockier slopes.
 His path was true, that much he knew.
 His pointing stone had not failed him before, and neither would it fail
 him now, not on his Pilgrimage, not while his faith was strong, and his
 prayer warm of heart and soul.
 That he knew, and little else would come to matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a moment and gazed at the lands resting below him.
 The great northern plains could be seen far away, a faint grey haze slightly
 discernible under a thin sheet of fog.
 And then rolling hills of auburn slowly lifting off the ground as if the
 very hand of God had touched and pinched the lands, his handprint faintly
 echoed in the timid, graceful slopes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the foot of the mountains and the hills, lay a deep gorge, a wild
 river running through it, twisting and turning as far as the eye could
 see further to the east, its flow coming from somewhere deep inside the
 mountains, further up north, further than the lands where his people roam,
 where the snow never melts and the suns always hide behind the clouds,
 where neither man nor beast can endure for long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fleeting sensation of wonder filled him, for the works of God were magnificent
 to behold, and his Pilgrimage a unique journey of faith, beauty, wonder
 and duty.
 The honour he was blessed with was indeed so great he could have never
 thought it possible, much less aspire to it.
 Nonetheless, he was on a Pilgrimage to the Land of God.
 He was the Pilgrim, the one honoured to pay homage to the Land of God and
 the final resting place of their forefathers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To him lay the duty of bringing back a Holy Forge, to pluck one out of the
 very famed Garden of Wonders! His eyes were suddenly lit at the very thought,
 even as his body still dully ached from the many hardships his peregrination
 had knowingly brought upon him and would bring him still.
 But he ignored all that which occluded his mind and he imagined himself,
 standing amidst the Garden of Wonders and quenching his thirst from the
 Unending Spring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would all be more than worthy of the pain, the cold and the rain.
 Just to lay his eyes on the Veiled Gates, he would willingly give his life.
 But he cannot, and will not, until his Pilgrimage is complete, and his
 people have their Holy Forge renewed.
 Oh, the joyous wonders he is yet to behold, not just the earth and the
 rivers and the mountains all wrought in unquestioned wisdom, but the craft
 of God Himself, right in front of his eyes, at the touch of his hand, from
 silver, and stone, and sand that never crumbles, or faints, and never shall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His senses brought him back to the cold reality.
 He still had some good light left, and he should not waste it.
 Every day without a Holy Forge was a harsh day for his people.
 His journey was still many days and nights away from an end.
 Tarrying here in the middle of the mountains, daydreaming like a young
 selfish brat was not at all what any would expect of him, the one so honoured.
 His shoulders suddenly felt a bit heavier with so much resting on them:
 the future of his people, the life of the land, the children yet unborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gust of the mountains cold and wholesome air seemed to have infected him
 with renewed vigour.
 In seconds, he was already steadily climbing up the steep, winding path
 that would take him between the two dominant mountain peaks, and afterwards
 probably on a shallow descend to the Land of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who had gone before him had followed the same path, and had passed
 on word of their travel and their journey.
 What mountains and ridges to pass, which rivers and springs to drink from,
 what strange growths and roots to eat, where to feel safe and sleep unhindered,
 as well as where to keep one eye open and your knife in hand.
 More than a few had perished and left traces of their demise for the next
 ones to follow, and more than a few times the people had almost been extinguish
ed, their last footprint upon the earth carried away by the winds that know
 no sympathy or heed no pledge and care not for the lives of simple men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But God provides, and always will.

\begin_layout Standard
These thoughts occupied his head as he toiled onwards, even though under
 his thick pelted boots his calloused feet could feel every last jut of
 rock and bit of gravel.
 This was him now, this described him wholly.
 He was Pilgrim, meant to walk the earth until he reached the Holy Place,
 and then whether or not he would go back to his people and his previous
 life, that meant nothing.
 When he performed the Rites, the Holy Forge would be with his people.
 And then he could walk back, and live the rest of his days having witnessed
 the glory of God, teach those that would come after him, and if it fate
 would have it so, help the next Pilgrim prepare for his own difficult journey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, he thought, I am getting too far ahead in my thinking.
 My journey is still far from over, and yet here I am, feet dead as wood,
 legs heavy like rock, once again on the climb, all I've loved and known

 a future yet to unravel, me at its centre.

Selfishness.

 A sign of malignancy, a precursor to evil thoughts and desires, accursed

 May God watch over his people and lend him strength and clarity of mind

 To think such thoughts, when God was already pointing to the true path,
 when everything so far had proceeded along according to his divine plan,
 when the auguries had said it was a good time for a Pilgrimage.
 That he was a good man, that he would be a true Pilgrim, one tat God would
 accept.

He felt he had to cleanse himself with birch and water, pay obeysance to
 his God with an offer of personal sacrifice.
 But he was already on his Pilgrimage, what could he do now that would not
 interfere with his holy purpose? He had no inkling yet, but he felt blood
 rushing through his veins, feeling guilty, shameful, almost soiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pushed harder, the slope turning into an almost sheer wall of rock.
 The small, narrow path had degenerated into a granite crevace with pockmarks
 and surfaces of chipped rock that one had to climb with hands as well as
 feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his mind, it mattered little, because he felt like he would grow wings
 if he had to, if the earth was without warning removed from his feet.
 He felt like he would grow gills and scales, and swim the oceans of the
 world if the skies suddenly opened and poured all the water of the world
 and the earth was covered in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He steadily put one hand after the next, hoisting his lithe and supple careworn
 body slowly but surely, every step of the way a small death for Them and
 their venomous influence that seeps into the hearts and minds of the weak-minde
d and unfaithful, spreading over the poeple of the earth like a rotting
 disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perspiration glistened on his forehead, the small of his back was damp as
 well, everu muscle and joint burning from effort and protesting at every
 leap and move.
 But he kept going, his mind focused, his soul shielded and armed, a searing
 force of pure light stabbing through a heart of darkness, a pestilence
 of lies, deceit and wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was fighting Them, even as he climbed, and sweat, and toiled.
 His whole Pilgrimage was a Holy War, he now knew, and this very climb a
 fight.
 Like the War between God and Them, at a time before man.
 The same war, a million fights, a million more, until God prevails, until
 the faithful have had their share of blood, toil, and fighting.
 Until then, he would climb for his people, His Faithful.
 Until then, he would endure the forces arrayed against him, be they nature,
 men, or Them, in one disguise or many.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would endure and he would prevail.
 Not to become a revered one among his folk, not to serve some delusional
 idea of a grandiose self in a small world and an even smaller land, an
 even fewer people.
 It was true, their numbers were dwindling, their women bore less children,
 and their liver were becoming shorter.
 He would endure the hardships of his path and the machinations of the enemies
 of God, for the good of his people and the will of his God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He reached out with one hand blindly, his face wearing an expression of
 determination, a resolute, stout mask under which nerves flickered furiously
 with jabbing explosions of pain and anguish, though for no one else to
 know apart himself and God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He grasped for a handhold in the rock, a fissure, a jutting piece of granite
 or lime, but all he could grasp was thin, cold rushing air.
 With another leap, his face was caught in the stream of air, his hood wildly
 fluttering about his neck, sweaty locks of hair caressing his face.
 He had reached the neck between the two peaks, and he could now see a wide
 stretch of plain-like ground extending before him, grim patches of grass,
 rocks and dusty gravel for days worth of travel ahead of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could feel the touch of God as he took the final step onto the plateau,
 his soul drifted away by a divine wind, his aching body forgetful of his

 He felt light as a feather, in body and soul.
 He remembered then the words of his Guide, his people's master of lore
 and faith, their holy man:

Indeed then his path was true, one of many perils left behind.
 He let out a laugh, inspite of him, a laugh he would look down on with
 contempt as blasphemous, but it was a laugh that welled from the soul,
 a liberating act, a cry of thanks to his God, his protector, his ever watchful
 Father.
 He started walking with a steady slow pace once more, with what little
 light of day remained guiding him to a cluster of rocks where he might
 find shelter for the coming night.
 Once he lay down, he would pray to God and offer him his gratitude for
 saving him from disgrace and keeping him on his true path.

Celia woke up as the beam of sunlight characteristically bounced off the
 gleaming, copper-skinned Ministry tower, as was usually the case.
 Her long golden brown hair, tangled as it was from last night's fretful

 ministry's tower shone upon her.
 Her visage was one of a fiery, avenging god-maiden of fury and destruction,

But that was only a fleeting impression, for when she touched her grown

 moment of time, a mother's smile, a power beyond reckoning and imagination,
 all that in the creases of a beautiful face and two comely lips.
 And she who had seemed as a terrible force had been wondrously transfigured,
 into a mother bathed in sunlight, radiating warmth and love, any hint of
 terrible awe a mere phantom now in the eye of the beholder.

After a few moments of silent contemplation, as if communicating with the

 she took her morning bath, and then offered her own prayer to the Gods,

She was then startingly taken by the fragrant smell that had gently occupied

 She peered over her stone balcony, more and more people starting to wade

 Who would dare cross arms with the Law? Much less for a little taste of
 sugar.
 And Cerpiem, the stall vendor, who sold almost anything from thin sheets
 of writing paper for the rich and affluent, to small pieces of gum for
 the children.
 He had nothing of the sorts laid out.

Who was the mischievous rascal then? And even more so, ignoring the proscription

She put on her simple flowing green dress, the silver hairband Amonas had

She knew Amonas would be somewhere here in the city of Pyr, but it was much
 safer for both of them if she knew not exactly where he was and when he
 would be coming back.
 It was for the best, that was what he had told her, and she felt suddenly
 saddened by his absence, staying away from each other while he could be
 so close was stressful and felt plain wrong.
 Like a child instructed not to play for fear of falling down and hurting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was suddenly brought back to her immediate reality in a breathtakingly
 surprising way: a hefty slice of cinnamon breadpie was standing right in
 fron of her, and old lady Rovenia was holding the outlandishly little plate,
 a knowing smile written across her care-worn face, bright green eyes that
 had seen more than a lifetime's worth of sadness and happiness twinkling
 with a child's mischievous glee.

 Rovenia through the footstep of her house's door, which she had barely
 walked out from herself only moments earlier.
 Lady Rovenia said nothing, but kept on smiling, and Celia thought she could
 perhaps hear a little snort or giggle as the old lady came inside the house,
 with a breadpan full of hot sweetness and fresh aroma carried under her
 arms.

\begin_layout Standard
Celia broke down in laughter which was not easily contained and as an added
 trouble, a morcel of breadpie still being chewed was inadvertently stuck
 between her stomach and her mouth, prompting her to start coughing fervently,
 but at the same time, folding herself across her belly as much as her situation
 permitted, laughing, choking, and coughing at the same time, if that was
 at all possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lady Rovenia was dumbstruck at Celia's reaction but she was quick to act
 as well.
 She found a small alcove on Celia's kitchen wall to set the still warm
 breadpan, and then hurried to the drinking bucket, and poured a large cup
 of water for Celia to wash the troubling piece of food down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia, still trying to recover from her attack of hysterical laughter, and
 still coughing, took the proferred cup of water, and drank in large gulps.
 Some of the water ran down her cheeks and neck, some of it she spluttered
 while coughing, but most of it washed the breadpie down, and she could
 safely breathe again, now laughing because of the way she nearly choked.
 Lady Rovenia seemed terrified, a pale look of worry drawn all over her
 small wrinkled face, but managed to say in a quavering voice full of concern:

\begin_layout Standard
And with that they passed the time until the evening arrived, exchanging
 stories and tales, but mostly Rovenia telling her the story of her life
 in many small parts, whatever little story she felt most appropriate at
 any time, whether it be funny, sad, or in some curious circumstances, both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia was drawn to the old woman's tales like a kitten to warm milk.
 At first she sipped them slowly, and then drank them all in as if catering
 for an insatiable desire to listen to everyday tales of an old midwife
 and caring neighbour.
 Celia thought old Rovenia would be quite fitting for the task, and the
 old woman lovingly knocked her door from time to time to check how she
 was doing, if her health was anything less than adamant, and if the baby
 kicked and felt lively enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From time to time she scolded her for not taking good care of herself, not
 eating enough quality meat, and there never seemed to be enough greens

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She insisted on Celia eating lots of eggs and milk if she could cope with
 it on a daily basis, and drink lots of uwe, said to be good for everything,
 from the blood to the bones.
 And when the child would stirr troubled, the best medicine would be to
 sing to it, sing from her heart, whatever soothed and pleased her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the old lady finally left the house, it was more from polite awareness
 of the time that had melted away from the hearty discussion, almost like
 one between an anxious soon-to-be grandmother and her pregnant daughter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia had never known her mother, and her father was killed in the Pacification
 of Zaelin, little enough to understand almost nothing around her, but old
 enough to remember her father kissing her goodbye for the last time, his
 kiss at once somber and warm to the touch.
 She had grown up with her grandparents, who loved her more than possible
 and raised her better than a daughter.
 They had died before they could see her wed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia offered the old lady to stay for the rest of the day, provide her
 valuable insight and experience in cooking the next day's meal, but Rovenia
 said it was unhealthy for the baby to stay inside for long, and that she
 should definetely go on a walk while there was still any sunlight left,
 since nighttime in Pyr was less than a proper place for an expecting woman,
 the light of the lamps leaving more to the shadow than seemed wise and
 proper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, like most ladies at her age, she would retire in the warmth of her small
 house, and pass the time weaving jedoons and other pieces of cloth that
 might come in handy, or not.
 And then she laughed briefly but genuinely, and went next door, leaving
 Celia to tend to her own household in peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She did just that for some time, idling away at brooming and cleaning the
 house as much as her straining back allowed, and then she brought firewood
 from their small cellar, and paused for a while before starting a fire
 anew for tomorrow's meal, perhaps some stew, perhaps a broth of beans and
 greens, a recipe Rovenia had suggested while they were idly gnawing at
 her breadpie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She stood with a few small pieces of firewood cupped into her arms, when
 the thought flashed in her head unwanted: she was out of uwe, again! She
 left the tiny logs aside on the small kitchen table and went upstairs to
 fetch her small purse of coins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She then made sure she hadn't actually started off an untended fire, drew
 her broadly-hemmed cloak around her and darted off towards the market,
 light waning, the falling dusk painting the distant encircling hills in
 an orange and purple hue, some of the rooftops in Pyr shedding a brown-yellow
 sheen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The city crowd on the streets was shifting towards its nocturnal aspect,
 the ones that rarely venture outside if the suns still abound, and rarely
 crawl back to their domiciles before dawn is about to break.
 Loud song and cheers, sounds of merrymaking and laughter could be heard
 at least once in every street that she passed on her way to Ves, the farmer
 she knew was her kin, a cousin in fact, and tried not to fool her like
 others in the market did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She wasn't sure if she would make it in time, for at this hour Ves as well
 as almost everyone else with farms or animals to tend, had to leave for
 his farmstead, eat and rest, before getting up in the middle of the night,
 watering whatever plants needed so, then harvesting those ready for the
 market, and then loading up his cart and off he would be to the market
 once more to make some coin, for his wife and children not to beg like
 some who were cast adrift in the unfathomable torrents of fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She could see them, dishevelled beings, sometimes indistinguishable from
 animals, sometimes bringing a sore tear to her eyes.
 Some she helped as she could, a loaf of bread or her daily bottle of milk.
 Sometimes she would leave a plate of fodd for those that drifted throughout
 the city and did not just await their end at some dark corner of the market,
 either stamped upon, trodden by mistake or not, sometimes hunted as a passtime
 by men drunk enough or too clearheaded to care as they ended their horrid
 lives, bringing on a fate only fit for nightmares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she turned the last corner before she reached Ves' usual stand, she could
 see she was too late, Ves as well as everyone else having departed for
 the night, leftover fruit and vegetable stalks amassing on the cobbled
 streets, a sour acrid odor wafting all around her.
 If nothing else at all, she had indeed taken a walk, though at an inappropriate
 hour, and she should be getting home before long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she turned around to start walking back towards her house, she was frozen
 where she lay, when a mailed hand seemed to stretch from utterly nowhere,
 some shadowy crevice, some chasm in a wall she hadn't noticed in her dimly
 lit surroundings, a surreptitious figure that seemed well-disposed towards
 her, or else she would be already lying in a pool of her blood, for what
 little coin she carried in her tiny purse, or things worse than an untimely
 death that she dared not imagine while carrying her child still in her
 womb.

Hilderich was picking ineffectually at the withering bark of a large oak-like
 tree, swarms of ants running up and down its length, tiny flecks of dead
 wood on their backs.
 The tree was turning into ashes, returning into the dirt, one very small
 piece at a time.
 Hilderich was quite fascinated by what he was seeing all around him and
 that was probably why he had not broken down in hysterical cries because
 of their mishap.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which was also why he could blame Amonas for their predicament, in a steady,
 calm, matter-of-factly and somewhat detached, distant tone of voice.
 Half his mind was infuriated, close to bursting actually, because Amonas
 seemed to have had inadvertently stranded them on 
\shape slanted

\shape default
The other half of his mind was trying to make connections between the flora
 and fauna of this general area, place, whatever one might call it, and
 the various curatoria he believed he remembered having some kind of relation
 in part or in whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indirectly, this was Hilderich's way of coping with the problem in hand,
 partly to offset his mind and unburden it from stress, anxiety, and generally
 what he had learned to consider counter-productive emotions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on top of that, he was actually trying to help in his own lateral way,
 by trying to identify anything he might be able to, based on whatever curatoria
 he had studied or seen in his unfortunately short and, recent events not
 withstanding, uneventful apprenticeship.
 It seemed that apart from superficial resemblances and some generic common
 traits, he had arrived at no particularly useful conclusion.
 For the time being, he reminded himself silently and thoughtfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was sitting at a partly exposed root of a gigantic kind of a tree
 he had trouble accepting that was real, even though he had been sitting
 right there, on the same spot, for the better part of an hour, silent,
 thoughtful and certainly perplexed, even though Hilderich had spared little
 of the last hour discussing with Amonas, or simply looking at the man's
 face, which would be enough for the even the most socially inept, slow-witted
 and sentimentally detached human to understand the man was deeply troubled,
 almost morose, and not without good cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insects abounded in this humid environment, the likes of which he had not
 known existed, not even in the southern-most bogs and marshes.
 Sweat poured from their bodies incessantly, making their every movement
 a sticky, messy business.
 It was the heat.
 The heat of desert combined with the water, the moisture, of a lake or
 river.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had seen no river whatsoever from the top of the hill where they had
 emerged, and had come upon no body of water in their blind search so far.
 The humidity and heat of the place was overwhelming; Amonas thought they
 should devote most of their time and effort into simply staying alive for
 the time being.
 That meant finding a source of clean, fresh water, preferably by nightfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' mind buzzed incessantly with the same thought; it was indeed his
 fault.
 Hilderich had been right.
 His initial purpose when pushing Hilderich into that infernal pillar of
 light, that machinery truly in its makers' image, was to force him to see
 the truth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time he himself had stepped through that beacon of light, he had
 been instantly transferred into a huge, deep cavern, walls of solid metal
 jutting out of the bedrock, an incomprehensible labyrinth of large metal

 constructs the likes of which he could not believe were made by mere men,
 but rather by Gods, or their offspring or servants.

He had seen words in High Helican he had not seen before, dangling in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had seen so much more he needed to forget as well, but could not, in
 fact, dared not forget, lest the hatred for their jailers, captors, these

No such euphemism of words like dictator, or killer, would really suffice

\begin_layout Standard
Without knowing, he seemed to have been gripping his knife from its blade,
 so intensely he had cut himself, a small rivulet of blood and sweat running
 down his wrist, droplets of rosy red falling down onto the constantly wet

 Ever thirsty and never quenched, be it blood, water or both, these new
 lands seemed to feed on desperation and sweat.
 His focus returned to the immediate reality around them and felt the sagging
 weight of the situation.

He had to have faith in himself: he was a man of action, and he had already

He looked up to the alien looking sky, so familiar but so different at the
 same time.
 He could remember his days of ignorance and blissful youth, riding in the
 countryside, galloping fast and hard as if the world's end was rushing
 right behind him.
 And the sky had this strange quality, a light blur, a haze of wonder, looking
 as if it was a mere ceiling he could reach up and touch as long as he wished
 it hard enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would not perish here, he decided.
 It was as simple as that.
 He would keep his promises and find his way back, to make things right.
 To free his fellow men.
 To live life anew, reborn.
 As fresh and innocent as his firstborn would be.
 It was time to act, secure any means of survival in this strange land,
 acclimatise themselves quickly, for who knew how long their journey back
 would take, and have faith, in themselves, and their purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be Hilderich's now as well, even though he cannot yet grasp the
 extend of the lies, deceit, and exploitation.
 He should be able to put Hilderich to some good use as well; the man who
 was a little older than a mere boy had good qualities.
 He was smart and perceptive, suspicious but not predisposed, simple but
 not simple-minded.
 He would be fine.
 They would be fine.
 After they worked out some of the issues involved, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suns were wrong, for starters.
 There was only one sun here, and it seemed brighter than usual, but smaller,
 the hue of its light an almost lime green.
 And then there were the towers, or spirals, he wasn't sure how to describe
 them.
 Hideously tall and thin towers in pairs, a low crescent shape adjoining
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They kind of reminded him of bull horns, if he had to describe them more
 plainly.
 Far away in the distance, were the haze allowed it, they could make out
 not one of these monumentally proportioned constructs, but a dozen or more,
 in regular intervals.
 They were fascinating, but largely irrelevant at this point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had thought about broaching these matters to Hilderich, but he decided
 against that for now.
 The detailed intricacies of their whereabouts, their actual location, the
 climate and topography of the region, were merely academic issues if they
 would not provide a small shred of actual information that would lead them
 to somehow going back to Pyr, or any recognisable place for that matter,
 in the Territories or elsewhere in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was still absorbed in thought, eyes piercing the tall canopy of thick
 foliage, the huge volume of the surrounding trees standing like rocky pillars

 their return, and the other, the heavenly shell of a world that they were
 yet to reach, the world back home, their haven.

Hilderich was shouting now, still thinking Amonas was day-dreaming or far

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was genuinely surprised at such behavior.
 Had Amonas been catatonic, he would never really respond and then he would
 be left alone, and with his survival skills and his latest round of luck,
 perish in this steamy cauldron.
 If he was indeed mad, he probably go berserk and snap his neck like a twig
 if he was lucky enough.
 It seemed now that he was neither.
 He was simply, as strange as it seemed to Hilderich at the time, hard at
 thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat down in front of Amonas, on the leaf strewn ground, wet and muddy,
 a continuous hint of rotting vegetation waxing and waning from the faint

 Hilderich cleared his throat and while still looking at the ground, toying
 around with a small branch, idly looking at the ground, he asked with some
 reluctance:

Amonas bit his lip and answered, palms outstretched, an ornate ring of silver

 He seemed to draw some breath, then pausing briefly as if he intended to
 say otherwise before nodding in acceptance and telling Hilderich:

It's real Hilderich.
 That is what has dragged me down in thought.
 I am sorry Hilderich, my intentions were quite different, and certainly

 I know I have failed you so far Hilderich, so I will promise you nothing.
 I can only offer you my help in order to find a way home.
 Preferably, while we still draw breath.

 at the thick foliage, hoping to catch a glimpse of the strangely immaculate,
 perfectly cloudless sky.

When Amonas looked down again, he noticed Hilderich had fallen on his back
 giggling almost maniacally, his knees bent haplessly in a comical angle,
 arms folded across his chest, hands clapping with the whole of his palms.
 Amonas frowned quizzically, Hilderich's bizarre reaction to his statement
 leaving him unable to understand or much less respond at all.

Hilderich sat upright, legs sprawled in an uncomfortable position, his hand
 pointing at his own face in sheer disbelief, his voice a falcetto.
 His face looked suddenly harsh, unforgiving, out of place with his normal

 a calm and studied manner, as if lecturing a man of lesser intelligence:

Not to insinuate that you have done a very poor job so far, but please,
 indulge me.
 How can you, help me, find a way home.
 Are you perhaps a magician of the old tales? I think not dear friend, since
 then you would be in posession of a cone-shaped hat, talking gibberish
 even while you sleep, though I cannot yet vouch for the verity or not of
 that particular supposition.
 Another possible way in which you might be of help would be that you are,
 in fact, a fallen angel of the Gods, who has yet to use his superlative
 powers in my favor because he is as ever trying to teach me a lesson in
 humility and religious awe, lest my soul is eternally condemned in Catharteria,
 Damnation, the Twelve Wheels of Fire and so on.
 You seem to be missing your wings, shield, divine aura, and angelic face,
 so I would say no, you can't help me like that.
 I briefly considered that you might actually own this particular piece
 of land and are indeed 
\shape slanted

 to offload it to a dimwhitted fool like myself who might mistake the extreme
 humidity, unbearable heat and overflowing vegetation for marshlands suitable
 for cotton, or something equally senile.
 Without trying to hurt your feelings or vested interests in a manner most
 ungracious, I regret to inform you I find your selling points lacking and
 will not be following up on your offer.
 Now, unless I am mistaken in all of the above, and unless you have some
 button or pillar of light that does the opposite of what brought us here,
 I dare say we are properly doomed, and good as dead and finished.
 Other more vulgar expressions pertaining to our present unfortunate situation
 come to mind, but I will not bring myself down to such inestimable depths
 of bad taste and linguistic ineptitude to use them like a debased wretch
 of lesser stature.
 I will now honestly state my predilections, one, that I wish to hang myself
 at the nearest opportune moment in order to escape further unneeded physical
 torment under these circumstances, and two, that I wish for my remains
 to be burned, as is customary under Law.

All that Amonas could do, was blink, wide-eyed and at a loss for words.

 an air of finality around him, as if a holy avatar had announced the end

Hilderich, I'm sure we'll have quite some time to exchange more tales.
 But we have to attend to our survival first.
 We will need fresh, drinking water.
 And something solid to eat, surely.
 Something that will not easily spoil in this heat and moisture, this unlikely
 combination of marsh and forest.
 But our priority should be water.
 At the rate we sweat, we will surely suffer the most from its lack.
 And too soon for comfort, I would wager.
 Speaking of which, have you noticed? The shadows, they are strange.

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded, then looked carefully around them, at the barks of trees
 and small rocks and hanging green overgrowths.
 He looked at what one would call a glenn if it weren't for the awfully
 wrong conditions and the green overarching roof made from ostensibly ancient
 tree branches.
 The canopy was a mosaic of green and brown hues, the greenish light of
 the sun adding an emerald glare to the columns of light that shot underneath,
 where Hilderich could see, the shadows stood still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, he noticed that the shadows had moved little or not at all since
 earlier.
 He couldn't be sure, but he knew it was at least strange, and probably
 another indication that they were very, very, far away from home.

 casting its shadow on a peculiar half-grey, half-bleached stone.

I would say about noon.
 But I could be mistaken.
 A few hours ago, before we reached this place, night was well under way.
 And then when we came here, it seemed like a bright summer day, the sun

 My body and mind long for rest, my sense of time should be in disarray.

 noon.

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas frowned, but did not press the issue.

Tha shadows during the day are cast because of the suns' light.
 So, when the suns move across the sky, so do the shadows follow in hand

 Would the suns stay still, so would the shadows.
 It is not entirely without logic to postulate that since we have witnessed
 only one sun, this is perhaps the reason for its inability to move, and
 hence the standing shadows and the continuous moon.

If that comes to be, then the heat will not dissipate, and this will go

Hilderich was seemingly more humorous than before, and his words were not
 to be taken for granted, but Amonas had to admit to the fact that this
 strange sun and taxing climate would make their efforts even more strained
 and difficult that he had calculated.
 And still he feared, they had no solid idea of how to get back home.
 Survival would have to take precedence.
 And that meant finding water, not sooner or later, but immediately.

Under different circumstances that would involve my absence, I would be

I'm not very excited at what you are suggesting, but I cannot think of anything

 imperceptibly condescending sort of nod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few hours passed, Amonas grinding their way through ever thicker vegetation,
 now stripped naked to the waist, the heat and humidity insufferable to
 bear with his leather vest and chain mail underneath that.
 Hilderich wondered at how the man had suffered to carry all that weight
 at all, never mind wearing all that in such conditions, and only choosing
 not to when after they had been walking for the better part of an hour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed as if the man had grown literally attached to his set of armor,
 or that its prolonged use had left indelible stains on his body.
 None of those reasons, it seemed, stood to reason.
 Amonas had simply not taken them off because he hadn't felt inclined to.
 That probably spoke volumes for the man's tolerance threshold, and what
 he was capable of going through if pressed, but Hilderich thought he had
 no desire to learn, since he believed this whole experience would be if
 nothing else, extremely educational and vividly remembered if there was
 any afterwards to be had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas seemed to indefatigable.
 He had trod on through thickset lush overgrowths, greens and all sorts
 of wild vegetation using his indispensable knife, and had complained neither
 for the steaming heat or the breath-clogging moisture.
 Hilderich had refrained from asking questions about the reasoning behind
 their apparently random course through this probably impossible to map
 land, lacking great physical characteristics easily identifiable, used
 as points of reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except those twin towers, or bull horns, or giant forks or whatever one

 They were roughly headed towards the general direction of one of those
 structures.
 Structures that mere men could not have wrought, but would have had if
 they could.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich felt Amonas was not unreasonably excited about his finding, but
 he could not readily share the joy.
 His feet though he did not complain were hurting, and his feet were a soggy
 affair, not the least bit dry.
 His light boots had let all the moisture in, and their path had guided
 him through many mud-soaked footings.
 He could feel his skin was not up to the task, and he looked miserable
 to the bone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, finding water was the first good thing that had happened ever since
 that fine uwe stew, and that previous day seemed like another age alltogether.
 He managed a defiant smile which he hoped Amonas would not misunderstand,
 and carried himself to the small trickling water source where Amonas was
 washing his face.

Finally then.
 My mouth feels like a Ministry's rug, like everyone's trod on it!

 water running down through an old tree's bark, like someone had fashioned
 it specifically for that purpose.
 Luck it would seem, hadn't run dry just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After they had managed to wash away some of the sweat and grit, and more
 importantly, quench their thirst and fill their belly with more than water
 than it could handle, Amonas took Hilderich by the arm and suggested to
 him that they should try and make some sort of camp here, near the water.
 The rain would be coming, he said, even with the sun above, since there
 can be no water with no rain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they would have to keep dry, since that was how many folk in the sea
 died, their bodies found almost dried out, dessicated, husks rather than
 flesh.
 It was because water was attracted to water, and the water in the body,
 the blood, the piss, the spit, all that water was drawn away, to the river,
 or sea, or whatever larger body of water you happened to be in.
 The rich got richer, even in nature, perhaps even in this weird land as
 well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, Amonas had convinced Hilderich that it was wiser to stay dry,
 and it would be indeed a welcome change in any case.
 They would have to build a fire to do that, and with all that humidity
 everywhere, he could not for the life of him figure out how, but they had
 found water, so they would build a fire too.
 Or so Amonas said.
 He was very convincing, Hilderich reassured himself before feeling unmistakably
 hungry, his stomach sounding like a cauldron on fire with nothing inside
 the broth but water.
\end_layout

I haven't seen a breathing thing yet, only biting insects and that's no

 Besides, it wouldn't be worth it.
 No real river or stream to try and find fish.
 We'll have to rely on you then, Hilderich.
 Try and find some kind of root, stem or plant in general you think might
 be safe to eat.
 I don't mean taste good, Hilderich.
 I really mean, eating it won't kill us, not right off anyway.
 I know I can leave you to it while I gather what wood and fiber I can manage
 to start working on that small tent of ours.
 Have faith in yourself Hilderich, we'll get back.

 inclined more rather than ordered and pushed around.
 It was the voice of a leader, Hilderich realised, a man fit for the task
 at hand: keeping people basically alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded, accepting the task though as with most tasks, not knowing
 if he was really up to it.
 He turned though once before starting to rummage through the thickset leaves

Amonas went about making a make-shift tent, and Hilderich finding something
 edible.
 Within less than half an hour, Amonas had laid down a few logs, half rotten

 He had stacked them so as to make a simple crude roof, and then covered
 that simple skeleton with snapped off fresh branches and twigs, and overlaid
 huge thick leaves from the innumerable plants available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He hoped these would suffice, and once he had massed enough pieces of wet
 yet not soggy wood, he piled it down neatly in a firestack, wishing his
 flint and stone would be enough to get the fire going.
 He called out to Hilderich, to check if he had found anything.
 While he received no reply for a few moments, the moment he started to
 feel worried about his whereabouts, Hilderich popped out of a cluster of
 bushes, with what seemed an armful of fine large mushrooms.

The suns seemed to have risen earlier on that day, or at least the Castigator's
 people definetely had.
 At every level of office and hierarchy, the living mechanisms of the Ministry,
 the Army and the Procastinators were of singular mind and purpose.
 The Castigator had announced that in two weeks time the wrathful military
 might of the Outer Territories would be ready to march for war.
 Something that had not happened in the past 25 years.

\begin_layout Standard
In every single office and chamber of the various organisations of people
 and ruling institutions, the situation was almost the same, if one would
 take into account the multitude of minor variations in disciplinary strictness,
 interpersonal roles and affiliations, as well as structural differences
 and the specific nomenclature of each branch of service.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lesser officials busied themselves with arranging communiques, writing down
 orders and manifests, then calling for couriers or perhaps taking it upon
 themselves to forward the appropriate documents and even materiel to their
 intended recipients.
 It would be anathema to any one in that overwhelmingly complex machine
 of sorts that he should singularly fail in the most simple of orders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If anything were to happen to this whole enterprise, this majestic war footing,
 this Holy Campaign, issued by the Gods, commanded by the Castigator himself,
 then it would not be because a lowly clerk or young lieutenant forgot to
 sent out some materiel recquisition form, or a call-to-arms teller.
 And indeed, if this Campaign was to fail because of a human error, in such
 a catastrophic way, before it even began to put itself into motion, everyone
 performed beyond their absolute best to ensure that it would not be on
 their account, on their watch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diligence was considered a virtuous characteristic, and most Law-abiding
 parents tried to hammer that into their children if they had to, so as
 to become proper people, upholding the Law whenever they could, serving
 from any place in society they might reach up to.
 Those that the Gods seemed to favor most, were selected to enter public
 service, either as Ministers, Procastinators, or Army men, according to
 how well they performed at the Agogeia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select officials from these three embodiments of rule and order taught at
 the Agogeia, schools for those that could afford to become something useful
 in their lives.
 Once the basics such as obedience to Law, reciting scripture, and fairly
 simple counting and swordfighting skills were taught, the best of each
 class of children were selected according to the inclination, receptiveness,
 and skill they showed at the various tests and games carried out for the
 very same purpose of separating the wheat from the chaff, those capable
 of serving the people and the Gods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some, those better skilled in memory, oration, the use of language and emotion,
 capable of swaying their fellow students to their own purpose, were further
 trained to become Ministers, further trained into the teachings and trappings
 of Law, how to best interpret Law according to need, how to teach, enlighten,
 and chastise laymen, and how to impress and guide hundreds if not thousands
 of people as Law, Ministry, and Ruling Council dictated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They would be responsible for the enlightenment of the people, teaching
 them the Law, and helping them avoid the temptations that would lead to
 blasphemy, heresy, casting out, eternal damnation, and a most probably
 gruesome, demeaning execution that would serve as a reminder and a lesson
 that All is Law, and noone and nothing is above it.
 The Ministers would also tend to the daily running of the Territories,
 as administrative officials, collecting offerings, making amendments to
 the lesser decrees of the Law to better handle the multitude of people
 and the realities of land of the living required, with its economy, trade,
 and needs.

The spending of coin for public works would be decided and then dispersed
 accordingly to those noble houses that could field enough manpower to make
 it happen, like roads, bridges, canals, buildings, walls, mills and workshops
 and every other resource that would the Territories grow and prosper, for
 the glory of the Pantheon.
 And one of their number would be chosen from the Castigator, with the blessings
 of the Patriarch, to be the next Archminister, the one blessed to be the
 voice and heart of the Ministry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those of the Agogeia students who were energetic, athletic students, showing
 exceptional stamina and strength, exemplifying martial prowess with the
 blade and their bare hands, those who were blessed with possessing a sharp
 decisive mind, had proven to be of faith unfailing and a stone hard dedication
 to the Pantheon, those were chosen as fit for service in the Army.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigorous training in all the known aspects of warfare was their only occupation
 until death, whether or not they were called upon to act, kill or be killed
 in service to the Gods, they would train with sword and spear, shield and
 horse, until old age came, when they would carry on with training others
 of their kind, in matters such as the planning and design of warfare where
 a mind should be much more fit than the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their training started with single combat techniques, with many different
 weapons, under different situations and varying levels of duress.
 Then they progressed into squad tactics, in the open field, against other
 types of units, like cavalry, or steamers and artillery.
 And then they would rotate into the rest of the units, for their training
 to be complete and be able to use everything from their empty hands to
 a complex steamer machine, and be knowledgeable in the weakness and strength
 of each one, being able to select the best course of action and what kind
 of men, machine or animal it would require to be successful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These were the core lessons they were taught: strength in knowledge, success
 in adaptability, glory in death.
 As they progressed through the standings of the Army, always according
 to their merit and degree of success in their duties, always keeping in
 mind their faithful devotion, through their accrued experience they learned
 more about handling men, materiel, and equipment, organisation, designing
 and planning with tens of thousands in mind, as one day they might be called
 upon to lead the whole Army as Generals, in the name of the Pantheon first,
 and the Castigator second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those that did not excel in anything, but showed average skill at wielding
 a sword, and could learn enough of the Law as needed orally, those did
 not learn to read and write like the Minister's did, nor train further
 in order to excel into combat.
 These children were strictly chosen for their ability to follow the letter
 of the Law, blindly, unerringly, keep a watchful eye for signs of heresy
 and insubordination, any element that was an affront the Pantheon, and
 the Law, anything that defied the Law or its upholders in spirit or in
 letter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These were the ever watchful eye of the Castigator, the arm that made the
 Law reach into every heart, body, and mind, the Procastinators.
 Their training was simple, crude, and effective, hammering into them the
 utmost loyalty unto the Law, as well as teaching them how to use people
 in order to learn all that there is, all that is going on, the rumours,
 the happenings, the weddings and deaths, births and oath-takings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything that went on not just in Pyr, but everywhere in the Territories,
 they had to know.
 And if the need arose, they disciplined, re-enlightened, or fetch to the
 Ministers those they deemed suspicious or genuinely guilty of sin.
 And then they enforced the Law and the divine will of the Ministry, unflinching
, following the credo that All is Law.
 And if they performed impeccably, surely they would have the honour of
 becoming Procastinator Militant, part of the Ruling Council, the left hand
 of the Castigator himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a structure that had been handed down from the Gods themselves, so
 its purpose and form were Holy, and any talk of reform, change, or deviation
 from the established was treated at best as blasphemy, but usually as expressin
g heresy, and was treated accordingly by public torture and death.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None were exempt from such punishment, especially the men in the Ruling
 Council, who were the paragon of Law itself to all the people.
 Such a hideous concept was not unknown, that a man in the Ruling Council
 would denounce the Gods by commiting or speaking heresy, for it happened
 long before, in a past almost rightly forgotten and excised from the Annals
 of the Territories, but still lingering in peoples' memory as Shan's Betrayal,
 a myth to freighten the children into obeying, a fable to instruct and
 put the fear of the Gods into the soul of men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shan had been a General of the Army, at a time when the Territories had
 not grown past the lands around Pyr.
 When the Ruling Council decided it was time to enlighten the nearby shores
 of Urfall, Shan was reluctant, at first.
 The story says he was publicly chastised, with a hundred lashes to his
 body edging him close to death.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because he was deemed an exceptional strategist and a peerless tactician,
 he was once more asked to lead the armies that would enlighten Urfall,
 instead of being stripped of office and rank and live on the streets as
 a beggar, given the opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of the Pantheon,
 the people and the Castigator.
 He acceded, and the armies marched off, gleaming in their metal armor,
 the blessings of the Castigator sung over the Southern Gates of Pyr.
 Within a few weeks, Shan's armies seemed lost, no message of the war reaching
 Pyr, and no messengers from Pyr ever returning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, Shan appeared over the hills encircling Pyr, and had with him not
 only the armies he had marched off with weeks before, but horses, and men
 and catapults and hellish contraptions that spurted fire and death, from
 Urfall.
 He had spread the heresy to the armies like the mythic whores of old spread
 disease, like the cancer that spreads from the roots of a tree to its leaves
 and brings about its death.
 And he had the Urfalli with him, their machines working in unfathomable
 ways, the products of heretical pacts with the forces of evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He reached the Gates of Pyr and demanded the surrender first and foremost
 of the Ruling Council, and had the ineffable audacity to accuse the Council
 of lies and crimes to the people, twisting the word of the Law and speweing
 horrific untruths.
 It was an attempt to poison the minds of everyone in the city as well,
 promising that none of those who surrendered willingly would be hurt in
 any way, and a fair trial would be arranged for all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for the Council, who would be executed after their supposed lies
 had been exposed and their non-existent crimes against men proved unquestionabl
y.
 Such heretic lies had never been uttered or thought of before, and never
 would again, their venomous treachery so base, the Castigator himself is
 said to have cried in desperation, for he had never thought a dearly loved
 brother like Shan would fall from grace like that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The city was utterly defenseless, save but a few procastinators and old
 army tutors, and lowly farmers, herders, artisans and traders that had
 not yielded shield, spear or sword not once in their lives.
 The armies of Shan had cast away all form of decency, form or honor, and
 turning into a heretic rabble, had begun to scour the lands, pillaging,
 raping, and burning, before what they thought would be the grand feast
 of Pyr itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they never managed to sink their putrid claws and teeth into the immaculate
 flesh of the City of Pyr, for it was protected by the Gods, as are all
 their faithful and humble servants.
 For when the time was nigh, and all seemed lost, the Castigator Hanul Ofodor
 the 1st, retired from the halls of the Disciplinarium, and went deep into
 the Sacred Vaults, where he and the Patriarch offered their blood to commune
 with the Gods, and ask for deliverance in that time of need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a day and a night, while the heretic hordes of Shan looted and pillaged,
 and while the outer walls of Pyr were about to fall, an angel sent from
 the Gods appeared in their image, casting brilliant rays of cleansing light,
 and annihilating the armies of Shan who had no other recourse but to flee
 like the vermin they were.
 None escaped the angel's wrath, who spread the cleansing fire to every
 last part of Shan's army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Day of Redemption had passed, the City of Urfall and its majestic
 harbor and proud workshops were all extinguished in a ball of light so
 pure in its wrath that those who saw it with bare eyes went blind, and
 would forever be praised in their lives as Martyrs of the Wrath of the
 Gods, spreading the tale of Shan and what they saw to everywhere they went.
 And such was the way the story was told, from one generation to the next,
 as a reminder, even though the official Annals never admitted or recorded
 it, for as much as it mattered, it should never have happened in the eyes
 of the Gods, and so it never had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And such was the tale of Shan Lagus, the Betrayer, proscribed from history,
 but alive in the memory of Law-fearing people, people like the Archminister
 LaVasse, a wide, big-boned man, dressed in an opulent surplice, holy texts
 in High Helican weaved around the sleeves, a Seal of Office hanging round
 his neck in a pendant made of platinum and emeralds, fittingly pure and
 clean to represent the qualities of the Archminister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was presently at the Strategium Proper, in the company of the General
 of the Army, and the Procastinator Militant, whose embarassing near-blunder
 at last night's festivities at the announcement of the Last Holy Campaign
 as it was officially now named, had not gone unnoticed, and had become
 the subject of sarcastic comments and irony even at lower echelons of Ministry
 and Army, but had only naturally been ignored by the Procastinators as
 a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General of the Army had not been present at the event due to having
 received news of the Castigator's decision from beforehand, and had indeed
 spent the night hard at work putting his most trusted and capable people
 together, rousing them up from their sleep in order to lay down the priorities
 of planning and start orchestrating the massive preparations involved in
 such an endeavour as a Holy Campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had of course learned of the Procastinator's Militant blunder, and even
 though second hand accounts rarely manage to do justice, he had exchanged
 knowing looks and smiles with the Archminister that had gone largely unnoticed
 by the Procastinator Militant, a somewhat alarming fact if one would care
 to extrapolate the level of the Procastinators' vigilance from the qualities
 apparent in its most senior member.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three of them had been there from before dawn, the Archminister and
 Procastinator Militant arriving together though having rode in separate
 coaches, having left from the Disciplinarium once proper etiquette was
 adhered to and the reenactment of the Pacification of Zaelin thoroughly
 reenacted, with bloodletting and prayer ensuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were now sipping fresh hot uwe tea, comfortably seated at the General's
 planning chamber, all sorts of charts and maps laid out over a grand table,
 heaps reports and still unsgined orders heaped upon the General's desk,
 a utilitarian piece of furniture, like most around the chamber, sturdy
 and well-made but otherwise unadorned and plain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Archminister was seated on the only luxurious chair available, plush
 velvet adorning the back and the sitting surface, elegantly inlaid pieces
 of ivory, black granite and tetherwood intertwined in flowing designs in
 the stylish armrests.
 The Procastinator Militant sat at a simple stool, much more accomodating
 for a soldier in search of a few moments of resting one's legs during brief
 pauses in a battle, rather than a man of such a high office as a Procastinator
 Militant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General had briefly apologized to the Procastinator Militant for lack
 of a better seating apparatus, and explained that any and all equipment
 deemed to be of an extraneous nature was being dismantled to be put into
 other uses now that the preparations for the campaign demanded every last
 bit of usable material.
 And that even included artisan chairs made of young sycamore and inlaid
 with ivory, granite, and tetherwood, not unlike the last one available
 for seating persons of importance, of which the Archminister seemed to
 make such good use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not that he implied at any point, the General continued, that the Procastinator
 Militant was not a person of incalculable importance, but alas, the Archministe
r had seniority according to the Law of Founding, so it was Law that essentially
 demanded that the Archminister be seated in the proper way, while he would
 have to make do with what little was available at such a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that, the Procastinator Militant withdrew from any thought or intention
 of protesting, and simply accepted the proferred stool graciously.
 By looking at the Archminister, if one didn't know better he might misinterpret
 his slight grin as an indication of silent enjoyment of the unfortunate
 predestinations of the Procastinator on his behalf, but such a man was
 beyond such base thoughts, and was merely grinning at the studious labor
 going on around the Strategium Proper, praising the high spirits of everyone
 involved, and personally congratulating the General of the Army for kicking
 off the preparations in the way expected:

I am more than honoured, indeed blessed, to hear such praise from your Excellenc

 Yes, they are most valuable, as well as tetherwood and the sycamore.
 From what I know of the artisan's techniques, the ivory is used in delicate
 steamer parts without which the damnable things would blow up before going
 ten feet.
 The sycamore and tetherwood are used in constructing siege engines, and
 the granite is turned into pellets for the steamers' slingshots.

Oh, make no mistake Tyrpledge, my rank, office, and related trappings of
 my status as Archminister still hold and I expect you to diligently administer
 the proper respect.
 At least in public, when we are not planning together, exchanging information
 and agreeing to our next best course of action.
 Be reminded of course, that the Castigator is always briefed on our meetings
 and though we have been given executive control of the Holy Campaign, whatever
 course of action we decide on, has to be ratified by His Piousness.
 In grave matters of battle that is, since currently I have been empowered
 with freedom to act as the Castigator's proxy in these preliminary stages
 of the preparation.

\begin_layout Standard
La Vasse's voice assumed a harsher tone, the weight in his voice and words
 punctuating his heightened status of authority.
 His strict but fair tone was indicative of his intentions: He would be
 reasonably cooperative and would dispense of the pleasantries and honours
 where applicable, but that would not bring Tyrpledge up to the same level
 as him, the proxy of the Castigator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He also seemed to limit this dispensation to Tyrpledge alone, since Gomermont
 apart from being a relatively useless dolt, the most common type of Procastinat
or, his office also was not immediately pertinent to the Campaign, since
 he and his men would remain in the cities and towns, ever watchful of signs
 of insurrection and heresy when the Castigator and much of the governing
 mechanism would be in the Widelands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge was simply a soldier, a sword to be wielded like a tool, bending
 to the master's will.
 He had never had any misconceptions of his status, and the Archminister's
 words carried no different message: he would still be following orders
 diligently and respectfully, he just didn't have to stand at attention
 the whole time.

La Vasse, I need to know.
 You are closer to the Castigator, his proxy, probably the only reliable

 Sane people, at least.
 No cities, or towns, or anything to capture, and maintain.
 With no population to enlighten, no forces arrayed against us, what objectives

This was where the marble road leading into the Widelands begun.
 This was where his quest had taken him so far.
 For weeks he had been on the road, suffering fools too gladly sometimes,
 subjecting his body into such a trial of strength of will and body as travellin
g on foot for almost what seemed to be half around the world.
 Indeed a feat in itself, it was simply the means to far greater a prize,
 the complete knowledge of which still eluded him, despite all the years
 of studies and inquiries, both his and his masters'.

The marble road started off as a narrow, thin road, small edges of pure
 white marble-like material delineating its boundaries.
 It was not really made from marble, for if it was it would have been demolished
 and chipped away bit by bit long ago.
 But it seems to defy any tool and machination of man, neither pickaxe nor
 chisel capable of even slightly damaging the road.

A sleek, shiny white-grey road, cold to the touch but fine and delicate,
 like glasswork.
 But unbreakable, unyielding, unscathed by time, man, or nature.
 A foreign body so exquisitely crafted that it is indeed unique, and no

 to construct such a piece of perfection, truly as some poet once said

It was, and had always been, part of the lands, but alien to them as well.
 The people had always known of the marble road, just as they knew of the
 trees, the mountains and the rivers, the forests and the glenns, the fields
 and the wheat, the goat and the cow, the suns and the moon.
 But these things were of nature, and the marble road clearly was not, for
 nature abhors uniqueness.
 Animals come in pairs, rivers abound, so do trees.
 But there is only one marble road.
 A perfect thing; a left over from the time Gods walked among us.
 Or even so, before us.

What reason was there behind it? Why does it lead into the Widelands? What
 is it made of? And who made it? With what tools, what materials did they
 use? They, because this must surely be the work of thousands.
 No single man could ever accomplish such a work in his lifetime.
 Perhaps, most rightly so, it is the work of the Gods.
 And to try and unravel their reasoning and purpose can only lead to madness,
 heresy, or both.

Molo decided to leave such thoughts aside, thoughts which beget questions
 that begged for answers he could not find.
 At least not before he ventured into the Widelands proper, until he found
 what Umberth described as the Necropolis, where inestimable knowledge was
 waiting to be uncovered to the world.
 Knowledge of a time unknown, perhaps before man ever walked the lands.
 The Time of the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was already a fascinating sensation, walking upon the very same road
 that even the Gods might have walked upon once.
 What other man, apart from him and Umberth had dared walk the marble road
 unto its terribly unknown end? What other man, who lived long enough to
 tell the tale? What other man, who was not hunted down as a heretic, a
 blasphemer? What other man who didn't have a tragic, miserable end?

He grinned wickedly at these thoughts, for they were immediately followed
 by his aspirationg: He wouldn't perish neither in the Widelands, nor at
 the hands of a fanatical mob, or the ever watchful Procastinators.
 He would not succumb to any torture the Ministers might want to put him
 through for when all his trials and tribulation had come to pass this,
 he would not be simply a man anymore.
 He would not be hunted down, or exiled, or even held at bay, as a feared
 and terrible man.

\begin_layout Standard
No, when all the power and majesty and magnificence of the Gods was unveiled
 and made manifest through him, he would be transformed into a being of
 awe and power that the lands had not witnessed since the beginning of time.

 loved, and cherished, and worshipped as a God among men should.

He knew the truth of it, he could feel it in his heart and bones, see it
 in his twisting dreams.
 Dreams of cleansing light and fire, himself a creature of wrath and glory,
 terrible power at his hands and unimaginable purpose in his mind.
 The purpose of the Gods.
 Indeed it was their divine plan.
 Conceived and hatched untold aeons ago, and he was their chosen instrument.
 He would not fail them.
 For the lust of that power burned deep withing, deeper than the need for
 breath itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he had indeed to find the Necropolis first, and that task seemed ever
 so slightly more difficult with each passing day.
 Last night he had found the marble road, and eagerly walked under the stars
 for a long stretch of time, without pause.
 He had seen the trees give way to bush, the grass wither, the sounds of
 animals grow weaker, fainter, fewer.
 He knew he was entering the Widelands, the signs visible around him.
 It had been the same with Umberth, as he had recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he laid down to sleep near the marble road, under a skinny old withered
 bark of a tree, a cluster of rocks sheltering him from the winds, he put
 his cloak under his head as a pillow, and drew his blanket high enough
 to cover his face from the rising suns, and slept lightly, with a smile
 on his face, as if he was merely a content child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he woke up in the afternoon, the suns still high, he was more than
 surprised to see that the road was not there.
 In fact, the road was nowhere in sight, as if he had dreamt of how he got

 away into chaos, and madness.

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was sure he had been traveling in the correct direction.
 More than sure, he felt certain it was the right direction from the beginning.
 He had studied the maps his master had crafted painstakingly, with reverent
 attention to detail many times over, and he was certain he had correctly
 identified some, if not all of the landmarks mentioned in Umberth's tale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he was sure that when he stepped on the glistening white road, hard and
 unyielding, though soft to the touch, almost like metal but more like porcelain
 or clay, he was indeed walking on the marble road.
 And that when he got off the marble road in search of a place to sleep
 awhile and rest before following it once more, it would still be there,
 an undisturbed reality, a known quantity, a fact.
 By the Gods, it was a

 like the marble road disappear in a matter of hours?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps he was indeed losing his mind.
 Perhaps Umberth was a crazed old fool, and his esquire doubly so.
 And it had all been a fantasy to stir the minds most weak, those who were
 most prone to fall for grand visions, tales of mystery and untold secrets.
 And he had followed that fantasy in vain, like a fool the sort of which
 he despised and felt little less than pity for.
 He was a fool, half-mad and soon quite lost, left to fend for his life
 in this hostile land, with nothing of worth or substance to live off it.
 Such an unfitting end to a journey that should have changed the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Black despair seemed to take over him, his head swimming in a sea of moroseness,
 thoughts of ruin and death his mind's sole occupation.
 He was tense with bad temper.
 His fists were clenched, banging against a rock once every so often, as
 if it alone was to blame for his meandering path up to this foolishness.
 His despair turned into rage, overwrought since he was with anger at his
 failure.
 He retraced his thoughts and conversed silently with himself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would he accept an ignominious defeat at the hands of fate? Would he blindly
 give in to the temptation of despair? Throaw away the years of studies
 and preparation? His long walk, his peregrination to the Land of the God
 unfinished, nothing but an exercise in futility? And to what purpose would
 he devote himself now? What other singular task can match his ambition,
 his dreams beyond the realm of mortal men?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what if he was indeed a madman? What of it? Madmen answer to noone,
 only to the Gods.
 And so would he answer.
 The Land of the Gods beckoned.
 They tested his mettle.
 Only the one who is mad enough to challenge such authority can truly knock
 on the Holy Gates.
 He was all alone out here, in the Widelands.
 The marble road disappearing, was just the start.
 The beginning of the play the Gods seemed to love so much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would play.
 He would play in anything they chose to throw at him.
 He would find the Necropolis, at any cost.
 This, was merely an inconvenience, one of many he should still encounter.
 For once he set out, he knew he would be attempting a feat that almost
 noone had succeeded at before.
 And even if he did, as Umberth might have had, nothing was certain of the
 power therein, and how it would finally become his own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would have to see for his own, marble road or not.
 He got up decisively, and walked back to where he remembered the road lay
 exactly.
 He was standing either right on a spot where there was a road to be seen
 last night, or only a few feet away, he was certain.
 The grass had a wholesome quality, as if it had always covered the same
 ground as it did now, as if there never was a marble road here, not ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it was an illusion.
 A mirage.
 The only logical explanation he could arrive to with what little he knew
 of the marble road, and ignoring the possibility of him being mentally
 unstable, which was not helpful if at all true, this was the only reasonable
 explanation.
 The marble road was a lie, and by some sort of means unknown to man certainly,
 it was there to be seen, only to lure those that were mentally unprepared
 and easily misled and fooled deeper into the Widelands.
 A fly trap of sorts, he gathered.
 Well, that would be of little significance now that he had uncovered that
 the marble road was in fact not there at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thought took him to a passage from Umberth's tale, which made more sense
 now that he had seen this happen with his very own eyes.
 The passage read:

Only a few nights after we had gone definetely in Wideland country, we lost
 track of the road.
 Deciding to camp quite a distance away from the road, towards what had
 seemed to be a natural spring in a rock formation, we had lost sight of
 the marble road.
 We were doubly misled, since the spring had dried and was no more.
 The maps had failed us early on.
 Terlet went mad and master Umberth ordered me to put him out of his misery.
 Nubir and Vamden probably got lost trying to find the road, or simply decided
 to vanish before we went deeper into the Widelands.
 In any case, we never saw or heard of them again.

Molo had thought that they had indeed lost teir bearings in the difficult
 to navigate terrain of the Widelands.
 That was why he didn't stray out of sight of the road.
 But it seemed that had little effect.
 The road had vanished seemingly of its own volition, or by forces and plans
 he could not understand and certainly not control.
 At least for now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He decided to continue on the same direction he had taken as before, when
 the road was still visible.
 The exact location of the Necropolis was a mystery, but he had arrived
 at the conclusion that it lay far enough deep into the Widelands, into
 the Dunes of the Widelands, the desert proper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he would grind along purposefully with the same eastward direction, deeper
 and deeper into the Widelands.
 He would try and record the distances traveled, counting his steps, in
 order to both focus his mind, as well as keep an account of how far deep
 each day of travel takes him.
 There will be time to recollect, muse, and decide on every next step when
 he stops to rest and take sustenance and water, two things that will indeed
 be scarce.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more the Widelands turned into a desert, the more imperative it came
 for him to conserve his water.
 That is why he had chosenn to travel at night, both to use its cover if
 anyone had been following him, and certainly because it was cooler at night,
 the walk not as demanding in both food or water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he still should be able to find some water until he went deep in the
 Dunes.
 There, he doubted any water could be found at all for days on end.
 And that was where he would either perish or triumph.
 Deep in the desert dunes of the Widelands, searching for the Necropolis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was his preferred way, what he thought was the most sensible one, he
 waited for dusk to come and the suns to come down the sky, before he would
 start walking again.
 He picked up his knapsack with what little more he carried within, picked
 up his walking stick and started off once more, feeling he had one a small
 battle today, renewed vigor and determination coursing through him.
 He needed no road to find his path, he would instead tread on relentlessly,
 and his path and journey would be sung in the aeons to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept a count of his steps in his head, and focused his eyes on a specific
 star to follow, trying not to lose track of either his footsteps or his
 direction.
 And as he trod on, the star firmly fixed in his gaze, he thought he saw
 a great silver-white line appear in front of him, like someone had let
 open open a small slit of glittering light amidst the rocky desert night.
 He blinked, thinking he had not rested long enough, that the whole incident
 with the road was taxing his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he had this rush of exhilaration and hope, and started running
 towards the thin sliver of white in the dark.
 He ran as if his life depended on it, forgetting everything about counting
 steps or going in a straight line.
 He just ran ahead towards the straight white line that seemed to fill the
 horizon and was coming ever so closer to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the line had grown past a line into something recognisable indeed
 familiar, his aching feet and burning lungs meant nothing at all, for he
 was once again stepping on the marble road.
 He threw his head back and let his body drop on the road, laughing like
 a child who had found a toy he had thought lost.

He sniffed the air around the ragged, bloodied clothing, and a grimace of

 Naturally, such phenomena had subsided considerably after it became a well-know

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch's last words struck true with the Inquisitor who managed to
 simply nod and rushed up the stairs as if swaths of fire were behind him.
 A dull metal thud echoed, the large door to this chamber closing right
 behind the Inquisitor, who walked closer to Philo, still alive and awake,
 unable to look at him face to face.
 A grin that threatened to tear the Patriarch's face apart suddenly appeared
 on his face, his teeth revealed to be an immaculate pearly white.

\begin_layout Standard
His next steps took him closer to Philo, the Patriarch's boots barely making
 an audible impression on the stone floor.
 He noticed the pool of clotted blood lying under Philo, his back a horrible
 mess of deep gouges and bloody wounds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rivulets of blood stained his whole body, from his shoulders down to his
 legs.
 His feet were bare and bruised livid, the skin so deeply stained crimson
 that it was almost impossible to know whether there was any of it left.
 Philo's thickset body had lost its healthy color, and seemed only a little
 less than feeble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo did not answer verbally, neither did he nod.
 He simply spat vehemently, a thick mix of blood and saliva landing on the
 pool of his own blood, the little splash audible enough to register as
 an action defiance, or even possibly indifference.

These amateurs who worked on you, were thorough, I'll give them that.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch had leaned closer to Philo, he was standing on his right side,
 looking at him with bright enthusiasm, expectancy loitering timidly in
 his voice.
 The Patriarch wished dearly for an easy answer, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that would make things smooth and civil.
 A recognition of being outplayed, an acceptance of defeat, the knowledge
 of pointlessness proven in Philo's resignation from the fight before it
 could even really begin.
 Such a joy, the feeling of superiority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Patriarch also knew Philo would not choose the easy way out.
 He was too proud, too ignorant and too stupid to do so, to spare himself
 further unreached before heights of pain, unbearable humiliation, and in
 the end, total destruction of his mind, body, and soul.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He must have thought himself already a martyr for his cause, a proud shining
 beacon against the darkness.
 Someone for the others to follow as an example, an stoic fighter, a proud
 man that could not be brought low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How embarassingly naive.
 He would leave his tongue and throat intact for as long as possible.
 Their own screams always became insufferable.
 He would drive him mad, when he was through with him.
 A mad, witless fool.
 Not a martyr, but a wretched sack of flesh.
 Nothing.
 He would obliterate him utterly in the most literal sense.
 Philo Dutur would be in all manners erased, as he had never even existed
 or indeed been born.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah, the small mercies, the little joys of his life and work.
 That was what kept him interested, what made him tick.
 In the end, it would all have been worth it, just for these bright moments
 of uninhibited truth and feeling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the cries blanketed all the senses, thoughts and feelings.
 When the reality of pain promoted a higher sense of self, when the men
 and women that received his attention were indeed enlightened, their forms
 pure and bright right before they ended, like the last light of dying suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was, the Patriarch thought, an art form.
 He wished he could make Philo understand before he began, but that would
 be an effort in futility.
 Words would not affect him, his ears and mind were closed shut to him,
 that much was certain.
 It was of little consequence, because soon he would be so much more receptive,
 like a child only now beginning to learn, he would learn so much about
 him in so little time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch was filled with a fleeting sensation of jealousy, he though
 to himself how blessed indeed these people were, to be stripped down to
 their essential self, see for just once clearly what everything meant,
 the truth of life bared naked before their crying souls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost wished he could experience that first hand, but he had the knowledge
 ingrained.
 The pain and sensation were not worth as much as the revelation did.
 He felt almost violated, robbed of his right to discover, experience, learn
 anew.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was as if he was a mere tool, that should never amount to much.
 A useful but otherwise uninteresting tool.
 These people here, these were considered so much more intriguing, entertaining,
 mysteries worth uncovering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An inner rage that had been left neglected for too long, flared up again.
 He could use that rage, he would make Philo really believe.
 Not just acquiesce, or give up his friends, his family or all that he loved
 and held dear.
 He would make him a true believer, a man happy to die in servitude at long
 last.
 The Patriarch told him, with a laugh and a grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to accentuate his point, Philo did spit once more, reddish saliva coming
 out of his mouth, the broken teeth and wounds in his mouth still bleeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch replied in a candid way, as if exchanging opinions with a
 peer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And with that, the Patriarch reached for Philo's chains, a mere touch of
 his unlocking the first one, Philo's body swaying immediately to his other
 chained side.
 It was all very sudden, and Philo barely had time to put his feet down
 to be able to stand instead of slumping on the stone floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Patriarch unchained his remaining hand, Philo tried to act as fast
 as possible.
 His right, drooping side was nearer the Patriarch, so he mustered all the
 strength that he could and focused it on his elbow, suddenly jutting it
 towards the Patriarch's groin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did that, he was already clenching his left fist, trying to gather
 some momentum by twisting his torso and perhaps landing a good punch on
 the Patriarch.
 This was probably his last and only opportunity, so he thought he'd make
 it count and go for the kill as well, his thought focusing on the motley
 arsenal of torturing tools available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His elbow did not connect with the Patriarch.
 Instead he felt a rush of air, as if a void was suddenly created were the
 Patriarch was standing.
 As his torso swooped around in its instinctive movement, his feet swiveled
 to accomodate the sudden move, and his left fist came rushing down only
 to meet thin air.
 His body was awkwardly positioned now, and precariously balanced, like
 the mock statue of a victor or an athlete, about to fall off his feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch was not where he should have been, and was instead at Philo's
 left side now, like he had instantly sidestepped him with inhuman speed,
 reflexes and foresight.
 As Philo turned his bruised head around, one eye completely hidden behind
 swollen tissue, the other one almost damaged and bled beyond recognition,
 but still seemingly functional, he managed to ask the Patriarch, evidently
 surprised and dumbstruck:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet another snigger before he laid out his right hand, his adorned hand,
 the Hand of Tribulation, and grasped Philo from his forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo went limp almost instantly, his big bulk sagging down onto the floor,
 legs sprawled awkwardly, arms simply resting against his body, barely touching
 the bloodied floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His face, or what was still left of it, tried to take on an expression of
 pain, flinch and contort.
 Instead, it slackened, his mouth opened up to reveal broken death, open
 sores and wounds.
 He started mewling incoherently, blood and saliva dribbling down his chin,
 incomprehensible words sputtered in blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch smiled, his face lit up and seemed pleased that his work was
 beginning to take form now.
 He asked Philo in a sweet, inviting voice:
\end_layout

Who else was with you in those caves Philo? Was it someone I know? Who were

Philo seemed to twist his body a little, as if trying to escape an invisible
 grasp, and his head shook with involuntary tremors.
 The Patriarch tightened his hold, and his voice became a venomous hiss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo let out a deep moan, and his eyes tried to let tears flow, but it
 was nearly impossible.
 His eyes were almost swollen shut, tears welling up constantly, making
 his vision, if he had any left, a complete blur.
 His moaning became deeper, his body shaken by involuntary spasms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch screamed in hellish fury, the air around them cracking audibly,
 small arcs of blue lightning flickering between the Patriarch's ringed
 fingers:

\begin_layout Standard
Philo's skull was throbbing, enormous veins jutting out ready to burst and
 his flesh was beginning to turn red hot.
 His throat managed to let out a few audible words, while his head was still
 being tightly head, forming an odd angle with the rest of his body, as
 if about to snap off its place:

 face expressing mild disappointment, resentment accentuating his words:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He let go of Philo, who instantly regained some sort of composure, though
 he was drained of his vitality to the point of death, his body barely alive,
 his every breath copious and painful.
 Breathing deeply, his voice now little more than a whisper, he said amidst
 weeps and moans of pain:

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch grasped Philo's head once more.
 The screams filled the chamber, echoing through the stone surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guards above the torture chamber were used to the cries of the sinners.
 But not to whatever it was that they were hearing.
 They became uneasy.
 At length, one of them vomited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the other guards came to relieve them, the screams and voices could
 still be heard.
 And that went on, and on.
 All through the night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Patriarch emerged from the door of the torture chamber, the guards
 posted were almost ashen in color, but still managed to stand to attention
 briskly enough.
 The Patriarch said to the first one he laid eyes on:

Both saluted and bowed deeply before silently rushing to perform their assigned

 The Patriarch walked down the long corridor that would bring him to the
 staircase leading to his chambers.
 He felt stiff from the effort, but satisfied.

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled to himself, before musing aloud:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich had finally slept, his protestations about the lack of a moon
 and night sky silently put aside when the fatigue took over and the anxiety
 and nervousness subsided after their thirst had been quenched and a warm,
 tasty meal sat comfortably in their bellies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was snoring heavily now, and though it would have normally been less
 than a pleasant sound, under the circumstances it was mildly comforting,
 as it let Amonas know that not everything was amiss, that some things were
 still normal, albeit frustrating and hard to deal with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a thing was Hilderich snore.
 Amonas tried to picture a future lady D'Augnacy trying to go to sleep next
 to the man, but failed to end his train of thought in anything other than
 a grin or a hearty snigger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded to himself as he thought that it was a good thing that Hilderich
 had slept after all that had happened to him, he definetely needed sleep
 more than himself.
 Not that he didn't wish for sleep to come, and bless him with a few precious
 hours of oblivion and rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a nagging feeling he knew, that rest would not come even in his sleep.
 Nightmares would haunt him, as long as he was away from Celia, as long
 as he couldn't know what would befall her should he fail to return, if
 he was stranded in this lush version of hell with Hilderich as his sole
 companion for the rest of their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least, before they turned on each other, went mad or took their own lives
 as their last meaningful action, sparing them a life of torture and sleepless,
 unending days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was sitting cross-legged, outside the cover of the small makeshift
 shelter he had fashioned, where most of it was taken over by the sprawled
 figure of Hilderich, who seemed to be thankfully quite at ease sleeping
 on the ground, with nothing but his already muddied and stained cloak as
 a matress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He, on the other hand, could not let himself surrender to sleep.
 It was not the lack of moon, or the invariably harsh conditions of continuous
 light, unbearable heat and sticky moisture, that prevented him from having
 some kind of much needed rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was as was the case most of the time, his mind that could not be appeased,
 that could not be turned off as it should.
 The immediate necessities had taken their toll already.
 The search for water which he still didn't know if it was indeed drinkable,
 the food he hoped would not prove much of a problem now that they knew
 there was at least something edible to be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was not just the simple minded anxiety of surviving.
 It was this strange new environment, totally unlike anything he had experienced
 before.
 Certainly nothing he knew ever existed, even on the most faraway lands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the suns were wrong too.
 This might not even be their own world.
 The thought had unconsciously been formed before, when they first saw that
 clear, harsh sky.
 But now it took form, voice, he could here the thought ringing loudly in
 his head.
 This might be another world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultimate truth revealed in form and substance all over him.
 And he had noone to share it but Hilderich, who might even hold it yet
 as suspicious, implausible at best.
 Another world.
 But no animals to speak of, no people, however queer or similar, however
 friendly or hostile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He suddenly felt terribly alone, as if indeed the thought of them being
 the sole two individuals on this other world was weighing him down, grinding
 him to the ground.
 Just the two of them, wandering like castaways on a strange and mysterious
 island where no ship would ever sail to.
 An uncharted land, its existence always hidden away, never to be revealed,
 their bones bleached and turned into lime for the wild growths to set roots
 in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His gaze turned to the tiny flickers of the fire, a few coals still red
 hot, thin lines of smoke rising from the perpetually wet wood.
 He focused on the fire, marvelling at its simple avarice, consuming the
 wood steadily, unperturbed, without a care for the world at large.
 A force of nature.
 A universal truth, fire.
 It eats away as much as it can and then it perishes on its own accord,
 accepting its fate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How he longed for such simplicity in life.
 Away from all this, this world, the other world he knew as home.
 Away from the Castigator's tyranny and its false Gods.
 Away from poverty and the coming war and the misery that would ensue no
 matter who the victor was.
 How much he had wanted to get away from all that, with Celia by his side.
 And they could let the world burn for all he cared.
 Just like fire burns on wood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sniggered despite himself, thinking he was letting himself down somehow.
 Perhaps he had been too morose in his thoughts, their plight so far sinking
 his feeling even more than he had realised.
 It would do him no good, that he knew.
 No matter whether any of these thoughts hold to the truth in the end, they
 would do him no real good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew that thinking too much and acting too little had brought everything
 to this point.
 A rule of tyranny, based on lies and deceit.
 People dying everyday of famine, or rotting away in eternally dark dungeons
 for stealing a loaf of bread, or having children without permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He shook his head.
 Permission was needed to create life.
 As if any God would need to consider the utility of the inevitable, the
 unimpeachable, the unstoppable force of life that permeated everything,
 from the worms in the ground to the stars themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed a sad moment when a star fell; but someone had said that another
 one was born at the same time.
 He had no way of knowing that for sure, since who could count the innumerable
 stars or the grains of sand in a beach? But he knew it in his heart it
 would be true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Life just keeps happening.
 Whether anyone permits it or not, it just doesn't care and blindly goes
 on whatever the cost.
 Even in this place.
 There might have encountered no animals so far, but the vegetation..
 Astounding, lush, green.
 If it wasn't so damn hot and humid he could have felt like living here
 for ever.
 Him, Celia, and their children.
 The many more to come after his firstborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would he ever live to see all that come true?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sighed as he mentally chastised himself for thinking in such an almost
 saturnine way.
 He stood up, deciding to clear his mind, flush it clean of any thought.
 Any kind of action would do his spirits good.
 And since he couldn't rest or sleep, a mild activity that would not drain
 him of much energy, would be a welcome change in pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would go for a walk, in a way exploring their immediate surroundings,
 perhaps even scouting ahead their path to the bull-horned structure, that
 huge fork of a structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich stirred in his sleep, and mumbled something inaudible, licking
 his lips and smiling lightly.
 He must be dreaming, Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that Hilderich could sleep as if nothing of import had transpired
 over the past few days, brought a smile of hope to Amonas' lips.
 Perhaps not everyone looked on things so dourly, and had good reason not
 to.
 So did he, he thought to himself, bringing an image of lovely Celia to
 his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lovely Celia, her hair touching her slender body with grace enough to make
 any man weep from the joyful sight, and instantly adore her beyond reason.
 Her face a sweet and mellow taste, if his eyes could swallow her whole,
 and forever feel her smile.
 Celia beloved, and to the death his mate and pair.
 His firstborn's mother to be, his miraculous haven where every storm subsided
 and all the seas came to rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was not far from giving birth to their child, and though they had known
 bloodied times of fire, steel and death were drawing close, he had at least
 the surety of her touch and her smile to count on and see life or death
 by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now he was denied of her touch, the smell of her breath, the feeling of
 her body clasped against his own, her gaze locked with his own, oceans
 of time passing by in mere moments.
 Damn them! For that hurt alone, he would make them pay.
 Whoever was indeed behind all the lies and curtains of deceit.
 Behind the Castigator.
 He could feel there must be something to the Gods.
 Every lie, he had observed, has been sown from some truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he walked about the place, he noticed more and more beauty and celebrating
 life in this otherwise simmering cauldron of green.
 Small colourful flowers with overgrown petals and fat, juicy stems.
 Lithe trees that could be easily bent without being broken, and thick overgrown
 plants that dared climb the huge trees, hugging them, curled around them
 like charmed snakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed teeming with life.
 It remained a mystery to Amonas why they had come across no animals at
 all, barely enough insects to simply make their unwanted stay even more
 miserable.
 He mused for a while at the strange color of the only sun, and decided
 he could not come up with anything resembling an explanation other than
 this was another world to their own, indeed wholly alien and undecipherable,
 at least with the knowledge at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps they could learn more of it before they returned, but that would
 be more in Hilderich's domain, not his own.
 He was more interested in solving problems, not analysing them thoroughly
 and documenting them for posteriority and further study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be a strange day indeed when he would be able to sit in a chair
 and tell his grandchildren stories of the other world.
 Or maybe even worlds.
 If there are indeed more than one, why just two?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The walk had made him thirsty, and he felt like maybe it was time for him
 to return, and with his mind put a little bit at ease, perhaps try for
 some restful sleep.
 Even though he was used to hardship, sleep was essential, and noone could
 go more than a day or so without some sleep, however little.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had also climbed up an inviting tree, in an effort to see over the canopy
 if at all possible, get their bearings, so they could start off in the
 right direction for the nearest bull-horn.
 Getting the direction wrong while already being lost would be a blow to
 their morale, let alone a waste of precious time and meagre resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back in their own world, the Kinsfolk were about to strike for the first
 and hopefully the last time.
 Years of planning had led to this culminating point, and an untold number
 of his brethren had lost their lives in the effort of keeping it a secret
 alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew they were being followed, he knew they were being watched.
 But he also knew they were waiting for the right time to act, catch them
 all in one fell blow, root them out forever, crush them utterly and dispense
 with the notion of a rebellion for untold generations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would be there when the time came, that much was the least expected of
 him.
 And he'd rather die trying rather than abandon and shame his brothers in
 blood and soul.
 Or face the wrathful scorn of Celia; no, he could never suffer that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weak but warm smile crept on his face as he imagined such a scene, Celia
 all fiery wrath, her gaze searing, boring through him as if he were made
 of powdery snow, and he laughed despit himself, memories of her rushing
 through him like a stream of water on parched land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he approached their tiny camp he could hear Hilderich screaming his name
 over the top of his lungs, probably terrified at the thought that he had
 gone and left him there to die all alone, a final twist of a incongruously
 ill fate.
 He answered back, his strong gruff voice undimmed by the blanket of vegetation
 all around them:

A few more steps brought Amonas nearer to their camp where he could see
 Hilderich quite evidently dishevelled, his hair in wild disarray from the
 sleep and the humid hell they had to endure, his clothing almost unrecognisable
 by now, a uniformly grey and brown mud covering most of it.
 Amonas waved a dismissing hand from afar, laughed heartily and replied
 playfully:

\begin_layout Standard
He good humor went largely unnoticed by Hilderich, whose spirits where in
 sharp contrast.
 He looked genuinely hurt, glum and uninspired, giving Amonas a picture
 of how he must've looked a couple of hours before.
 The thought sobered his mood, and thought he had better make Hilderich
 bounce back from what must have been a seriously rude awakening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was keeping silent, casting a look of rightful accusation at Amonas,
 who thought it a little childish and perhaps somewhat unbecoming of a man.
 But their situation was indeed unique and perhaps he was asking too much
 of the man already.
 He cast those blemished thoughts aside and instead spoke from the heart,
 seeking to calm Hilderich and soothe his fear:

I am sorry I left you alone, but I could not sleep.
 I went for a walk, but I was close by.
 I heard you when you called, didn't I? I could not have been very far.
 You were as safe as I could vouch for in such a place.
 So please, accept my apologies and think no more of it.
 It only helps to aggravate you, and lower your spirits.
 Here, have some of this.

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas reached into his small sack and brought out a small roundish object
 covered in what seemed to be something like hair, thin strands of wood
 or brown parched grass.
 He used his knife to chop off a small slice from its top, then offered
 it to Hilderich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich made a gesture to take the proferred little ball, which looked
 to be white on the inside, but he shook his head and gave it back to Amonas,
 a hesitant look on his face, a quavering quality in his voice:

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' pride was stung, since Hilderich seemed to imply that he might be
 trying to poison him.
 He was about to go off on a rant unbefitting his character, about how misguided
 and foolish a person must to still be unable to trust him after what has
 befallen them, but wisely decided against that.
 After his initial surprise and shock lifted from his expression, he took
 the strange cross between a hairy nut and a fruit in his hands, and drank
 a good mouthful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After he had quite thoroughly sloshed it around his mouth in an evident
 display of the juice's potable quality, he swallowed and offered it back
 to Hilderich who accepted it, even though still reluctantly, sniffing the
 watery liquid inside the strange fruit.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was motioning with his head for Hilderich to drink, urging him to
 just have a taste, while Hilderich slowly brought the fruit to his lips,
 eyeing Amonas warily at the some time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a brief pause and a small period of uncertainty, Hilderich finally
 took a small sip, swallowed, and then surprising even himself in the process,
 proceeded to empty the small ball of a fruit of its watery content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas grinned in a relaxed manner, and as he laid down to the ground to
 enjoy at least a few minutes, he said to Hilderich after closing his eyes
 and covering his face with one arm, the other resting at his stomach:

Hilderich's tone was rather that of a grudging complaint rather than gross
 accusation.
 He might be right, Amonas thought, but now was not the time to settle such
 a score.
 He hoped that they would make it back, become friends, and Hilderich would
 forgive him for the misfortunes brought upon him.
 But until then, Amonas' patience would be tried and tested at almost every
 chance.
 He replied in kind, eyes still covered by his arm:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought had occurred to him, but he had not given it much thought.
 With the death of his master and half-way in his apprenticeship, he was
 now considered, officially, though without seat, a Curator, with all the
 rights and responsibilities his office carried.
 It was certainly not an apt time, but he felt somewhat proud, and suddenly
 all too grown up and a bit older than he thought possible.
 Amonas added as an afterthought:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Don't fret over it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded silently and appreciatively, before heading off to a nearby
 log of wood, half of it rotting away, creeping with maggots and worms,
 what he had been taught was the basis of a healthy and fertile ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time passed quickly for Hilderich, who uncovered all sorts of different
 layers of decaying wood, noticing the wood's grain, the various kinds of
 insects that used it as housing, food, or what seemed to be a combination
 of the two, eating tunnels through it on which then they laid eggs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was fascinating, he thought, to witness a whole civilization of insects
 in its various stages and levels unfolding in front of you in a simple
 piece of wood, right in front of your eyes, at your very hands.
 How tempting it felt to push the eggs around, see how the insects would
 react, or douse them with water and see whether they'd drown.
 But he was taught that nature knew best, and men could only learn from
 it, not change it.
 At least not for better.
 So he let the insects be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he did so and paused his study of the insect-ridden log, he noticed
 Amonas had quietly awoken, seemingly quite refreshed and energised.
 He asked him if he had slept well, to which Amonas answered after briefly
 thinking about it:
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Good enough.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas then made some broth of what he had found to be adequate substitute
 for uwe, and sipped appreciatively.
 As before, he offered some to Hilderich who again politely refused, but
 did not resort to his small flask of gin.
 He wisely assumed that they would need more of it to light up a fire, and
 more than just once.
 So he kept Amonas quiet company, until they would move on again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once they did, Amonas led the way once more with quite deliberation, carefully
 choosing his path as if he could smell their destination however afar it
 might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Hilderich, it was unfathomable how any man could navigate practically
 blindly, without a map or a solid point of reference, simply by hunch and
 a general feeling of direction, both even more easily fooled in a chaotic
 mass of vegetation such as the one they were entangled in currently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Amonas felt Hilderich needed time to rest, he paused, and made sure
 Hilderich was ready to move on before they set off again.
 Hilderich felt quietly thankful of that small matter and made every effort
 to proceed in a timely manner, never dallying too long, until either they
 had walked for the better part of what would amount to a day in this accursed
 place, or until they had reached the bull-horned building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heat was as always unbearable and the moisture nearly debilitating,
 but they trudged along, hoping to strike lucky soon.
 If nothing else, Hilderich hoped they would soon rest for what should have
 been night time.
 Lost in thought and numbed by fatigue, Hilderich bumped unwillingly onto
 Amonas, who seemed to have suddenly stopped.
 Hilderich apologised curtly and asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pardon me for running onto you like you were made of air, but why have we
 stopped? Are we here yet? I can't see anything like a wall or stones or
 something resembling a construction.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's voice had an unmistakably pleading quality, and though it would
 be indeed great if they had reached their intented destination, it would
 be nothing short of bliss if they would stop and sleep for now.
 Amonas knew what Hilderich was thinking from the look on his face and the
 expectancy in his voice, and replied with a question:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was about to make some comment in the same vein as the previous
 one, complaining about sore feet and an empty stomach, not to mention a
 dried out mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But once he paused for little more than a moment, he felt it.

 As he tried to make sense of it, Amonas added:

Well it's not chilly.
 It's not that hot, cool would be a better choice of words.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas laughed out heartily at that display of good-humoured single-mindedness,
 and feeling his spirits lifted, laid down and started singing a tune his
 grandfather used to sing when they were fishing together, down by the river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was complaining that his stomach felt empty, and that they had
 not secured a source of fresh water.
 He also heard some grumblings about him doing all the really necessary
 stuff, and that Curators should be treated respectfully rather than being
 ignored profoundly.
 He stated that he would nevertheless procure some sort of food since he
 was the only reliable and responsible person in this world which might
 or might not be an entirely different one from the one they called home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas kept on singing heedless of Hilderich's protests, thinking he would
 be soundly asleep before he had time to finish the song came to a finish.
 As the moments went by, his voice became softer and shallower, and then
 he stopped altogether.
 Indeed, within moments he fell into a slumber, where he dreamt of Celia,
 and in the dream he could feel the cool breeze that was her smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pretty soon, he was snoring heavily, as if he had not a worry in this or
 any other world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Meetings and Greetings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had woken as early as every day, giving thanks to God for allowing him
 to live and breathe once more, and greeted the suns as they rose with a
 hearty smile.
 His hair was as always tousled, gently swayed by the light breeze coming
 down from the mountains and onto the plains that filled his entire view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once more he had used his walking stone to guide him, and before noon had
 passed he entered the Land of God proper.
 He had been warned to be wary of these lands, for not everything that roamed
 it was gracced by God, and not all that he may encounter was sent by Him
 alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The devious others had plans of their own, and would likely oppose him when
 they saw fit.
 He should steel himself wholeheartedly if he were to carry on with his
 Pilgrimage, and meet his ineffable destiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he did step foot on the widelands, it was as the elders had said it
 would be: A flat and uninviting country, with low grass and trees few and
 afar, the sounds of animals and birds lost in an emptiness that defied
 the senses and made one humble and awestruck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the True Path appeared in its glistening beauty and perfection, as
 had done so many times before.
 He was witnessing the path to his own destiny, and soon he was walking
 on it, treading lightly and with reverance, whenever possible, but making
 haste and good speed, for what good was the path, if he dawdled on it for
 longer than prudence would allow?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As his peregrination took him further into the Land of God, his thoughts
 coalesced bit by bit into how this land was perhaps purposefully designed,
 meant to evoke ascetic feelings.
 Civilization in any form had been kept away from the Land of God, as if
 it had prordained that these lands would forever be a sanctum, a land devoted
 to praising God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a land indeed forbidden to most mortal men, uninviting, almost hostile
 as far as he could tell until now.
 And the Path was there, a clear sign of God's design, a Path for true believers
, a Path for those that came with holy fire burning in their heart, searching
 for God, a divine purpose guiding them deeper into a land that would normally
 kill a man of hunger, thirst or pure exhaustion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance lacked meaning in the Land of God, which almost defied logic in
 its flatness, its emptiness, an emptiness only the love of God and faith
 in him could fill.
 A terrible void that shrank the impure soul and made an unwilling mind
 recoil in awe, a land that turned the unbeliever away, a land where the
 mandate of God was carried ever more strongly by the formidable gusts of
 wind that sweeped its every acre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed magnificent to behold, the will of God made manifest all around
 him, a sacred place that he was not only allowed, but indeed expected to
 traverse to its very heart, and complete his Pilgrimage, as his God and
 his people demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
God, in his inestimable wisdom had prepared the land more than well enough
 for a believer, for someone who lived and died with His name upon his lips,
 His thought in his mind and His image in depths of his soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water, he could find in the small damp spots around the Path, when night
 fell and a hazy carpet of fog crept across the immeasurably flat land.
 He would dig, with either his hands or a small flat piece of rock, and
 he would find a few mouthfuls of water to sustain him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when he felt hungry and tired, his strength about to leave him, as if
 God kept an ever watchful eye on him from afar, a small thin bush laden
 with tiny berries would appear near the road, or a small colony of ants
 or some other kind of insect he could eat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He always thanked God for these small mercies that kept him fit and healthy,
 that kept him going without delays, other than a few brief stops and some
 much needed sleep.
 His clothing was good for the Holy Land as it was for the lands where his
 people dwelt.
 Perhaps it was not as cold during the day, but the nights became colder
 the farther deep he went while following the Path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept the wise council of his elders, and never strayed off the road.
 He kept on it at all times, and when he could, when leaving it to get to
 a source of water or find something to eat, he would always leave his walking
 stone on it, with a piece of woolen string attached to it, laying it behind
 him as he walked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then when he had drank or filled his belly, he would pick up the string
 and walk right back to the Path and the wlaking stone.
 It was said, that if one strayed off the Path, he might never find it again
 for as long as he walked the Land of God.
 It was blasphemy, for the Path to be revealed to you and then choose to
 leave it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he would lay behind him a piece of string, to always connect himself
 with the Path, even when not directly on it.
 And that he would do by strict necessity, and only after solemn prayer
 in which he would beg for forgiveness and recognize his own imperfection
 and crude humanity that had afflicted him with the feeling of hunger and
 thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, he hoped and prayed, God would not be offended and would find it in
 his heart like a loving father to allow the Path to remain, to guide his
 faithful servant on to his Holy destination, beyond all the hardships and
 dangers that might arise in his quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For if it was a simple, sheltered matter, it would matter not at all how
 the Pilgrimage was made.
 Anyone would walk about the Holy Lands, especially the deceitful liars
 and archenemies of Gods and their followers, soiling the land and air with
 their mere breaths and unclean feet, poisoning the very air with their
 hideous laughter and venomous lies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, it was not a simple affair walking through the Land of God.
 And that was why he kept praying each and ever waking moment, to thank
 his God for his magnanimous and benevolent nature, to thank him for allowing
 to draw breath, and drink water as he needed it, and feast upon the fruit
 and the very life of His Land, for his heart to keep beating, for his hands
 to touch the Holy Soil without being struck down, without being deemed
 unworthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was almost dusk, on the third day since he had set foot on the Land of
 God.
 It was once more time for prayer.
 He laid down his small sack, and took off his cloak, setting it down in
 front of him.
 He then kneeled on the cloak, and closed his eyes, his arms resting on
 his legs, the palms of his hands touching his knees.
 He then started bowing down low, his forehead touching the Path every time,
 whispered words of reverence coming out of his mouth, in the tongue of
 God which they no longer used, but kept handing down as holy passages,
 from mouth to mouth, and generation to generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he could not understand what the words were saying, he could feel
 their perfection rippling through the air, Holy words spoken in the Land
 of God, like a river mingling with the sea.
 A small trickle of divinity flowing onto the essence of God made manifest,
 the air, earth and water resonating with godly purpose and sancrosanct
 silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence His words, the Holy Mantra, which should normally be shouted aloud
 for all of Creation to bear witness to his grandeur and wisdom.
 In the Holy Land, in His Land, His Domain, it would be sacrilege to utter
 them in anything above a whisper.
 For every grain of sand, and every wisp of air, every drop of water carried
 everything back to him, voice, thought and deed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he bowed in homage to the creation of God all around him, grandiose,
 majestic, striking chords buried deep inside his very essence and soul,
 he felt pride in his heritage, his people, his purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He cast it swiftly aside, since pride was a double-edged blade, ready to
 cut into him when he would feel invincible, safe, powerful and righteous.
 That was not God's way; God taught humility, wisdom, faith, belief and
 love.
 Not pride, arrogance and lust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Holy Land was indeed a place to be wary.
 Even in paying homage to God, the ruinous ones could find a man's weakness
 and seep inside him, all the while he believed he was walking the True
 Path.
 The Path is not just this white, slick and unending road; it is a state
 of mind and soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He made the sign of God with his outstretched palms facing towards the falling
 suns, the rising moon a faint gossamer red shadow in the hazy distance,
 where only the line of the dark crimson horizon could be identified with
 difficulty over the misty green and yellow of the rising mist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood up on his two feet and wore his cloak, picking up his sack and
 setting off down the road once again.
 As the chilly night rushed to meet him, he thought he could see a figure
 like a mirror of himself walking on the road towards him.
 He squinted his eyes as tried to make sense of what he was seeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a man, not very much unlike him, lean and not very tall.
 His stride seemed purposeful, and if he had taken notice of him walking
 on the Path, he showed no sign of alarm, surprise or fear.
 It was as if he would go on nevertheless, as if he was nothing but a phantom,
 an apparition of the Holy Lands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But maybe this was what he was seeing.
 Stranger things had been heard around the lifestones during the coldest
 nights at his peoples' gatherings.
 It would not be without precedent that he should meet a ghost of the Holy
 Lands, perhaps some other Pilgrim before him who wandered the Holy Lands
 and warned the Pilgrims and the faithful, guided them through danger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps he was a messenger from God Himself, though it might be presumptuous,
 even blasphemous, to think that God would seek to aid him in such straightforwa
rd ways that completely and blatantly proved his Divine existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he reminded himself to be wary, perhaps he was a ruinous force indisguise,
 an servant of those that would alwys be evil and would seek to corrupt
 men and everything good and wholesome that he tried to protect from their
 rotting grasp and insidious machinations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, he was just a man, a believer like him, brave enough to seek out
 God.
 He would soon find out whether he should strike him or greet him like a
 brother should.
 He was quite closer by now, and he thought it prudent to make some sort
 of sign, to announce himself properly, like a man in the Holy Land should
 greet a fellow man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped and stood still, and then made the sign of God, touching his
 bowed forehead with one straight palm, offering his other hand, showing
 his clear, empty palm.
 What the gesture meant to those familiar with it, or those of pure mind
 and soul, was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am a man blessed with God's gift, a mind of my own.
 I carry no weapon, I am your brother.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man walking towards him slowed his pace, visibly trying to discern the
 gesture.
 Then he responded in kind, first with a deep bow towards the sinking suns,
 then with the same sign, albeit with the opposite hands, mirroring the
 Pilgrim's motion.
 A true believer then, or some instrument of God.
 His blessings were countless, his heart leapt with joy at such a sight.
 A brotherly soul, here in the Land of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim smiled widely, and picked up his pace to meet with his brother
 from afar.
 He could see the man coming towards him smile as well, his face lit up
 with enthusiasm and surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the faint light of the crimson moon they met each other, faces visibly
 ridden with the signs of hardship only a believer would endure to prove
 his love of God, and stay true to his faith.
 Brothers joined by belief, sharing the creation of God, walking on the
 Path.
 What joyous occasion such a meeting of brotherly souls, in the Holy Land
 no less!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were standing opposite each other, and the man in front of him, the
 man who he had seen walking up towards him was younger, leaner, and taller
 than he had glimpsed at first.
 In the light of dusk it was easy to misjudge the shape and size of things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The young man proferred his hand, and spoke a few words in Helican.
 The Pilgrim didn't speak Helican, had actually never heard it before in
 his lifetime.
 He was thinking the man talking in front of him must have uttered a greeting,
 or announced his name.
 He seemed friendly, unassuming and harmless.
 He might be speaking in weird tongues, but he made the sign of God.
 A brother under God's view is brother enough.
 The Pilgrim closed his eyes and nodded with acceptance, hands outstretched
 to his left and right.

The Pilgrim thought it proper to answer in kind, in the tongue of God, even

The Pilgrim look at him puzzled.
 His brother was as excited for their meeting as he was, he could tell.
 But he was so outspoken, so emphatic and energetic.
 He seemed to have forgotten about paying proper respect in the Holy Land,
 his voice loud and his expression wild, his body almost hyperactive, tense
 with motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, he could not understand a single word the man said, even though he
 seemed to have repeated a question at least once.
 He might be asking where I'm coming from, or where I'm going, the Pilgrim

He seemed just a long lost brother, the language he spoke altogether different,
 as so were his customs pertaining to the reverence of God.
 He was quite different, but he hoped he was indeed a brother as he had

 thwart him and his Pilgrimage, to mock God and his divine plan.

He would not allow himself to fall for such cheap tricks, and his wary eye

 For now, he would treat him as a brother, and offer God his prayer, seeking
 forgiveness for thinking such accusing thoughts even in a time that should
 be joyous, for a brother, he hoped, had been found.
 He smiled, and motioned his hands to the sky, head slightly bowed and a
 thin but heary smile on his lips, his voice clear and true:

Though he was starting to find some common sounds, he had not the wisdom

His new brother looked in disbelief, somewhat dumbfounded, his hand pointing

Sleep never came that night to her.
 Her tears flowed freely for the better part.
 She stifled the worst of the sobs and moans that welled up from her insides,
 but still she wept.
 By morning her face was that of an older woman, eyeslids swollen from the
 crying and sleeplessness.
 She felt horrible, the child within her seemed equally disturbed.
 How could it not be, if its mother was in such a terrible state?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had left her windows closed, drapes and curtains tightly drawn shut.
 She cared not whether the suns had risen, and a new day had dawned.
 She wept for her only love, the one half that matter most in the world.
 The other half, his own half as well, was stirring uneasily in her belly.
 She tried to think comforting thoughts but all she managed was to utter
 with a croak:

She wandered aimlessly from their bedroom, to their kitchen, every once
 in a while hugging herself as if vainly trying to land herself in Amonas'
 arms.
 But to no avail, he would not appear out of thin air.
 And still she cried, at times silently with tears welling up in her eyes,
 and other times fitfully, the sobs that she could not contain released
 in languish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She pined for the father of her unborn child, to hold him and caress his
 face.
 To kiss their fears and troubles away.
 But he was not there.
 He was nowhere, it seemed.
 As if he had been spirited away, by the same sort of devils that had caught
 poor Philo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But no body had been found, and none had come for her or her child.
 Philo would never talk, he would never give up his blood brother, his mentor,
 his friend.
 She suddenly felt a pang of fear in her heart, as if it had been struck
 violently, nearly coming to a halt.
 Was the child safe with her? Did she need to run, run like the wind and
 the winter streams? Disappear like she had never existed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what about Amonas? What happened to her love? She could not for one
 second think of him as no more, as dead, as a body limp and unmoving.
 He must be alive, somewhere.
 In hiding, running for his life.
 And he had that other man with him.
 He would be running to protect him as well.
 That was why he hadn't come forward to her, or sent a message that he was
 well and alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must have been a matter of secrecy.
 How tired she had grown of all these dark affairs, so many lies upon lies.
 The lies they had sworn to break and burn away, those very lies were what
 kept them alive, probably.
 What irony, to have had your life built around what you despised most.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the only way, they had kept telling to themselves.
 The only way they could change things once and for all, the only way they

 And this was the way he was gone now.
 Perhaps forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dark thought contorted her face into a mixture of anger, pain and weeping
 sorrow.
 She held her head in her palms, sobbing silently.
 She was constantly going through the same phases: Sorrow, then anger, then
 a faint sliver of hope would dawn upon her and recollect her thoughts,
 compose herself somewhat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then fear would grip her once more, uncertainty for her child would
 sweep everything clean, and the vicious circle of gripping emotions and
 harrowing memories of happier times would start anew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And she would weep and cry and throw herself against the walls until she
 could stand it no more; and then she would think of her loved one that
 might be dead and would never live to kiss her again, and hold his child
 in his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then she would weep once more, all the tears of the world coursing down
 her cheeks, like she was amidst the torrent of pain and anguish that ran
 throughout every living thing.
 She would suffer until noone had suffered before, and it would not stop
 until she either died herself, or her love was standing right in front
 her, calling her to his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The child stirred within, as if it was calling out to her, as if fear had
 touched it deep inside, past the warmth of his mother's belly, and chill
 crept up all around it.
 She tried to soothe her child, and inspite herself started to sing an ode
 to the streams and fields, a song of merry melody, something that would
 have Amonas smiling and laughing within moments.
 She would not cry at the thought, nor think him long gone.
 She would sing it in quiet waiting, and strong hope.
 She would sing it for their child's sake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so she did, and her voice echoed in her empty house, which suddenly
 felt brighter, warm and full of charming smells, like cinammon and naristhel,
 and lermentis leaves, and honeyspice and mint.
 All those smells that brought the senses joy, and a smile on their face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The child felt quiet now, the singing had relieved it of fear and brought
 back the warmth in its heart.
 It felt like it was asleep now, comfortable in its mother's womb, who herself
 felt soothed, her fears cast away for the moment, her hope shining more
 bright, her heart beating with renewed vigor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her mind was filled with thoughts: He would be alright, Amonas.
 He would be fighting or running all the way back to me, like the lovely
 fool he is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She strolled around the house for a while, thinking that she could not longer
 sit here idle and miserable.
 She had to find out what had happened, see for herself.
 After all, she felt she was not safe sitting here anymore.
 Neither her nor their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It sounded a foolhardy and unnecessarily risky, her mind told her.
 But her mother's instinct shouted that she should run away, find another
 shelter.
 Somewhere where she might give birth as safely as possible.
 She was due anytime soon, each day could be the day their child would be
 born.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her condition made moving all the more difficult so she would require some
 assistance in her endeavor.
 She thought about moving out to the countryside, take what coin she could
 and find some good people, some family to take her in, at least until she
 gave birth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But things were about to get hectic, she knew.
 And soon there would be very few people that she could trust.
 Amonas had chosen to keep her well away from the happenings and goings
 of the Kinsfolk, so she had only met and knew Philo, who was supposed to
 be her guardian and protector should anything happen to Amonas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had been frightened at the thought, but had accepted it as a realistic
 precaution.
 The irony now was that with Amonas missing, and her protector arrested
 she would have to fend for herself.
 Poor Philo, what horrible fate must await him at the hands of those tyrants?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She would have to turn to the Kinsfolk for their help.
 At this time of need, with an uprising boiling right under her feet, the
 child almost on its way, what should she do? Run away, fearing for their
 lives everyday? Never knowing who to trust, with every possibility of war
 raging throughout the territories? No, it would be foolish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She might have been foolish with her own life before, before she was graced
 with Amonas' and her child, but now she would give her all to protect her
 child.
 And this was her best bet, find the kinsfolk before all of Pyr turned into
 a nightmare, and stay with them until this nightmare was ended and a new
 day dawned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For better or for worse, she would be amongst friends, free men and women,
 brothers and fellow believers in the just and right.
 It was time she accepted that there would be nowhere safer than right in
 the heart of things, where the revolution was about to spring out from
 like a restless stream.
 A revolution more like a mad, furious river overflowing with the tears
 of the downtrodden, the poor and wretched, the ones that were made to disappear
 in the middle of the night, their cries haunting the streets like ghosts
 trapped in a hellish afterlife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That knowledge, the knowledge of the deeply rooted injustice, the tyrannical
 masterminds of the Ruling Council, the lies and deceit spread through the
 ministers, all with the same purpose of breeding sterile and harmless minds
 like sheep, all that made her subscribe to Amonas' purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw the truth behind his words, behind every poor beggar and every blind
 former soldier, every child dying of hunger and every old man hanged for
 blasphemy and sin that no God would allow, if he had anything at all to
 do with the real world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that steeled her, and made her finally decide.
 She would seek out the kinsfolk and actively join them and participate
 in any manner that she could.
 Not just for the safety of her unborn child, but for its future life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She knew then instinctively that Amonas would have been proud for her right
 now.
 Making such a decision.
 Not out of a childish conception of bravery, or duty or a vainglorious
 attempt at posterity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But because she genuinely cared, she actually hoped and wanted their child
 to grow up a free person, not bound anymore, not a cripple in mind or soul,
 but a person free to build his own destiny, free from oppression of the
 spirit, free from misconceptions and prejudice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A person that could think of his own, decide for himself, live in a world

 Someone that could dream of reaching out of the stars without fear of being
 damned as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a raving madman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it was a boy, she thought to herself and smiled, she would like him to
 be like his father, but not too much.
 Carve his own destiny, raise a family of his own, set the example to those
 around him, be cherished and loved.
 He could be anything, an artist, a poet or a painter, and he could put
 down on paper and canvas the feelings, emotions and thoughts none had dared
 so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could be a man of reason and logic, and make something useful out of
 things like steamers.
 And think of new, exciting and purposeful uses to make the lives of people
 easier, and carefree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew in the end he would be a wonderful man, just like his father.
 Who he will meet and grow to cherish and love, the man who will help him
 become happy and whole in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She smiled at how she corrected herself even in her thoughts, and bit her
 lip thinking what it would be like if the child was a girl.
 She would be born a free woman, and she would have all the time in the
 world to become what she wished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She could become so many things that would have been unthinkable before.
 She could become the thinker and the tinkerer, and then her baby brother
 the dancer, like his mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These thoughts of merry prospect brought her glee and her face shone.
 She could not wait for Amonas' to return.
 She now felt it would be impossible for him to miss the birth of his firstborn.
 She would tell him all about her plans when they met again.
 After she had smothered him with kisses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first things first, and that blessed reunion would have to wait.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She picked a rather small sack, and carefully picked up some things she
 would either need or would miss terribly.
 Some letters from Amonas, that would also serve as proof he was her husband,
 if it came to that.
 The flute he had carved for her, which she played to him on the colder
 nights, the both of them wrapped together under heavy sheets, playing endlessly
 until the break of dawn, and making love without a care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then a few clothes, her nightgown and a blanket or two, in case she
 had to spent a few nights on the road.
 She packed some leftover breadpie from yesterday, and remembered to fill
 a flask of water from the well before she would be off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be best not to tell anyone, not even dear Rovenia.
 It would do her no good to upset her and make her worry without being able
 to help in any way.
 Once she was gone, it would not be long before the revolution proper began
 and then noone would be safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be best if she warned her somehow, but what could the poor lady
 do if she knew of the gathering storm? This house was all that she had
 left, no spouse or children to speak of.
 She would stay, Celia thought, whether there was a rebellion going on or
 not.
 Then again, she had proven to be somewhat of a rebel herself.
 Cinnamon breadpie on a Watchday! An audacious old lady, indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her small sack was packed to the brim, ready to burst.
 Outside dusk was falling, but she would wait for the night sky to appear,
 when it would be easier for her to find the men she was looking for.
 She would try some of the places they had met with Philo, some inns and
 some artisan's stalls that stayed open past the usual times, in the corners
 of the market were most avoided because of their ill reputation.
 She would take a large kitchen knife, just for good measue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She might not look like it, bloated belly and all, but she could move real
 fast.
 A dancer, a really good dancer like her, has certain qualities that can
 be put in more than one use.
 At that thought she brought up a particularly fond memory, and giggled
 inspite herself, like a little infatuated girl.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, he would be back and she would scold him properly for leaving her alone
 like that.
 A pregnant woman mere days before being due, a world-shattering uprising
 in the works, and the husband, off on a tour!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She suddenly broke down in tears, the tension that had kept her going suddenly
 released.
 The fear and uncertainty did not return, but she felt she should slap herself
 for trying to lose herself in forgetfullness, act is if nothing serious
 was happening, like she could be all play and games when she saw him again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She composed herself and stopped crying, and let the tears down her cheek
 run dry.
 This was all deadly serious, and he might be dead.
 She knew it in her heart he wasn't, but she had already learned life could
 be so full of surprises, and not all of them good.
 So she turned her heart into ice, and gave the thought some possibility,
 which only made her cold and distant from her usual self.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that moment, she took a vow on her life and the life of her child, that
 she would fight in any manner or way possible, for the future freedom of
 her child, and if things were so, in memory of her loving husband, Amonas
 Ptolemy, to honour his legacy and offspring, as he would have wanted so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time passed slowly, and she grasped the opportunity to have a last look
 around their house.
 Their bedroom, were he had loved her with passion and care, sometimes a
 strong lover, unyielding, discovering every inch of her body with a conqueror's
 lust.
 Other times, he was soft, mellow, caring and delicate, like the gentle
 breeze that caresses the flowers and meadows and flows freely wherever
 it pleases, always welcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was here where their child was conceived.
 It must have been one of the coldest nights, when he took her under the
 sheets and made her forget the world existed, in such a way that she could
 not remember now whether it was truth or fantasy.
 The child in her womb though was real enough, his seed taking place well
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was caressing her belly absent-mindedly when she walked through her
 kitchen, the wood stove unlit, the fireplace glum and silent.
 It was as if the room itself mourned her leaving.
 She would miss all the times she would prepare their meals with loving
 warmth, making sure there was always uwe on the table in one or another.

\begin_layout Standard
She had been quietly absorbed in thought, her gaze fixed someplace irrelevant,
 when she happened to look outside the street.
 Night had finally fallen.
 It was time she left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She lit up a single candle in their bedroom, at their window sill, as if
 in memory of the time they had spent together, gathered her small sack
 and went outside, careful to close the door behind her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She noticed lady Rovenia must have been outside, because she could see no
 candle lit.
 Perhaps she was already asleep, early to rise, early to bed.
 She thought she should have said goodbye, but it might be for the best
 in the end.
 Her love went out to her as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon she was mingling with the night crowds of Pyr, common pyres lighting
 up the streets and the more lively parts of the market, were stalls sold
 meats and some women sold their bodies.
 One could find anything he desired in the market of Pyr, as long as one
 searched hard enough in the right places, that much she knew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On her way to one of the inns, she noticed she was attracting unwanted attention
; surely it seemed that a pregnant woman should not be walking outside in
 the market all alone.
 She should have thought to somehow cover her belly, accomodate for her
 shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All she could really do now was try and stay in the shadows.
 With one hand she clutched her sack over her back, and with the other her
 solid kitchen knife.
 She felt she was ready for violence, but she couldn't be sure if the need
 did not arise, and she dearly hoped it didn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, she reached one of the inn's she remembered Amonas saying were
 more than sympathetic to their cause.
 It was one of the few places she had seen Philo in public, and when she
 did it was indeed more of a social gathering, a few friends enjoying a
 drink together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed more than strange, in some cases depending on the circumstances
 and the phase of the moon literally a sin, for a woman to have a drink

 client would.

Those who did not return to their drinks and kept on pointing, some even
 calling her names, she ignored in an exemplary fashion.

She motioned to her to stand behind his bar.
 He gestured with one hand for her to wait there, and she indulged him so.
 He went around the tables, filling up the cups of his customers with beer,
 wine, meade and spirit, each one to his poison.
 After he had a second look, he leaned over the bar and told her in hushed
 tones, imparting hidden knowledge:

She nodded in acknowledgement and the innkeeper ventured a smile, revealing
 a few bad and broken teeth, and a silver one that must have cost him a

She cast a few guilty looks around as if she was about to try something

She threw down her small sack first, and then carefully placed her feet
 on the steps one after the other, her large belly giving her a little bit

Until she had time enough to look around, the innkeeper showed himself,
 coming down the same way she did moments earlier.
 He was a short but sturdy man, thick red moustache and a slightly bald

 Since we know Philo and Amonas were probably betrayed we must also assume
 you are not safe in the streets.

Nevertheless, she was following Rewe's steps through what appeared to be
 a hidden door, cut away in the dirt, a small tunnel of sorts.
 Rewe had produced a torch from some place only he knew where to find in

 small stone.
 Rewe took notice of her surprise and told her kindly:

Amonas thought if it came to that and he was not around, you were quite

She was surprised and felt both proud and slightly put off.
 Amonas would not abandone her or the child like that.

Indeed, Rewe opened up his pace and soon they were walking rather briskly

\begin_layout Standard
Celia nodded with acceptance, and they had now reached a crossroads of tunnels.
 Rewe then used the torch as some sort of knocking apparatus.
 He used it to knock on what seemed to be finely cut limestone, in a series
 of rhythmic knocks using pauses in between, as if playing part of a tune.
 Some kind of code, she guessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, a strange kind of challenge sounded, a series of knocks from the
 other side of the limestone.
 Rewe seemed to pause for a while, and then proceeded with a different series
 of knocks.
 The limestone slab was slowly pushed aside, and strong candle light filled
 the underground tunnels.
 A small simple wooden ladder was lowered, and Rewe motioned Celia to climb
 it.
 Silently, he bowed and waved her goodbye before losing himself back the
 way they had come.
 Celia squinted at the bright light as she came up the stairs, onto what
 seemed to be a very plush kind of cellar, with exquisite bronze and silver
 decorations on the walls.
 A whole wall devoted to grand collection of what seemed to be wine bottles.
 A smiling old man in a luxurious servant's suit complete with velvet vest
 was the sole occupant.
 He seemed a rather upstanding and polite man who helped her make the last
 steps up the stairs, offering his hands as support.
 She looked rather mystified at her whereabouts, and as she was ready to
 ask the venerable servant where she was, probably his long experience and
 hard years of service prompted him to greet her before she had time to
 open her mouth:

A fool's resolve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrledge was as was pertinent and indeed unavoidable over the past few days
 in his minute office, sitting at his desk, piles of reports and inventories
 stacked in front of him as high as his forehead.
 The minutiae of a preparation for complete mobilisation were indeed innumerable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personnel manifests, rotation forecasts, materiel inventories, requisition
 forms, count practicals, soldier and officer levies, clothing requests,
 workshop and mill necessitation orders, movement and guard formations,
 forced labor documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these, and quite some more kinds of papers and formal scrolls had
 to reviewed, amended if needed, edited, signed, forwarded, then signed
 again and scribed, before sent out in a seemingly never-ending vicious
 cycle of bureaucracy and stale ministry procedures, designed to triple
 check and record everything that went on, making sure nothing seemed to
 stray in weird, unexplored territory that would alarm the various officials
 and by natural order the Archminister himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this paperwork and mind-boggling interdepartmental anarchy had the general
 sitting wide-eyed at his desk, papers strewn all over his desk, a carpet
 of ink and white that made his head dizzy merely by looking at it, much
 less reading it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He leaned over and put his elbows on the desk, resting his head on his hands,
 gently massaging it as if that would make the terrible headache go away.
 All this had him thinking about his carreer in the army in general.
 He somehow wished he could go back in time and almost fail at pretty much
 everything, and get Gomermont's job for a change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead he leaned again back on his chair, the muscles in his back stiff
 from constantly sitting and signing since early dawn.
 His wrist hurt like he had been practicing with a sword since yesterday.
 He looked at the plain and unadorned ceiling, his eyes out of focus, and
 seemed to ponder deeply the state of affairs he was in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The army had been metaphorically, though almost literally at times, handcuffed
 and thrown around like a useful but dangerous idiot for almost ever since
 its inception and creation.
 The hindrances and bureaucratic steps that are constantly battling the
 army and its people are designed in such a way as to extend the period
 of time it takes for troops to assemble, equip and move, from days onto
 weeks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept was thoroughly and widely known as a safety measure against
 people in the army trying to achieve power through strength of arms, perhaps
 even change the balance of power within the Ruling Council to include the
 General of the Army.

There had been precedents surely, but that was another time entirely, when
 the Territories were still young and the people dumbfounded by the new
 emerging order of the world, one common rule for all, under one religion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was bound to be some dissidence, some kind of resistance.
 It was well known that even the earth opposes the river's flow, but the

 So it came to be that Shar the Traitor only achieved in permanently making

 be their exalted souls.

\begin_layout Standard
And so I'm stuck here, he thought, trying to build a machine of war faster
 than what is conceived possible, with almost anything and anyone at my
 disposal, except from freedom of action and the ability to ask for things

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even with the help from the Archminister that had indeed expedited some
 processes, Tyrledge was experiencing significant delays in most of his
 petitions and requisitions.
 It all had to sift through the gargantuan train of Ministry processes,
 officials and hearings, disappear in its labyrinth offices, clerk pits
 and then back up again through the same path, in order to probably, but
 not always most likely, end up in something useful and tangible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more he thought about it, the more incredulous it all seemed, but it
 was manifestly real.
 The other day, he just remembered, he had received a notice of an annuled
 material request for a shipment of chisels required for the maintenance
 and construction of most of the siege engines.
 The ministry's reasoning behind the annulment was mystifying at best:
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed the ministry was contemplating whether or not a military coup
 could put chisels to good use, in preference to the usual swords, scimitars,
 bows, steamers, slingshots, siege engines and the good old knives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their lack of trust was crippling.
 He was given a colossal task that was daily compounded with the burden
 of the ministry's schizophrenic tendencies that balanced precariously between
 gross, outright denial and a maniacal urge to have everyting done and ready
 armed merely with ink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The archminister had been quite unable to help, since this was how everything
 worked and reiterating the jumbling mass of ministry people to adopt new
 sound practices in a matter of days was just as inconceivable as totally
 circumventing the antiquated ministry machine.
 In essence, he was caught between a hammer and an anvil.
 With nowhere else to go, he knew he would have to endure.
 He could feel the pressure though, and it was rising to a crushing level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got up from his office and decided to have a little stroll outside.
 Maybe some fresh air would invigorate him.
 As he left his office, his aide-de-camp and various other officer belonging
 to his immediate staff saluted crisply, most of them with papers and ink
 in hand, designated to handle some of the bureaucracy whose scale defied
 that of behemoths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He left orders for his aide-de-camp that he was not to be disturbed or communica
ted to in any way while he was out having his walk.
 Anything it was it would have to wait for him, not the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He might not have a vote on the Council, but he didn't like being pushed
 around like a junior officer after 45 years of humble and devoted service.
 It felt wrong, that was the word.
 Plain wrong.
 He reached for someone's mug of fresh uwe and without a nod or excuse just
 picked it up and went outside in the clear cold air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked casually over the throngs of artisans, labourers and soldiers
 going about their frantic work.
 The artisans were terribly busy constructing breakable, portable siege
 engines, refurbishing and testing the steamers that had fallen in prolonged
 disuse.
 Even with the sudden influx of forced skilled and unskilled labor, he could
 easily discern they were behind schedule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the background to the main staging area of the army, labourers were hard
 at work ferrying ore from the nearby Ilo and Rohms mines.
 The mines were working at full capacity non-stop, the noble families that
 were allowed to operate the mines failing to reach the needed production.
 Already, procastinators teamed up with squads of army men were instructed
 to gang-press as many people as needed to meet the allotted quotas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were less than ten days left before the army was expected to march
 fully armed with the maximum strength of trained men.
 There were still thousands of weapons and pieces of armor to be made, which
 meant more and more ore each day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forges had been setup right here, but artisans were already starting to
 break down from exhaustion.
 Work had been issued to forges and workshops around the Territories, and
 failure to meet the allotted quota assigned to each was punishable with
 death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same went for the grand fields of noble families.
 It was reported that even the Lords themselves, the heads of families,
 were working their own fields, busy to harvest as much grain, wheat and
 fitlle as possible, however premature the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole of the Territories was living and breathing in preparation of
 the army - everything else had come to a standstill.
 Mills had broken down from excessive speed while grinding endlessly.
 Rumours of some of them catching on fire trying to meet the demands could
 not be far from the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Horses and tract animals of all kinds like cows and donkeys were being taken
 forcibly from their masters, inmost cases the only animal they had to work
 the lands or make a living with.
 Huge convoys stretching from one side of a town to the other were being
 created by local procastinator forces, and went about the countryside,
 picking up whatever it was on their ministry approved lists, filling up
 cart after cart of supplies and materials for the army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of that wealth was congregated and amassed in even larger convoys that
 stretched from one end of the horizon to the next, filling up the few roads
 that carts could go traverse.
 Some of them had already started arriving at Pyr and the staging area,
 a huge stretch of land to the south of the City, where once the harbor
 of Urfallim with lay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The harbor was made a new, and ships from the farther reaches of the Territories
 should begin arriving in the next couple of days, like the convoys cart,
 laden to the brim with supplies and men, flirting with disaster from being
 overweight and prone to sinking should they happen upon bad weather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Procastinators around the lands with the authority of the ministers rounded
 up men fit for duty of all ages, those who had received military training
 as militia men in the past, as well as new recruits that could not tell
 the pointed tip of a spear from a moose's behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was happening too fast for comfort, too hastily for anyy serious preparation
 to be made, plans laid out and understood.
 The people under his command, from the high ranked officers, the colonels
 and brigadiers, to the lowly green recruit, would not have enough time
 to prepare, get their bearings, get to know what their purpose would be,
 their orders and responsibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He hoped first that he could put it all together in time, since failing
 to do that would mean his head.
 He though about that, and it did not frighten or trouble him, not in the
 sense it would most people.
 Of course, it would be more than unpleasant, but he had long accepted that
 he would be asked at some point, sooner or later, to give up his life for
 the glory of the Gods and the Castigator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had just never occured to him that such a time would come rather later,
 right before he would be rotated to an easier life of teaching young aspiring
 officers.
 And it definetely had not occured to him that his death might not be because
 of an enemy's spear, sword, rock, arrow or fire, but because of failing
 to meet production quotas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it would more specifically boil down to a lack of chisels.
 The thought brought a bitter smile to his lips, and he sniggered with a
 dark sense of amusement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wished he could have a smoke right now, a nice pipeblend of uwe, keplis
 and dark tobacco, but he had given up on the habit a long time ago, and
 now lacked all the assorted paraphernalia, as well any sort of tobacco
 to speak of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps a one of his officers would be so kind as to volunteer a pouch and
 a pipe.
 If it came to that he would order him to do so.
 He grinned for thinking like a brash cadet once more, and sipped a hearty
 mouthful of uwe from the cup he had confiscated with authority from one
 of the desks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It tasted horribly.
 Some idiot had let the uwe leaves boil along with the water, and the result
 was a horrible green broth fit only for mules and perhaps sailors.
 He threw the cup altogether and headed back to his offices, his head much
 more clearer but his mood equally, if not more glum than before.
 He made a mental note to himself to reprimand the one responsible for the
 terrible uwe tea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he entered the planning chamber which was filled with his officers,
 he noticed it was completely silent and everyone inside firmly standing
 to attention.
 He thought he had given orders that with such hectic work going on, discipline
 should be lax.
 He couldn't have everyone standing stiff as a corpse every waking minute,
 and the shouts of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he gestured them to sit down and go about their work with a simple
 flick of his hand and they did not comply, only then did he notice a figure
 standing in a corner of his office, which happened to turn around and address

 Only his face and sigil implied his person and stature.
 His tone of voice was conversational, unassuming enough but not overly

Tyrledge bowed deeply by reflex, and though at first he was utterly surprised

 he managed a constrained and somewhat witty answer:

 The Castigator walked outside and the general followed behind, careful

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator was keeping his hand tied behind his back, surveying the
 landscape.
 It seemed as if he was enjoying the cold wisps of air sweeping in from
 the south, almost craning his neck in a seeming effort to smell the sea
 breeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a small period of time spent taking in the scenery as if he were a
 visiting tourist, the Castigator spoke, turning to address the general
 face to face.
 His hair was slightly ruffled by the gusts of air that were quite common
 this time of year in Urfalli, and made for good ship-running as well as
 the working of the mills.
 He said to Tyrpledge:

Tell me, General.
 Skip the formalities, and tell me what you really think about all this.
 This campaign.

 my motives for such an operation.
 Who wouldn't want to know what he's going up against, true? Please, Tyrpledge.

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge felt a bit surprised, perhaps even shocked from such a straightforward
 manner.
 It was strange enough when the Archminister came to him and extended somewhat
 of a professional courtesy towards him.
 It was more than strange that the Castigator himself, of all people, would
 be so direct in his approach.
 It probably meant things were about to get all too serious, too suddenly
 for comfort.
 His voice was straight and professional, perhaps a bit sullen when he replied:

 working everyone to near-exhaustion to have as much as possible ready within
 the allotted time.
 If I may say so, the extend of the mobilisation you have requested is simply
 overwhelming.
 There may be a possibility that we will not be ready in time, sire.
 Not completely, not fully.
 I can guarantee a bare minimum of a well-equipped, well-trained and disciplined
 fighting force, but I cannot do the same for the full weight of our armies.
 We are still receiving conscripts and draftees from the villages and towns,
 people that have only worked with shovel, pickaxe and hoe.
 We need more time, sire.
 Or we will not be able to field our maximum numbers.

Two steps beyond
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas woke up feeling refreshed.
 He sat up and flexed his arms and legs, all the time his gaze towards the
 direction of the bullhorn.
 It had been a more than pleasant change to find themselves under the shadow
 of the immense structure that seemed to blot out the sun quite effectively
 for the whole area to have a different feeling all together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, the one thing they noticed almost immediately was the different
 climate.
 Instead of the scorching heat and sticky moisture, they felt they could
 have actually been back in their own world, during a hot summer overcast
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heat was much more sensible, and their sleep had felt much more relaxing
 and refreshing than before.
 The moisture was still a bother, but it was not aggravating as much as
 before.
 And there was no night time to worry about chilly wetness brooing through
 thier bones.
 It was an almost pleasant, comfortable climate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even the vegetation seemed to be somewhat different.
 The trees for one thing, were visibly smaller, and the canopy above them
 evidently thinner, so even though the shadow let less light inside, the
 canopy was thinner and let more of it through.
 So, lighting conditions were about the same, a twilight of sorts that though
 eerie at times, did not put a strain on the eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The greenery was still lush, but it was as if it had shrank a notch, the
 leaves were smaller, thinner, the stems resembled proper plants instead
 of soft green pipes.
 There was less rotting vegetation on the ground, much fewer dropped leaves.
 It almost felt like a weird forest that could have been somewhere on the
 far away lands of the Territories, like the south where they said plants
 like no other grew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas decided not to go for a little exploratory walk as he had done before,
 so as not to alarm Hilderich a second time.
 And in any way now that they were in the bullhorns' shadow, he knew they
 were on the right track, and all they had to do was keep going in the same
 direction.
 It was a matter of time now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would have to worry about what they would actually do only when they
 got there.
 For now, he was more than content to feel a gentle rush of air, quite a
 novelty in contrast to the non-existent wind in the sunlit parts of this
 place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They hadn't found a source of water like the small trickle of water that
 must have been condensed moisture, running through a jumbled mass of thick
 leaves and a particularly shadowy spot somewhere high above in the canopy.

\begin_layout Standard
Instead he thought they could rely on that strange hard-skinned fruit with
 the sweet watery juice inside.
 He could see clusters of the trees at various distances, and a nearby tree
 had even shed some its fruit of its own volition.
 Amonas thought they would probably be most ripe and quite sweet, if trees
 worked like they did back home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word even though only uttered in his mind, brought his thoughts to a
 halt.
 He looked at the ground reflectively, a fleeting sadness visible on his
 face.
 It was not just that he longed to see Celia again, even though they had
 not been apart for more than a week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the worrisome feeling of being unable to protect her that wore him
 down.
 He had told his kinsfolk to keep their distance from her, even if something
 happened to him and he would be unable to be there for her.
 More so, especially if something happened to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As luck had brought things about, he was far away, out of reach, with no
 means to communicate that he still drew breath.
 His people would probably think him dead, or running for his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But with each passing day with no sight or sound of him, no message left
 behind, without some kind of proof, they would silently accept the fact
 that he might not have escaped the clutches of the tyrants.
\end_layout

 to know, and perhaps hope he would still be alive when the uprising began

He was just one man after all.
 He would not hold it against them if they already believed him dead, drowned
 at the bottom of a lake or river, butchered and fed to wild boars or roaming
 dogs.
 They had seen it happen before, they all knew the dangers and the ignominious
 ways the Patriarch and the Castigator chose to dispose of their enemies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he could not bear the thought of lovely Celia thinking him forever lost,
 never to return her trusting gaze, never more to hold her when the nights
 were cold.
 How did she take the news? What did she make of them? Was she drowned in
 sorrow, her spirit broken?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He never thought of her as a fragile thing, a snowflake that melt by touch
 alone.
 She was not a little woman, a hapless gal.
 She never did mind her own business, and she always spoke her mind.
 She was proud of her accomplishments, and knew her strengths and weaknesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was though what he feared most.
 He was one of her few weaknesses, now that he was gone.
 He felt a knot in his stomach, at the thought of her giving up, burying
 him alive with that little ritual they buried their dead kinsfolk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could picture her, dancing to the tune of a weeping song in his memory,
 and then losing herself in the hills and fields, roaming the lands.
 Until her days became unbearable, the thought and memories crushing her
 like a millstone crushes seeds, grinding them to oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, he thought, a sparkle erupting in his heart, his gaze shooting upwards
 through the canopy toward the uncaring, seamless sky.
 She was with child, she would try and burn the world itself before anything
 happened to their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She would come through this, she would endure.
 Even if the thought of his death weighted her down, she would find a way
 to use it as a focus.
 She might even go as far as thinking of avenging him.
 She was a fierce woman, he knew.
 She would be a terrible force to behold indeed, as a mother, and a grieving
 wife.
 He would definetely not want to get in her way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought made him grin with a sense of pride and amazement, as well as
 renewed optimism.
 He tought to himself that since she would be fine, he had no reason not
 to do as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He decided to rouse himself into action, and started off towards the fallen
 hard-skinned fruit he glimpsed earlier, when a sound like a man desperately
 gasping for air mixed with what reminded him of creaking wooden hulls of
 ships, made him pause in his stride and turn around to the source of the
 cacophony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Hilderich and nothing more, awaking with a clatter and a show that
 Amonas had never thought possible, even more so in their current circumstance,
 without even a blanket in hand.
 Still, Hilderich somehow managed to give off the impression of someone
 who had been very violently and quite against his wishes woken during a
 lusciously promising dream after a night of heavy drinking.
 And all that with only soil and fallen leaves under him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas waved a hand and boosted his voice just for good measure before asking:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich yawned with his mouth forming an impossible angle.
 For just a moment Amonas thought his jaws would fall out of place and his
 skin snap in a horrible way, blood and bone spurting forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thankfully that did not come to pass, but he was still mesmerized by the
 way Hilderich's mouth could stretch.
 He still didn't know Hilderich as much as he wanted to, but he knew that
 he was a man indeed full of surprises.
 It's not that he didn't trust him or felt wary of him.
 It was just that he made him go wide-eyed with surprise at the most curious
 of places.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, Amonas picked up a brisk pace and walked off into the distance,
 not needing to hack his way through the much less dense vegetation.
 Hilderich languidly got up, his gaze flicking all around him, looking for
 an inviting bush or hopefully a bunch of fallen branches somewhere nearby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich rested his hands on his waist and surveyed the landscape around
 him.
 He would inevitably have to engage in a wider search than what he could
 merely browse just by standing there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he set off as well into the direction of what looked like a promising
 cluster of older-looking trees, their bark craggy and moss-laden, happily
 whistling a tune he could not possibly remember what it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas seemed to be well-versed in surviving skills and at ease with finding
 his way through this remarkably chaotic mess of a forest.
 Hilderich on the other hand knew his own limitations in orientation, which
 had failed him more than once even in the simple confines of his master's
 keep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he used what he thought was a quite practical way of keeping track of
 his whereabouts: he took off his cloak and cloth shirt and hanging the
 white linen shirt on tall yet thin green stalk, he decided he would stray
 only as far as he could keep an eye on his shirt.
 Unless he went blind or some mysterious lurking thief of the wild came
 along and stole his linen shirt, he felt safe enough to wander away in
 search of some hopefully less than soggy firewood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Amonas came back with his sack filled with various edibles, he was
 surprised to see Hilderich naked from the waist up, sitting next to a few
 piles of wooden branches and bulkier logs sorted by size as far as he could
 tell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was sitting idly, his back propped up against the trunk of a tree,
 legs sprawled nonchalantly.
 He looked expectantly at Amonas sack and said in a casual manner:

 the piles to build a fire.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it was time to move on again, their heart, especially Hilderich's was
 not in it.
 The pleasant environment in combination with their stuffed bellies was
 a major disincentive to even stand up and stretch, much less start hiking
 again in a brisk pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the ground was totally flat, the only variations in height coming
 deceivingly from the various degrees of thickness in vegetation, it was
 still an activity that required some degree of energy and patience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, all their energy seemed to be drained from the need to digest.
 They had indeed enjoyed a small feast: brown ones, some other green horn-like
 fruit with soft sweet flesh, as well as something that resembled wheat
 in taste and form, but was oversized and purple in color.
 And then some other kind of crisp fruit, red flesh in the inside, wonderfully
 juicy and marvellously mellow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Hilderich displaying genuine culinary audacity, mixing various fruitstuffs
 together and roasting them in small leaf parcels, they had indeed made
 the best of what Amonas had come up with, which was surprisingly, and thankfull
y, quite a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas had joked about how sorry he was for having been unable to find the
 pack of boars for which the piles of wood had been amassed.
 Hilderich had insisted that Amonas had been gone for quite some time and
 it was perfectly logical that having nothing much else to do, he would
 have kept picking up more wood if he hadn't felt stiff by the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They thought about it and thought it would be better for them to let their
 stomachs do some work first before they set off, so they talked at length,
 something which in the short time they had known each other, they had not
 found an opportunity for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they lied down around the embers of the fire, hands behind their heads,
 comfortably peering through the canopy of the forest wherever they could,
 invariably seeing not a wisp of cloud, more by habit rather than curiosity
 or expectancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich talked about his curator's apprenticeship and master Olom.
 Amonas shared his memories from a time that seemed remote now, when master
 Olom was a close visiting friend of his father's, when he had not become
 shunned by most Curator's and practically forced to live as a recluse,
 and a hermit, rather than an esteemed member of the Curatoria Prefecta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich had been surprised to know that Olom was in fact a gin connoiseur,
 and Amonas even remembered he had brought a distill of his own as a gift
 once.
 He somehow thought better of the old man now, though saving his life as
 he did seemed to have been reason enough to like him immensely, even right
 before he died.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich asked politely about Celia, having seen Amonas' reading some of
 her letters, but Amonas was somehow reticent.
 He apologised to Hilderich saying that it was not an appropriate time for
 such a discussion, but promised him though that he would be more than happy
 to introduce her to Hilderich when they both got back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, and after a time period of grace that Amonas seemed to be less
 than averse about, and once they both felt they could do so without pain
 and anguish from bellies about to burst open, they started off towards
 what Amonas had declared as the proper direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a while, Amonas was showing signs of uneasiness, stopping every once
 in a while, trying to feel the brush of air.
 He craned his neck, as if the air had a strange scent, something intangible
 but yet evident all around them.
 Hilderich could not smell anything out of the ordinary, or feel something
 out of place.
 He noticed though at some point while they were walking, a tingling sensation,
 some the hair in his back and hands rising as if a chill had settled in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich asked Amonas about it:

No, this is not because of a chilly breeze, Hilderich.

Amonas sighed and resumed walking, his pace not as energetic as before,
 his gaze darting around him, watching for something he felt like he wouldn't
 be able to see until it was too late.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich pulled his cloak tighter in an instinctive motion, as if it could
 protect him, ward him from anything that might be wandering or lurking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, even with their slowed down pace and their almost paranoid wariness
 wearing down their minds, they finally reached the base of the bullhorns.
 They could visibly tell because the vegetation thinned out to small bushes
 and insignificant groves abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the hazy background they could indeed see a wall of sorts engulfing their
 field of vision.
 Once they were past the last few trees and plants, a trench of sorts lay
 there, mossy but clearly man-made, clear-cut lines and angles defining
 it, not deeper than the height of a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And beyond the trench, was where the bullhorns front face dominated the
 horizon, defying the senses in a matter none of them thought possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed gigantic, blocking out the sun with ease.
 To their left and right, all they could see was the wall of the bullhorns
 as far human vision allowed, the horizon visibly incapable of containing
 it., an immaculate black mat wall, its appearance obsidian like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed to be shaped like a huge mount, wider at the base and narrow on
 top, like a solid triangle of sorts, a tetrahedron master Olom would call
 it, Hilderich thought quietly.
 It seemed as if it was painstakingly constructed of small bricks or blocks
 of whatever material it was built from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wall face rose with a small inclination, the blocks forming steps that
 seemed to be possible to climb with some difficulty because of their dimensions.
 The huge horns could be seen further higher and farther away, sitting majestica
lly atop a tall summit that could easily be as high as any mountain of the
 outer Territories.

Now that the walls are safe, what do you think we should do? Any thoughts
 on what this thing is? A monument of some sort? Should we try and walk
 around it, find an opening or an entrance, if there is one? Or should we
 climb up to the summit, to where the bullhorns are?

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas had pretty much laid out their options quite concisely at that point,
 but Hilderich was still skeptical, one hand scratching at his three-day

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Walking around it would take a couple of days, my guess is.
 We'd be searching for something we assume might exist.
 I don't know.
 The other thing is that this wall face is shadowed, but the others can't
 possibly be, not with just one sun, one source of light.
 That means we would be scorched dry with all that sun and nothing much
 in the way of making ourselves a shade.
 So, I have to conclude that the only viable course of action at this point
 is indeed to climb up the summit.
 We could try and search this wall from edge to edge, but I don't know what
 might come of it.
 Quite possibly nothing.
 Whoever built this thing would be indeed quite an eccentric if any door
 would be cryptically lying in an obscure, random position.
 But that's just my guess, and not a very educated one.
 All I have to base my conjectures upon is rudimentary knowledge of common
 practices and some plain old good sense.
 But all that on a different world.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

That's entirely another issue.
 I am convinced that we are in another world because of this damn sun and
 all the trouble I've had the displeasure of enduring in this place.
 But I've seen nothing so far that proves the Gods don't exist and everything
 we've based our society on is a lie.
 There are some lies involved, certainly, but I would be hasty to reach
 such a conclusion of perhaps catastrophic consequences and implications.
 Besides, I'm just a Curator, and only because of chance and the edicts
 of the Curatoria Prefecta.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 intone the name of the society of Curators in which he belonged now, by
 right of his master's untimely death.

Who can foretell? Life's full of surprises, as you already know.

 It seems to be connected to the bullhorns.

And with that last remark, once Hilderich had folded his cloak neatly, Amonas
 began their long, effortful climb up the steps of the bullhorns' base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had started their walk a few towards the bullhorns a few hours ago,
 but the walk was easier than before and less demanding, so even Hilderich
 felt he could go on for a few hours more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The large blocks of jet black though cleanly cut and smoothly finished,
 as if from fine porcelain, offered enough friction for a man unused to
 climbing to be able to push himself upwards.
 Hilderich felt it was somewhat like reaching for the top shelf of a cupboard.
 Child's play then, he thought, only somewhat much more taxing on the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed only after a little more than a hundred steps, Hilderich felt cramps
 and stiffness overtaking his aching body, especially the legs where he
 put much of his strength in to propel himself upwards on the large blocky
 steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas noticed and motioned for Hilderich to take a breath for a while,
 relax his muscles, stretch, and breathe.
 Hilderich's lungs were starting to burn, but he hadn't complained.
 Just as long as they'd made some progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He peered over at the landscape stretching behind them, trying to make out
 where they had originally arrived, where they started their trek from,
 but he was unable.
 It all looked uniformly green and jarring, trees after trees after trees,
 a green sea under a green sun.
 Amonas was standing a few steps above Hilderich, looking thoughtfully at
 the stepd behind them.
 At length, while Hilderich was stretching, feet dangling over the steps
 below, he said with a hint of worry in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know, I counted the steps up so far.
 You seem to be jaded.
 I cannot say I'm not tired either.
 The problem is I've counted one hundred and seventeen steps.
 If you look at the summit does it look any closer to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, Amonas pointed at the summit of the bullhorns, without looking directly
 at them, but rather looking at Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uhm..
 I'm not very sharp-eyed, but I'd say not at all.
 It looks like just as it did when we were at bottom.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes we are.
 I don't know if we should go back down ant forage some more before coming

 We might actually need more than a day to get up there, it seems.

Luckily for you I've kept a brown one and a couple of those horn-shaped

 They should do until then, with a little bit of economy on our part.
 I dread to think I climbing up this monster so I would have to go back

 And after all, if there's nothing important up there, something like that
 pillar of light that brought us here, then we'd be stuck here, wouldn't
 we? We'd have all the time in the world to go searching for new exotic
 fruit then, I woulnd't worry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's tone was ironic, even caustic, but Amonas thought bitterly that
 he was right.
 If their climb did not bring them closer to home, then nothing else would.
 At least not in any foreseeable future.
 He wouldn't have to worry about provisions then.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so they started off to the summit, prepared to only stop for some breathe
 and relaxation, careful not to push their bodies beyond their limits.
 They climbed slowly but steadily, sweat pouring from the pores in their
 skin.
 The higher they went the more they could feel the existence of the wind,
 sometimes a gentle breeze, other times a rough gale.
 The warmth of the air varied, sometimes hot as it was below on the ground,
 other times chill as they had never felt it before here, under this sky
 with its single sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They stopped when they needed to, and moved on when they felt their legs
 and lungs could go on.
 But the higher they wentand the more time passed, it became more and more
 difficult to climb and their pace dropped considerably, their pauses increasing
ly frequent and more prolonged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they had made good progress.
 They could see the bullhorns clearly now, rising as majestically as ever,
 indeed towering over them, dominating the sky above.
 But they had still some way to go before they reached the summit proper,
 and those last few steps seemed to put weights of lead on their legs and
 pour fire in their lungs with every breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed as if they wouldn't make it and actually stop shy of the summit,
 forever perched on a jet black step of the bullhorns.
 But, with grudging determination, and the constant urging of Amonas to
 ignore the pain that made even breathing quite a daunting task, they finally
 reached the last step, and the summit lay all around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panting from the exertion and the toll put on their lungs, they sprawled
 themselves on the surface of the summit which was similar, but not entirely,
 to the blocks of black material they had been climbing on for what must
 have genuinely been hours on end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a few minutes they lay there, doing nothing but squinting at the ever-presen
t sun, and breathing deeply, trying to get their lungs to work normally
 again.
 They felt almost unable to move their legs, and their whole upper body
 was stiff from the tension and the aggravated efforts to reach the top.
 They had succeeded, but that had left them drained and exhausted, staggeringly
 so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was the first of the two to stand up with visible effort and strain,
 and try and walk about the summit, a large terrace from which the horns
 themselves sprouted from on either side, one of them casting a permanent
 shadow on the wide mat black surface.
 He grabbed Hilderich by one shoulder as he still lay down, seemingly ready
 to fall asleep, and roused him to action once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, Hilderich.
 A last bit of effort.
 Let's stand at the shadow over there.
 It's a bit of a walk, but I promise, you can sleep later on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich moaned audibly, expressing both the fatigue that had overtaken
 him as well as his reluctance to even lift his head in protest, much less
 walk someplace in the state he was in.
 But to Amonas' surprise, evident in the furrow of his brow, Hilderich managed
 to pull himself together and stand up, though with pain written all over
 his face, and creaking and crackling noises coming from his joints, bones,
 and muscles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, they reached the base of the shadowed horn, where Hilderich let
 his body almost go limp and fall on the surface, uncaring of its hardness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas sat himself down with less violence, and noticed that Hilderich had
 not hurt himself in any way by his fall, or did not seem to feel any pain.
 At least not greater pain than the one he already was in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas then spoke with a weary, yet friendly voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Finally, we've reached the summit.
 And there's shadow to rest under.
 I'd try and look around for what we can find, but we're both exhausted.
 I think we should rest properly first.
 The place won't go away under our feet right away now, will it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas grin, as well as anything he said at that point was useless.
 Shortly after he finished his sentence, he heard Hilderich snore in his
 usually loud and unworried way.
 He then knew Hilderich must have really overworked himself getting up here.
 He felt Hilderich was warming to himself and by inference to their cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But maybe he just wanted to get back as badly as he did.
 To what was Hilderich coming back though? All he had left was a promise
 to master Olom.
 Find the Stoneforger.
 Did such a person even exist, or was it as so many other things had been
 proven to be, just a myth? He'd have to see for himself to believe it.
 Amonas felt like sleeping as well.
 His body craved it, and his mind told him he could more than use some right
 now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before he laid himself to sleep on the hard surface of the summit, he picked
 Hilderich's cloak, unrolled it and threw it over him.
 He had no intention of nurse-maiding him all the way back home, however
 little or long it would soon prove to take them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he had taken care of Hilderich's meagre comfort, he turned to face
 the other bullhorn, closed his eyes and before even he could think to himself
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this whole world must be huge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, he had fallen soundly asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first one to notice the vibrations was Hilderich.
 He woke up suddenly, as if emerging from a fitful sleep, a nightmare instead
 of a dream.
 He could feel a throbbing sensation coursing through his body, very much
 unlike a headache or some other pain of the senses.
 It was a deeply mechanical sensation, as if the very air was vibrating.
 As he stood upright, senses on the edge waiting for the next sign of impending
 disaster, he could feel his teeth clatter upon each other involuntarily.
 He woke up Amonas immediately by rather indelicately kicking him in the
 ribs where he lay.
 Amonas was sluggish coming around when the whole surface underneath them
 lit up like a miniature sun lay within it, a bright white light underpinning
 their figures.
 The throbbing became a more audible trembling, a deep rumbling feeling
 that seemed to come from way underneath.
 His surprise alerted his reflexes and with a sudden and deft move he was
 on his feet, his head turning in all directions, trying to establish some
 sort of enemy direction to no avail.
 Hilderich spoke hurriedly to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Something's happening.
 This place suddenly came alive.
 We have to do something quickly.
 This might be our chance! I suggest you start looking around.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was still a bit drowsy from his sleep and slow to react, but he eventuall
y nodded in acknowledgement and visibly a little flabbergasted from what
 was going on around him, he asked Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Our chance for what? What are we looking for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Anything! Anything at all is better than nothing! A lever, a button, a piece

 Anything you can find that's not just sleek, or black or both.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich left Amonas standing there trying to picture in his head what
 he would be exactly looking for and walked away towards the center of the
 surface, while at the same time the rumbling grew louder and the light
 stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich though in a frantic state, and not in complete control of his
 thoughts and actions, certainly far from being cool-headed and analytical
 in such moments, still had a knack of noticing things that stood out.
 The blemishes, the one piece that didn't quite fit, the important bits.
 So, after a quick look of the bullhorns themselves, his mind was now working
 in a sort of slowed down time, where every scene in front of his eyes could
 be slowed down almost infinitely, brought to a crawl.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There, in a bubble of time, or a heightened state of mind, he would find
 what seemed important, come up with theories about its existence and role,
 its properties and characteristics, then start eliminating what didn't
 fit or was not as probable, and in the end come up with a solution to a
 problem, or a keen insight that would prove to correct and to the point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then his mind would resume its normal operation so he would be capable of
 speech and most other things considered useful and indeed necessary for
 basic survival.
 It was something that he had caught with the corner of his eye, and had
 pretty much arrived to a conclusion about its significance before he could
 turn around and yell to Amonas:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' reflexes were much better than Hilderich's and he had the clarity
 of mind not to question people when they instructed him to cover himself,
 or avoid something, since they usually did so with the intented purpose
 of saving your skin.
 His body moved almost of its own volition and he let himself fly towards
 the hard surface of the bullhorn's summit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did so, his eyes caught a glimpse of what must have been nothing less
 than fiery death.
 He was barely able to see a giant ball of fire hurtling itself with blinding
 speed towards them, towards this particular bullhorn.
 There was a silvery quality about the fire, and as it came over through
 the bullhorns beyond, he could barely make out Hilderich trying to throw
 himself flat against the bullhorn closes to him in a fashion that would
 seem rather comical in a different situation.
 The flaming apparition was just passing the last bullhorn before Amonas
 instinctively closed his eyes as if that would make it go away, and that
 was the last thing he saw for what appeared to be eternity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He only opened his eyes after the terrible sound of the sky tearing itself
 apart with the force of ten thousand cannons or more had passed, when he
 could breathe once more, when the scorching heat wave above him was come
 and gone again in less than a flash of thunder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought he had gone deaf, since he could hear himself getting up, but
 the sense of sound slowly returned, though his ears ringed like his head
 had been turned into a living bell.
 It hurt like something had ran him over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He checked around to see Hilderich, and found him lying on the black surface,
 trying to move or perhaps stand up but he seemed quite visibly as shaken
 as he was himself.
 But he was alive.
 Whatever that thing was, they were alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had come and gone like a God of thunder, Amonas thought.
 It was strange that he would think in such terms, but he had no alternative
 to express himself by.
 Whatever all that was, it was indeed as they had been nearly smitten by
 a fiery, God of thunder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He offered his hand to Hilderich to help him up to his feet, which Hilderich
 took without second thought, dazed and flabbergasted.
 As he did so, his gaze was fixed towards the direction of the fireball
 that had nearly killed them.
 Hilderich just stood there transfixed, looking out as if waiting for that
 thing to come around and finish them, as if they had been marked for death
 and this was just their executioner calling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked worried and held Hilderich by his arms, trying to attract
 his attention, calling out his name, asking him what was the matter.
 But Hilderich could only afford a mere flick of his gaze, the rest of him
 steadily fixed on the far side of the horizon, accross the row of bullhorns
 from where the flaming thunder had passed over.
 Hilderich then spoke, mesmerized, grave seriousness in his every word:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That thing is the answer.
 We have to ride it, somehow.
 I've never thought anything could go that fast.
 It came and went in two blinks of an eye.
 Can you imagine that? Yet it just passed over our heads.
 Like a tamed star, made to fall forever.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked over the same direction Hilderich was, and then looked bitterly
 back at Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It nearly killed us my friend.
 And you would ride it? You called me a madman before.
 I think it's time I returned that remark.

 use.
 We have to think of other ways.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

There are no other ways.
 There is nothing but wild green lush forest with mushrooms and brown ones,

 It went through and through each of these bullhorns, like a cart on rails.
 Whatever it's headed, it can't be worse than this.

Still, if all that stands to reason, if this was indeed built only to accomodate
 that huge fireball, what makes you think we can ride on it? With it, inside
 it, whatever would make some kind of sense.
 Don't you see how incredibly powerful it is? What are we going to do? Catch
 it with a rope and hang on to it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich grinned and the effect on Amonas was for the first time totally
 disconcerting, perhaps even chillingly terrible.
 He thought the effect of the fiery ball on Hilderich was the loss of his
 wit and mind.
 As these thoughts made a deep frown appear on his face, Hilderich spoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You thing I'm losing it, don't you.
 You think I just went crazy, broke down, my mind left me forever and so

 And I also know that it was designed for that specific purpose.
 Do you want me to explain the reason why or do you think you can come to
 the same conclusion yourself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas shoulders sagged, and he took on an expression of pity, looking at
 Hilderich sorrowfully, as it was the last time he saw him, as if his mind
 had parted with him forever and he was talking to another man entirely.
 Hilderich laughed at Amonas' look:

 What does make sense though is that the signs appealed to almost every
 sense: Sight, hearing, touch.

The corridors of the Disciplinarium were enygmatically silent.
 Lord Ursempyre Remis was escorted by a pair of procastinators, at the behest
 of the Patriarch himself, he had been told.
 The mere thought of that man made him uneasy, and now he had been summoned
 personally.
 His mind raced with conjecture and possible reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As his steps echoed in the stone floor of the hallways that never seemed
 to end, he thought he had a pretty good idea of the Patriarch's intentions.
 He thought that perhaps the Patriarch knew, but he had to know for himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See it in my eyes, Ursempyre thought.
 He would play along his role to whatever end might await him.
 This was a critical point.
 Everything hang in a precarious balance, and this was the push that could
 tip things over either way.
 He calmed himself, emptied his mind and held to just one conviction: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am Lord Ursempyre Remis, Noble Representative, Duke of the Fief of Wir

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That would be the only thought coursing in his mind, and he would make-believe
 if he had to.
 And if things came to that, he had prepared for other contingencies.
 He merely hoped there was time enough, that things would not be rushed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They passed through many hallways, some of them exquisitely decorated with
 hand-woven tapestries of a beautiful, delicate, and quite extravagant nature.
 Others were bleak, strictly functional and indifferent, not destined to
 impress or provoke awe.
 Probably hardly ever seen or used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As if he had not been summoned here officially.
 Indeed, the procastinators seemed eager enough to take him by force if
 he had resisted.
 Would the Patriarch be so rash? Would he suddenly arrest him without good
 reason? Certainly he had the power to do so, but was it to his best interest?
 How could he ever succeed in finding out what drove the Patriarch?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man was a terrifying mystery, an uncanny wildfire people tried to steer
 away from.
 The kind of fire that only consumed, and never warmed or lit.
 He was probably the most dangerous man Ursempyre could hope to face, even
 more dangerous than the Castigator, who might be a tyrant and heartless
 man, a man that cared for naught but power and its exertion over men, but
 he was still a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His motives could be understood, some of his actions anticipated.
 Perhaps he could be reasoned, to the extent that it would seem to him to
 be in his best interests, perhaps offering him a deal he could not refuse.
 But, the Patriarch was a blank, as if totally heedless of the circumstances,
 the dynamics of powerplay and indeed the workings of the world around him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It felt like he had an agenda no one could hope to fathom, an agenda he
 had no intention of altering or suspending.
 He was relentless in whatever pursuit he was involved in, and once you
 laid eyes on him, he looked back.
 It was an eerie feeling, him knowing you were watching.
 It made one think that this man could read your mind with a glance, know
 your fears, your weaknesses, the things that made you cry and the things
 that made you laugh.
 It was as if he was a chilling, unnatural force that coulde bore right
 into your soul and leave you empty, a walking hulk, your mind and soul
 gone, his own at a mere whim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre shuddered at these thoughts visibly.
 One of the procastinators noticed and sniggered scornfully.
 Ursempyre turned to look at what could easily be a common thug in the streets
 of Pyr, and stared at him intently, a hint of suppressed wrath in his gaze.
 The procastinator lost his grin, and stared away, averting his eyes.
 He would remember that face, Lord Remis thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Night had only just fallen outside, and servants could be seen running about
 the Disciplinarium, lighting up braziers and chandeliers where appropriate.
 Halls, corridors, and chambers were being lit up one by one, staff and
 officials grinding on at whatever kind of work that needed to be done during
 these times of war preparations, work that would probably keep them up
 all night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went past the administrative areas, through small warehouses and store
 rooms.
 Lighting was at a premium in these parts of the Disciplinarium, only a
 few torches spread thin, darkness and lighting exchanging places with one
 another at uneven intervals.
 One of the procastinators paused and unhitched a torch from its post to
 carry along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were descending deep down in the lower levels of the Disciplinarium,
 places that Ursempyre had always been loathe to visit, for he was aware
 of the acts usually being performed in these levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kept hidden from prying eyes, this was the place where the enemies of the
 state, the sinners and the ones considered dangerous and unruly were brought
 to be chastised and enlightened.
 His face grimaced at the euphemism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chastisement and enlightenment came at the price of torn fingernails, pryed
 tongues and flogged backs.
 And then there were those who utterly disappeared, the dungeons of the
 Disciplinarium their last murky, cold abode.
 Oh, he knew what was coming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would be thoroughly interrogated by the Patriarch himself.
 The die was cast, it seemed.
 There was nothing more he could.
 He hoped he would be able to escape with his life, but if it came to that,
 he had made arrangements.
 Everything would be put in motion if the hours passed without him emerging.
 It was all planned and primed, ready for what was in the end, only inevitable
 and long ago decided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uprising would begin.
 These thoughts seemed bitter and morose, unbefitting of his determination,
 his purpose.
 He would try and beguile the Patriarch, a task that genuinely seemed desperate,
 but he would.
 And if he failed at that, he would endure as long as he could, until his
 body failed him, until his mind and soul were utterly crushed.
 He had no misgivings, no phantasies of standing against the Patriarch for
 too long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew not what tools of torture he used, but he knew that none had been
 left unbroken.
 Those that he touched, they all gave up in the end.
 They all talked, they all begged for their lives like lesser men, like
 cornered animals, their instincts making a last attempt at salvation.
 But there was no mercy to be had, no humanity in his work.
 If he could not outsmart him, outplay him in a game of his own devising,
 then he would be gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps later rather than sooner, but he would be done for.
 All that mattered was that the uprising would succeed, that it would indeed
 take them by surprise.
 And if he perished during that, it mattered not.
 His memory would live on, his legacy and story told as part of the Liberation
 of the Territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They would be free, again.
 Free to live their own lives as they saw fit.
 Damn the Patriarch and the Castigator and all their cronies, henchmen and
 little thugs, and devils, the men that willingly gave up their souls in
 exchange for a whip, or a quill or a sword.
 Damn them all, they would be free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having lost himself in thought, he hadn't been aware they had descended
 so very deep.
 Instead of stone masonry and man-made walls, they were now walking amidst
 tunnels, wide enough for two men to walk in, dug in the rock and granite
 of the Disciplinarium hill.
 These were old, older than the Disciplinarium, carved in a time lost from
 memory, that no annal had recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he was privy to most of the workings of the Disciplinarium, he had
 not known the dungeons extended to such a depth.
 He was surprised.
 He felt wary of what other surprises lay in stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon they reached a grated gate, sentry guards posted in both sides of the
 gate.
 Where the far side lay, there was little or no light from torches or any
 other kind of lighting.
 No candles either.
 Simply darkness, eerie and silent, like ink blotting the senses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the procastinators nodded to the sentries to leave their posts.
 They would be taking over.
 The sentries looked at each other and knowingly and without protest, question
 or remark, opened the gate, handed their heavy cast iron keys to the procastina
tors and quietly and without further ado left in an organized fashion, forming
 a single file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them looked back and cast a passing gaze at Ursempyre, an expression
 of surprised recognition formed in his face and then it was gone, replaced
 by a fearful, stung furrow.
 Even the guards around this place realised the importance of what would
 follow.
 The Noble Representative would be tortured, questioned, and killed by the
 Patriarch himself.
 An ill omen, but who would challenge the will of the Law and the Patriarch,
 Reverent and Beloved of the Gods, the Holy Avatar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the men that had led him into the caves, spoke with a restrained
 voice, somewhat confused about whether he should refer to Ursempyre as
 a Lord or as just another lost soul, knowing he was at the non-existing
 mercy of the Patriarch.
 He chose the later, fearful of the walls having ears:

-Hilderich is the random apprentice.
 He is the unknwoing target of the Patriarch because he carries tha Master
 Keystone with which entry can be gained into the SToneforger which is the
 game's center, where the current status of the game can be learned.
 The Pilgrim is the decedant of the enemy player of the Patriarch, and his
 people are the last remnants of the enemy that he has to eradicate.
 Each Pilgrimage is a desperate way to keep the game going for the losing
 side.
 Each Pilgrim has to get to the Widelands which was a huge battleground
 where the game was initially lost for the Pilgrim's playing side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
-Amonas has been brainwashed by the Patriarch.
 When Amonas first stumbled upon the teleporter, he was in fact teleported
 to the inner shell, just as when he teleported with Hilderich.
 When he was brainwashed he was led to believe he saw the truth behind the
 Council, the Castigator and the Patriarch and he was implanted with the
 mission of seeking out Hilderich and bringing to the teleporter in order
 to get to the bullhorns.
 The bullhorns and the mass driver train are the only way into the Necropolis.
 In essence, the PAtriarch needs Hilderich's Master Keystone in order to
 open the Necropolis.
 He has to get someone into the NEcropolis and his best bet is his Pawn
 , Amonas, and Hilderich.
 Once they open the Necropolis, he will be able to march into the Widelands
 under the cover of the army, capture them again and take their knowledge,
 find out why he has not won the game yet, and learn of the existence and
 wherabouts of the last pawns of his enemy, the people of the Pilgrim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
-The Patriarch has been creating more and more oppresive ways to create
 a rebellion in order to draw out what he believes must be the last remnants
 of his enemy.
 He has done so before, each rebellion failing, and the game still hasn't
 ended.
 He is fed up and wants to cheat indirectly.
 That is why he uses Amonas, who was a member of the resitence who stumbled
 upon the teleporter in the first place.
 The Patriarch as the player's avatar has knowledge of the teleporters and
 the mass driver train and such, but he cannot actively use them as that
 would be in violation of the rules and he would be disqualified.
 The mass driver train is in fact a network of such trains that serves as
 the mechanism behind the support of the two shells, it is what makes the
 structure of the shellworld viable.
 The key is to gain indirect access to the game's center, the Stoneforger,
 which is located in the Necropolis.

Ursempyre's steps were measured and slow, but steady and unwavering.
 He steeled himself for the confrontation, muscles tensing and relaxing
 in quick succession.
 He was as ready as he could be, he thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cave seemed to be hollowed out artificially, swaths of incandescent
 light pouring out from the large orifice he was instructed the Patriarch
 was awaiting his presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he entered the chamber, the intense light made him squint reflexively,
 but his eyes adjusted.
 It seemed as if light was pouring out of some strange, tall, glass columns
 that seemed to extend beyond the floot and the ceiling of the chamber,
 as if actually grown out of the rock itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre's interest was at once piqued by what he was seeing all around
 him: Four large glass columns like huge rods brimming with light, seemingly
 supporting the tall, wide rocky chamber.
 The Patriarch was standing with his back turned to Ursempyre right amid
 the four columns, his bald scalp glistening under the blueish-white light
 of the columns, gossamer shadows of hisself cast in the shape of a cross
 across the rough, uneven, rocky floor.
 Small wet brown lime stone intentations and juttings with tiny spots of
 shadow dotted the ground.
 A faint humming noise echoed faintly throughout the chamber, which was
 otherwise dead silent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre was drawn into the scenery, taken by surprise, but not overwhelmed.
 He felt curious.
 So much more as to what the intentions of the Primarch were.
 He had been expecting a torture chamber with a multitude of tools and instrumen
ts.
 Instead, he was being shown something very few people, if ever, became
 privy to.
 Perhaps the folk tales about the Ancients and the Curator's ramblings were
 not all for nought.
 But then again, what reason did the Patriarch have to reveal such a place
 to him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thoughts were interrupted by the sly, surreptitious voice of the Patriarch,
 which broke the silence of the chamber, sounding as if it resonating with

Ursempyre frowned quizically at the Patriarch's words.
 He could neither understand exactly what he was telling him, or more importantl

 As always, scripture in High Helican decorated its hem discreetly.
 He didn't look resplendent or intimidating.
 The Patriarch turned to face Ursempyre, hands neatly hidden inside the
 folds of his robes, simple and utilitarian yet finely crafted from quality
 cloth.
 It was as if he sounded sincere for the first time when he spoke again:

Ursempyre's voice had deep, grave undertones etched in it.
 He meant to come across as serious and truthful, yet unfazed, not just

It was supremely decorated with fine leather and silky surfaces, girdles

 In concert, an even more ornate and large chair with a large backside,
 plush with red velvet and a green granite girder appeared behind the Patriarch,
 with a similarly decorated desk, its surface a hard green-veined black
 marble.

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed preposterous, but it looked like as if even more extravagant events

Ursempyre thought he had been exposed, and all the niceties had now evaporated.
 He steeled himself mentally, closing his eyes and thinking of happier,
 earlier times.
 His muscles relaxed.
 He was waiting for a hammering blow.
 Nothing happened any time soon.
 The Patriarch drew the his chair, and sagged on it, as if exhausted from
 copious effort.
 He flexed his hands and crossed his palms, knuckles pointing upward, almost
 as if in prayer.
 At length, he sighed, and then spoke in a raspy, tired voice, more suited

He was acting out of character, for one thing.
 It was as if he was trying to make some point, but had not done so ever

The Patriarch reached out for a small goblet of wine, its contents sloshing
 as if it had just been poured.
 In fact, it had just appeared on his desk.
 He sipped some wine, all the while Lord Remis quieted down, his laughter
 made still by the Patriarch's lack of an answer, physical or verbal.
 At length, after seeming to savour the wine properly, like a man who found
 meaning in the tasteful little joys of life, like a good wine, he said

 them, magnifying the effect:

The Patriarch had risen from his seat, hands behind his back, and was very
 slowly pacing around the columns, his form every once in a while disappearing
 behind a blaze of blue and white light, each time a sliver of his figure

 if it had the ability to see behind the facade of the Patriarch.
 Ursempyre felt suddenly naked, as he had been bared against his will, but

The Patriarch paused and put a hand to his chin, stroking his beard lightly,
 a finger to his lips, as if he was searching for his next words, engrossed
 in thought, careful of what exactly to say.
 Ursempyre was transfixed, at a loss for words.
 He thought he shouldn't be doing this, he shouldn't be even listening to
 this devil.
 His heart told him to try and rip this human terror apart, for everyone's
 sake.
 His mind told him to stay his wrath, and listen.
 He was being told things he would never know otherwise.

Ursempyre tried to take in the Patriarch's words, but he felt unable to.
 It was an overwhelming thought.
 There were so many questions and possibilities going through his mind.
 Would he actually consider such a proposal? Did have any merit? Would the
 Patriarch keep true to his word? Was the Castigator really that powerless
 against the Patriarch? Then, what chance would he stand against Patriarch
 once he felt like he had served his purpose? If he was so powerful, why
 did he need him? Why not crush the rebellion alltogether? Why did he need
 him? What were his limitations? An bloodless uprising, but to what a future
 would it lead? This rotten system would not go away.
 The Patriarch, and the Council, and all the tyranny would still be around.

I think you've misunderstood my intentions.
 This is not a political bargain.
 Indeed any bargain of sorts.
 It is merely a possibility I am willing to entertain, because it suits
 me.
 Perhaps I haven't been too clear, and at the same time I have misjudged
 your intelligence and powers of reasoning and extrapolation.
 I am not sharing power, or recognising my decisions and rule as 'mistakes'.
 You will not be handed real authority, and yes the people will continue
 to be oppressed as you put it, until I deem otherwise.
 You have no real lever against me, apart from certain time constraints
 that I must keep in mind.
 In other words, I am offering you a much more civilised way out, because
 I haven't got the time to grind your puny rebellious followers into oblivion.
 Is that much understood now? Am I coming across? Can you reestablish the
 true position you are in now? Can you fathom that in my greater scheme
 of things you and your 'people' are a nuisance I want to deal with efficiently
 and move on? Or are you that infatuated with your pet idea of a free world
 that you have been completely cut off from reality? Perhaps you might think
 that can all act in everyway you feel like, that chaos can somehow lead
 to wonder.
 That it all sorts itself out in the end, doesn't it? How preposterous a
 notion! I can only find it natural to nurture such gross misconceptions
 since you are little more than infants, barely able to stand on their own
 two feet.
 How could you possible know the truth of the cosmos? You still think of
 the stars as prickles of light, some of them falling down as they die.
 You would know real fear and awe when you saw the death of a star, I can
 assure you of that.
 But you still would not believe me.

 I might also be giving away details and information you would never even

 He had to make a leap of faith, and trust in himself like never before.
 Still, he knew he was walking in a territory far more dangerous than he
 could have imagined from beforehand.
 The Castigator, another pawn.
 These weird abilities of the Patriarch.
 Like the stories of Old, before the Pantheon.
 Folk tales they had seemed, but now they were inescapably real, made manifest
 before his eyes.
 He did not know their true nature, and was loathe to find out.
 Still, why was he being offered this now? Should he not refuse? What made
 the Patriarch so certain of his superiority? What was te true extent of
 his power? Why had he not crushed them at their inception, while they were
 still a handful, weak, their organisation still a dream, a footnote of
 history and legend brought back from oblivion, nothing but a speck against
 the power the Council held all over all? He had to find out before he plunged

 Even the earth and the water, so indispensable to life itself, has become
 a commodity, something to be sold and acquired, according to your sick
 whims and desires.
 Even though that has held true for generations, we are willing to give
 our lives to stop this.
 And believe me we will, unquestioningly, unflinchingly.
 How will you break that resolve, I ask you? Since you are the one that
 has caused this, its your Law and your rule that has brought things too
 far.
 What good will the vanishing tricks do? Will you just vanish when the crowds
 of free men will be running after you? Demanding nothing less than your
 head? Or will you put on another light show like the one around me, hiping
 that the people you consider animals will be dazed, so sublimed that they'll

 As for your other question, I believe that you should be careful not to

 This is not a show I put on for you specifically, Lord Remis.
 It is merely an extension of courtesy, in good faith.
 I simply meant to cast off my mask, to create an honest, conversational

 I simply showed you that I am not the man you might have thought I was,

The Patriarch took a step back, and extended his arms.
 He took on a solemn expression, as if praying or concentrating deeply.
 A strange smell assaulted Ursempyre's nostrils.
 It seemed to emanate from the Patriarch, as far as Ursempyre could tell.
 A smell that reminded him of metal against metal, the smell of blacksmith's
 shop but he all he could see was that the Patriarch was now a bit taller
 than before.
 No, he thought, he is not taller.
 Something's wrong here, his mind voiced with concern.
 He noticed tha Patriarch's feet were no longer touching the ground.
 Then, faint bluish crackles of light like tiny lightning's and sparks of
 light coursed through the Patriarch, his bald scalp having taken on an
 eerie sheen, as if it was suddenly a shiny metal mirror.
 The Patriarch grinned and uttered in High Helican:

With that, the Patriarch tensed and a bright shiny aura began to emanate
 from him, as if turned on suddenly.
 Then his robes were drawn in, tightened around his body as if instantly
 shrunk.
 They visibly outlightened his figure, and Ursempyre was surprised once
 more to see that such a body did not belong to an old man.
 It was an immaculate body, perfectly carved as if it was a statue, a penultimat
e monument to the human body, its musculature detailed beyond any artisan's
 capabilities and talent.
 It was the body a demi-God, exuding awe by sight alone.
 Tha Patriarch's face began to twist and reshape itself as if it was made
 of water or mercury, all the facial characteristics turning into a pool
 engulfed in bright light as fire was about to scorch it.
 And all the while he could see the grin of the Patriarch, even though his
 face was no longer there.
 His mind reeled from the sight before him.
 It was true then, this was a monster beyond comparison.
 the stories and legends were true.
 And the Day of Redemption had happened.
 And it was him.
 It was him all along.
 Even before, all those years past.
 It had always been him.
 The realisation left him wide-eyed struggling for breath.
 The robes around the Patriarch were absorbed into his flesh, which was
 now a rippling pool of molten metal, incandescent with a fiery aura around
 it, levitating a few feet above the ground, resplendant and regal in its
 unique and terrible form.
 At length, this figure spoke at him, with no visible source for the voice:

 Why couldn't this be a mere show, he thought.

He knew.
 When he saw him change into that thing, he saw.
 He felt its corruption overwhelm him, its malevolence flow around him,

 He didn't know how exactly, but it was true.
 He could wipe them out if he needed too, if he wanted to.
 he did not believe that thing could be hurt, not in any real sense.
 He did not know whether the Patriarch himself was still vulnerable, but
 he now believed this was his true form, and the old man a mere charade
 he found more practical.
 Or perhaps it was another one of his whims.
 It didn't matter, this was inescapable.
 He had no options now.
 All he had been planning was for naught.
 He would play along.
 But he would not give up.
 No, he knew they were at a disadvantage, but that was now a blessing.
 Had they went on with their plan, they would have been culled like sheep.
 It was almost as if he was trying to give them a warning, a second chance.
 He would capitulate he would accept, but only for now.
 Only until he knew what was going on this world of his, what was the truth
 behind all this, who was this being that had ruled over them for untold
 years with iron and steel, and whip and truncheon? He'd do what he could,
 and perhaps find a way to bring him down.
 The others, though, who had not seen what he had seen, would they believe
 him? Or would they just curse him as the traitor he would seem to have
 become? He could do little about that.
 he only hoped they'd forgive him before his end.
 That somehow this would workout.

 That is only when every once in a while the wind blew off the stench coming

One of the two soldiers turned around and with a passing look of small surprise
 offered the pipe to the tall man, inspite of him sounding provocatively
 belittling.
 The other man remained indifferent, his head seemed to follow a flock of
 seabirds in the distance, swooping over the sea, probably hunting fish,
 or perhaps idling away their time, just as they were.
 The tall man was now standing with one foot on a stack of sacks.
 He took the proferred pipe and took a quaff of smoke, savoured it before
 exhaling slowly, and then spoke to the two soldiers:

Dekar Pirru shook his head, grinning at the same time.
 Mott was now stirring his broth with a thick wooden stick that just seemed
 to be lying around handily.
 Lanris was putting some fresh uwe in his pipe.
 Twilight was upon them, the smoke from their kettle barely visible now.
 Dekar Pirru seemed suddenly engrossed with thought, his gaze stuck on the
 boiling kettle, eyes seemingly out of focus.
 Lanris took notice, waved his hand to check if indeed the dekar was in
 touch with his surroundings, and found out that was not the case.
 He said with a taste of lack of conviction:

The dekar was standing upright again, arms folded, his sword sheath dangling
 about his belt, his expression a bit sour.
 Lanris on the other hand seemed quite relaxed, resting on the sacks nonchalantl

 He took a draught of smoke from his pipe, before answering his dekar without
 turning to look at him:

Not my place to tell, dekar.

\begin_layout Standard
Lanris intoned his last word with a certain character and an outlandish
 accent that made everyone laugh, especially Mott whose sullen mood was
 eased, and was now up on his feet, stirring his stew with a certain air
 of culinary dexterity.
 Around them, more campfires could be seen, soldiers like them who were
 about to cook something of their own, usually broths of wheat or barley
 which were the main staple food the army provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were about to relax from the exercises of the day, as well as their
 other various duties.
 Some would eat something quick before heading off for sentry and patrol
 duty, and some would rest their aching muscles, have a pipe and something
 to fill their bellies, and sleep heavily until the next morning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some would have made their own arrangements concerning food, perhaps going
 out of their way to procure some meat, either by hunting, or by making
 certain trades, sometimes of a dubious nature.
 Most of the soldiers that did so, traded wine for meat or eggs.
 Wine and spirits were strongly forbidden, but vinegar was allowed to be
 carried, as it was a proven way of cleaning up wounds as well as used in
 the soldier's personal hygiene.
 At least for those that cared about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some had a knack of mixing some vinegar with wine right before consuming
 it, in case some of the officers or procastinators were making their rounds,
 checking up on morale or discipline in the latter case.
 Some had dubbed it winegar, and the name was in wide use in the army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even the officers partook sometimes, as it was known to them that the morale
 and cohesion of an army was far more important in battle than mere discipline
 and adherence to Law.
 It might be a sin, they knew, but who went through life as immaculate and
 free of sin as they when he was born?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as long as those buffoons, the procastinators, were none the wiser,
 everything worked almost as it should, and the army served its Castigator,
 and the Pantheon, in a most untroubled fashion.
 After all, as some of the older officers used to say, you can't make soldiers
 if you don't break open a few casks first.

Mott announced with some enthusiasm in his voice:

\begin_layout Standard
Mott simply shrugged and went to his backpack to fetch his canteen.
 Lanris did so with languid motions, probably certain that the broth in
 Mott's kettle would not disappear any time soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They each helped themselves to a serving, and sat down on the ground, their
 backs against the sacks.
 They split some leftover breadpie from their midday meal, and each began
 eating from their canteens, Mott clearly more than pleased with the quality
 of his cooking, gulping spoonfuls away with vivid enjoyment.
 Lanris seemed much more reserved in his appreciation, and seemed to just
 be thankful for having something other than the drab, grey gunk the army
 called food to fill his stomach with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pirru was looking idly at them while they were having their supper, and
 at length said:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You know, I heard the Castigator came around to visit the day before yesterday.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lanris paused momentarily and furrowed his brow before continuing to eat
 slowly, more so because he wasn't too fond of Mott's stew rather than because
 he was savouring it.
 Mott on the other hand was scraping the last spoonfuls in his canteen,
 and was quite possibly going to refill it soon.
 Dekar Pirru went on:

I see that didn't get your attention, did it? Nothing short of your discharge

 He asked Pirru while sitting down to enjoy it:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

So, did word get out of what they talked about? Perhaps, his Piousness had

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lanris threw a sideways glance at Mott, before throwing a piece of breadpie
 to his head as well.
 He did not add a verbal insult though, and kept trying to consume the broth
 left in his canteen.
 Pirru grinned at Mott's comment and said with a slight edge of worry in
 his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No, I'm afraid his Holyness has not expressed any sort of deathwish.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lanris left his canteen unfinished, broth and breadpie still mixed inside.
 He placed it near one side of Mott, who surely not let it go to waste once
 his second canteen was emptied.
 Lanris wiped his mouth on his sleeve, and started filling his pipe from
 a pouch he had not opened before.
 He asked Pirru then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Dekar, how come you got by all these news? It's not like you to run around
 staff officers like Himmdal and Rynse do.

Yeah, he went to the 'Cent.
 Probably ripped him off too.
 Like the last time when he asked ten coin for some real Iolathan wine that

 Anyway, yes, I went to the 'Cent.
 'One hundred per cent guaranteed' Tibodot, the little rat.
 But I got my coin's worth now.
 He wasn't selling cow dung this time.
 I asked the Centarch somewhat sideways if all was going as planned, and
 he too said there was some upheaval upstairs.
 Some stuff would be put on hold until further notice.
 That's probably the reason I'm not putting the pair of you on auxiliary

Dekar Pirru and Private Lanris of the 5th, under the command of Cilliarch
 Romentho Isoract were put to the sword today at dawn, right after roll
 call, by a squad of procastinators.
 Expeditious procedures were followed and their files of death were officially
 sealed by both the Procastinator's Office and the Strategium Proper.
 Private Mott of the 5th, was given fifty lashes and almost bled to death
 for, and I quote: 'Not being vigilant enough in the prosecution of vile
 deeds that promoted sin, incurred the wrath of the Gods or were an affront
 to the Pantheon and the Rulinc Council'.
 He was not allowed to return to his duties as an active soldier and as
 such was denied of medical attention.
 He was rotated to the work gangs as per the Cilliarch's instruction.
 Also, Cilliarch Isoract relieved centarch Littmo from his duties and has
 petitioned that he be discharged dishonourably.
 The winegar in question seems to have been stolen from the centarch's personal
 cabinet, from what the procastinators' investigation revealed.

 He was rather disenchanted by everything today.

 He took a look in his mirror earlier.
 He supposed he looked kind of glum, morose, even outright sad.
 There wasn't much he could about it, he thought.

Tyrpledge sighed more audibly this time, thinking this day had started off

 Though the term 'usual' was rapidly evolving from day to day, this was

 Major Guighan had just given him the latest situational report.

 Tyrpledge had been notified that the army was now officially mobilised
 and legally at war.
 Of course, he thought, there were no specific orders included, other than
 that he should await for further notification at a later time.
 In essence, they were leaving him and his men to roast on hot coals until
 it suited their purpose.
 Such was the fate of soldiers, he mused bitterly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, those orders had cost those men from the 5th their lives.
 As it is, they were at war even though they didn't know with who, and that
 meant that by Law, the procastinators dispersed among them had more authority
 than he did in matters of discipline, persecution of sinners and the relevant
 penalties that might apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed that in wartime, theft and consumption of spirits and other substances
 that 'occluded the mind' were punishable by death.
 Tyrpledge was thinking that the centarch whose life was destroyed was lucky
 compared to his men.
 He then spared a few moments thinking about the soldier who was found asleep,
 next to the ones that had been drinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had given him fifty lashes because he wasn't vigilant enough.
 And then they had left him without even a towel to soak up his blood.
 Tyrpledge's thoughts on the matter was that it would be a miracle if he
 made it out alive.
 But that's what war is about.

, he voiced his final thoughts in a low voice, almost a whisper, and sat
 upright in his chair, hands outstretched, his gaze focused outside beyond
 his window, where he could see the majority of his battalions forming up.
 He could discern a sullen mood.
 It was not that the pace of the men milling about was slow.
 They were preparing their equipment fastidiously, checking their armor
 and their packs so as to make sure everything was in order.
 They had that unmistakable air of professionalism about them.
 But they seemed to be lacking the blaze in their eyes.
 The glimmer in their eyes, the red flush cheeks that let you know their
 blood was boiling, their hearts pumping with excitement.
 There were no such signs here.
 No nervous humor from his staff members, no rauncy jokes from the enlisted
 men.
 At least he could see any of them laughing.
 Every face he could make out from that distance, was stern, frigid, cold.
 This, he thought, should not be the faces of men going to war, knowing
 they might be dead before the night falls, wishing their death would be
 worthwhile, remembered, even praised.
 This was the face of men knowing they might be dead and wishing they were
 someplace else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The execution of the men from the 5th had taken quite a toll on overall
 morale.
 They might be much more cowed now, but that's not what he needed to wage
 war.
 He needed hot-bloodied men with vices and things to wish for.
 Not little meek children fearful of the reprisals of the Law.
 Why didn't the procastinators understand that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the briefest moment he thought about contacting the Procastinator Militant,
 asking for his assistance, perhaps telling him even to go as far as relaxing
 their vigilance, bending but not strictly breaking the Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He immediately thought better of it, since he reminded himself that Gomermont
 was above all, first and foremost an idiot.
 And telling an idiot who has spent a considerable amount of time and effort
 to become leader of a pack of idiots to smarten up a bit suddenly, was
 if not a one-way ticket to the gallows, a certain way to scream in despair
 and agony at the mind-numbing foolishness the Procastinator Militant exuded
 with his every utterance.
 In essence, it would be a lost cause.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a time for war and a time for peace, security, stability, lawfullness.
 War was lawlessness in itself, a grandiose lawless fair where people died
 horribly and for reasons beyond their understanding, where nothing mattered
 more than victory.

His bleak thoughts were accented by the lack of a good cup of uwe.
 He decided he wanted a nice distraction, something to take his mind of
 a situation he now felt powerless to amend.
 He would just have to swim through the wave of the coming difficulties
 as they arose stoically.
 To do that, he had to have a good cup of uwe, fresh and steamy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He now felt determined to turn his thoughts around, wish for the best, keep
 his hopes up.
 The uwe would be critical in that respect.
 He went for his bell in order to let his aide-de-camps know he wanted some
 uwe urgently, but before he could do that, as if by a miracle or a mind-reading
 ability that the major had not exhibited so far, he entered through the
 door in a hurried fashion, stood to one side, saluted briskly and clicked
 the heels of his boots, his sword smartly tucked away with his free hand.

Before Tyrpledge could utter a single word, the Castigator of the Outer
 Territories walked in the general's office, resplendent in his wargear,
 a match for what he was wearing on the anniversary of the Pacification

 of the suns.

The major tried announced the Castigator, but he was cut short by a wave

 The Castigator was dressed for wartime, that much was certain.

 who was still sitting down in his chair, too flabbergasted to remember

Celia gave her hand like Ikebod asked her, ans he led her through a small
 corridor into the waiting room, which was in essence, a large guest hall,
 lavishly adorned with paintings, complete with what appeared to be well-lacquer
ed hand made quality furniture of very fine and delicate taste.
 There were even crystal chandeliers full of lit candles, brightly illuminating
 every corner of the more than adequately large chamber, fit for a grand
 banquet rather than a mere waiting room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paintings seemed to be portraits of the ancestral Lord of House Remis,
 numerous indeed.
 Celia had no intimate knowledge of the House's history and tradition, but
 it seemed like they were truly an old, venerable family of illustrious
 heritage.
 She took a closer look of some of the portraits, and the plaques on each
 one confirmed her thoughts: Some had been Generals of the Army, some Noble
 Representatives just like Lord Ursempyre.
 But she took more notice of the ones who seemed not to have taken a liking
 in politics or the army.
 Their portraits were mostly family portraits, including all the close members
 of the family: their children and wife, as well as their grandchildren
 where applicable.
 Some portraits were quite large, others much smaller, rather unglorified.
 Most depicted smiling, warm, inviting faces.
 House Remis seemed to be bred and raised as good-hearted, wholesome people.
 It seemed only natural to her now that one of them would choose to side
 himself with what many would consider dangerous, traitorous, spiteful,
 blasphemous people.
 The thought that any man would consider people like Amonas as such, depicting
 them as worse then murderous scum, made her giggle despite herself.
 Her thoughts went briefly to Amonas.
 She stopped giggling then, but did not feel despair and sulleness like
 before.
 She simply felt a keen longing for her love.
 That made her touch her swollen belly reflexively, as if to share her thoughts
 with her unborn child.
 Ikebod noticed the gesture and spoke to her, his genuine concern evident
 in both his eyes and his voice:

She sat down on a wide couch with red velvet lining and only one arm.
 It must have been purposefully designed as such, for people to relax comfortabl
y in a lying position.
 With slow, careful movements she laid herself down, her head relaxing on
 a plush soft pillo propped against the couch's single arm.
 She felt her back throbbing slightly, faint echoes of pain coursing from
 her feet up to her neck.
 She was tired, she had to admit to herself.
 The tension and the urgency, the walk here, all that had been too much
 for her in her situation.
 She thought for a minute how she could hope to outrun any possible pursuers.
 She hoped she'd give birth before such a necessity arose, and if that was
 not the case, she hoped she'd find the strength to do so.
 Her gaze wondered around the luxurious but not pompous chamber.
 Small objects of art were to be found on most furniture, like the grand
 table and some fine cabinets.
 She thought the decoration was very appropriate and measured, to her surprise.
 She had thought rooms like these were designed to impress with their ornate
 luxury, flaunt the owner's riches and resources.
 But this was not the case.
 It was an elegant space, that very much invited pleasant, quiet, reflection
 and sincere conversation.
 A place to spend quality time, she thought.
 As she closed her eyes, eagerly welcoming the onset of a much wanted sleep,
 her gaze was locked on plain but beautifully crafted vase of pure crystal,
 the shimmer of the candle light forming tiny little multihued rainboes
 on the crystal's numerous faces.
 It reminded her of summers' gone past, she and her father alone by the
 like, him teaching her about the water, the sky and the light.
 She could only remember him fishing quietly, almost reverently, with neverendin
g patience and almost complete devotion.
 With that warm memory, she fell asleep on the couch, clutching her abdomen
 because of an instinct none could hope to suppress.

 She had made every effort not to let them, but in vain.
 They had their way and left there where she lay, a damp place that smelled

 They'd left her there to die, right by her baby.

 His delay could mean a lot of things, most of which I dare not think about
 from consternation.
 In any case he would not want a guest of his to starve to death, especially
 a lady carrying.

 Celia on the other hand sat upright with a jolt, her eyes went wide and

Dear lady Celia, I know all that, and still I would ask of you to have something

 For your child's sake.
 Do not think of me as a cynic, or a bland acquiescent servant.
 I dearly love Master Ursempyre, for I have almost raised him as my own
 ever since his parents passed away when he was still just a little boy.
 When he left the estate, he gave me specific orders in the event of his
 disappearance.
 I too believe in the kinsfolk and the purpose that drives them.
 I would be betraying my master if I wavered, if I gave up without a fight,
 if I thought him dead and gone so easily.
 But even without him, lady Celia, life must go on.
 We must try our hardest to have freedom for all, for once.
 If anything should happen to him, I will grieve like a father who's lost
 his only child.
 But I've learned there's a time for grieving, and a time for hoping, a
 time for fighting.
 And so I shall hope, and fight, until I have reason to do nothing else
 but grieve.
 Do you understand that, my lady? I hope you do.
 Please now, come and have something to eat, if not for your sake, for your
 child's.

Celia looked in the old servant's eyes with compassion and a sudden care
 she had not felt until now.
 He was opening up his heart and soul to her, exhibiting trust she had thought
 rarely found.
 She thought she understood.
 In a manner, that was how she felt for Amonas, who though was nowhere to
 be found, and had not seen or heard from him for days now, she still knew
 he was alive.
 Against reason, she knew he was alive, somewhere.
 And she'd better give up her life before she gave up hope.
 Because, she thought, even if Amonas would never return, their child would
 be born.
 And she would have to do her best to deliver her child in a new, free world.

 I've prepared some fawn soup with some beaten egg and lemon, a variety
 of sweetmeats, smoked ham and roast potatoes with butter, some lamb stew
 with uwe and some nivoa fish with a beetroot purée.
 The salad is a mix of cabbage, lettuce, and radishes, dressed with oli
 and goat's cheese.
 For desert, I've prepared some cherry pie and the master's favorite, nutmeg
 and chestnut maffle.
 I apologise for the lack of salad variety, but I was in a hurry.

Well, I haven't heard of purée before, but I'm sure it's something nice.
 Though I'd be interested to see what you would have prepared if you weren't
 in a hurry, sir Ikebod.
 Please, do not lay out all that.
 I think I'll have the soup and perhaps try the dessert as well.

Celia nodded her thanks and smiled.
 She felt very lucky to be treated so warmly by, in essence, complete strangers.
 She was almost feeling guilty of overindulging herself, but she withheld
 her thoughts, since she knew they'd only serve to insult Ikebod's hospitality
 and hurt his feelings.

They went up the stairs and they were greeted by a large dining-hall, dark
 green and grey marble columns supporting the high ceiling.
 Exquisitely ornamented chandeliers adorned the roof and cast bright let
 across every corner.
 The dinner table was made from a fine solid piece of wood that seemed old
 and venerable, but judging by its healthy sheen, was thoroughly maintained.
 It was probably hundred of years old and from its size, Celia thought it
 could seat upwards of three dozen people, perhaps even four.
 She noticed there were no plates of food or dishes of any kind set and
 she was slightly puzzled.
 She asked Ikebod then:

Oh, most are asleep by now my lady.
 The maids tended to your room, and it's ready for you.
 I suggest you lie down there right after your dinner.
 Some of the other servants and the guards have certain duties to attend
 to in other parts of the estate, mainly the stables from what I can gather.
 House Remis is not always this silent, perhaps in the morning you will
 see for yourself.

Celia inquired no further and soon they entered the kitchen itself.
 Dimly lit by a few candles, it was full of utensils and large wooden surfaces
 for chopping meat and foodstuffs.
 She could see there were more than one stoves and at least large ovens.
 Large empty bowls, cauldrons and kettles were gathered in one corner.
 Though quite large for a kitchen, Celia felt the place was cramped and
 imagined it would be close to asphyxiating when people were working here
 in full swing.
 Ikebod pulled a chair for her and gestured for her to sit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She thanked him with a smile, and sat down to a quite normal table that
 seemed to have seen its fair share of use.
 It was indeed laid out with a simple linen, the bowl of soup in the middle,
 a glass and a wooden jug of wine side by side.
 Her plate was already filled with steaming soup, which gave off a light
 aroma.
 Indeed, the kitchen smelled of a lot of things, and the odours seemed to
 fight each other fervently but to no avail.
 The combination was pleasant, thick, as if one could fill his stomach simply
 by breathing this air.
 The soup had a distinctive smell of egg and lemon.
 Light, but inviting to the taste.
 She reached for a piece of bread, while Ikebod had already sat down opposite
 her, sipping on some wine from a simple cup.
 She realised the smells exacerbated her hunger and she started to sip her
 soup eagerly.
 Ikebod spoke:

I hope I'm not being too friendly.
 I supposed my company would not offend you.
 And since I could not leave you all by yourself in a strange kitchen, I
 thought I'd sit down for a change.
 It's been a long day.
 Perhaps the night will be longer.
 My feet ache.
 They tend to do that at my age.

Ikebod was grinning, though there was some hint of pain and weariness in
 his voice.
 Celia gupled down a hearty spoonful, even though the soup was still visibly
 hot.
 She paused a bit to reply to Ikebod:

\begin_layout Standard
Celia had a playful smile, her face comfortable and relaxed.
 She felt indeed in the presence of a friend long lost, or more likely,
 long sought after.
 Perhaps Ikebod reminded her of her father.
 She was too young to remember much about him, but she knew he was a good
 father, a good man.
 She was certain Ikebod was such a man as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she finished her plate of soup, she briefly thought about having another
 serving.
 The child must be hungry as well, she thought.
 A brief pause and the smell of something sweet and mellow made her decide
 otherwise: she'd have the dessert instead.
 After all, another serving this late at night wouldn't ease her bad dreams.
 Ikebod, as if he could read minds, had already served her a plate of cherry
 pie and that maffle he had mentioned earlier.
 She attributed Ikebod's forward thinking to his long experience as servant
 to a noble house, very much so the Noble Representative's estate.
 No matter why or how, his timing was perfect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded to her and said:

I'd advise you to start with some maffle, then savour a bit of the cherry
 pie.
 It has a nice sour touch to it.
 Then I'd mix and match at will.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded appreciatively and happily dug in the maffle with a small fork.
 It was very soft and wholesome at the same time, the nutmeg providing a
 very homely taste, simple yet fulfilling.
 Then the cherry pie was indeed sour but that only helped to accent the
 feeling the maffle left at her palate.
 Amidst all the confusion, the sense of loss and danger, the chaos of the
 impending tumult and her running away, she was genuinely happy and thankful
 there was time enough for her to enjoy a morcel reminiscent of happier
 times, as if everything was alright in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her thoughts were disturbed by what seemed to be sounds akin to yelling
 and shouting coming from other parts of the house.
 She could hear there was some uproar, voiices from rooms above conversing
 loudly.
 It was all too sudden.
 Ikebod was already leaving the kitchen.
 He turned to her as he stood at the open door:

Please, stay here.
 I'll come back right away.

 Probably important news.
 I won't be long.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ikebod was at once gone from her sight.
 She returned her gaze to the table.
 The desserts were lying in her plate in front of her, half-eaten and unruly.
 She noticed she had not restrained herself from eating as she pleased,
 but she had rather enjoyed it.
 Which was only natural not to last forever, she thought.
 The dimly lit kitchen which had felt warm and full of wholesome smells,
 now seemed vacant, cold, dark.
 She felt like leaving the room immediately, and did so with some haste.
 She wanted to see and hear the news herself.
 Perhaps there was news about Amonas; her heart skipped a beat at the thought,
 but she brought her mind to its senses.
 That would not cause such an uproar.

 the empty kitchen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She went through the corridor into the dinning-hall.
 She could hear voices from below, and she raced to the stairs leading to
 the waiting-room with wary expectation wrinkling her face.
 When she reached the feet of the stairs below, she could see Ikebod hurriedly
 conversing with three men, two of them clad in metal armor, and one of
 them bearing a dishevelled cloak, with mud and perhaps blood on his face.
 The two men must have been guards and were being issued orders probably,
 nodding emphatically at something Ikebod was explaining.
 The other man was evidently fatigued, perhaps injured, and he seemed exhausted
 from running, breathing heavily, once every so often gulping down some
 water from a tall jug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She just stood there, not knowing if she should interupt them, probably
 fearing she would ask something silly or impertinent.
 She thought that this was no time for being shy, and just called out for
 Ikebod, not harshly, but demanding his attention:

 After a brief pause of silence, Ikebod answered her:

He paused again, this time his face visibly contorted by a strange mix of
 exasperation and sorrow, his eyes torn between shedding tears of anger
 or rueful weeping.
 Celia was transfixed where she stood, her breath coming in shallower with
 every word Ikebod spoke.
 At length he continued:
