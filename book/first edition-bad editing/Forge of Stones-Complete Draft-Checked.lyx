 hunter felt the air thicken.
 He ventured a look towards the gathering storm.
 The wind started to gather into brief furious gusts, fallen golden leaves
 dancing around him.
 Fleets of scurrying animals could be heard, running for refuge, burrowing
 in whatever shelter the forest could provide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His prey seemed indifferent to the coming weather though.
 The tracks were heavy-laden, and steady, even purposeful.
 It wanted to be found.
 It was as if it was challenging him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He crouched low amidst a thick cluster of bush and peered into the ashen
 wall of birch trees, his senses on the edge, everything around him pulsing
 with intensity, his mind focused on his prey.
 He emptied his thoughts, and closed his eyes.
 He reached for the small pendant around his neck, a golden tipped arrow
 felling a silver eagle.
 With a silent prayer to God and a fire burning from within him, he darted
 off into the trees, the shadows they cast over his hooded figure almost
 failing to touch it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His feet carried him on a galloping pace, fast and steady, swiftly cutting
 through the forest, following the clear, fresh tracks.
 The scent he traced was still strange, neither like any animal or man he
 had met or heard of before.
 He paused to sample the soil, feel the ground with his hands.
 He tasted copper and a tingling sensation lingered on his tongue.
 He strung an arrow through his bow and felt exhilarated, brimming with
 a confidence he deserved well.
 The deeper he went into the woods, the stronger the expectation for the
 kill became.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As his breathing became faster so did his pace, his form blending in with
 the forest like a blur.
 His chest and leggings in brown and dark green leathers, with the coppery
 scale mail overlaid made for perfect camouflage in the autumn woods.
 Silent, swift and deadly, he had the advantage.
 He had smeared his exposed flesh with fresh dirt and his bodice was treated
 with boar fat, to preserve the leather and cover up his human scent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stealthy as possible, he followed a small stream that led to the east,
 to the Hollows.
 The tracks started to become faint, the soft dirt heavier and crisper.
 The scent grew mellow, the metal taste in his mouth waned.
 He was losing his prey.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He lay still for a moment and took a westward look, towards the clearing
 from where he entered the forest.
 Above the forest ceiling he could make out the grim blue and black of the
 stormy clouds.
 Lightning flashed the scenery alight, the trees around him casting shadows
 like the fanged mouth of a terrible behemoth, menacing and inescapable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trickle of the stream was drowned under an ominous thunder.
 The first drops of rain fell on his cape.
 He felt he was now losing the advantage.
 The scent of his prey would be washed away, his vision would be of little
 help in the chaos of a storm, the forest would be filled with distant shadows
 and all noise would be lost under the thunder and the falling rain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a hint of sight, sound or smell, his chest caught fire.
 The hunter frantically searched for his foe, but then a second and third
 fiery sting brought him to the ground.
 His face was contorted with a soundless expression of pain and amazement.
 It felt like arrows had pierced his armor but there were no arrow stalks
 or heads.
 It mystified him, that he should die in such a fashion, never once seeing
 what or who took his life.
 The world around him became gray and he felt a rush of pain before his
 senses finally failed him.
 His breathing stopped, and with the forest ceiling occupying his view,
 the hunter exhaled laboriously and silently prayed to God for the last
 time.

 reveled in the darkly lit chambers, her form that of a swirling dervish,
 the locks of her hair mirroring the precious light with an intoxicating
 sheen of honey and brown, ethereal smell of roses and lavender pouring
 out of her skin.
 She moved as if the ground was a mere illusion to be disregarded, her arms
 faintly bent upwards as if praying, or caressing the lithe forms of young
 gods, and her face had the impression of unborn awe, mesmerizing to see,
 inviolate to the touch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She danced to the sounds of incessantly beating drums, in patterns and rhythms
 deep and rumbling that thumped her very soul, following a melody of strings
 as clear as a mountain spring erupting, a fresh dew engulfing the chamber,
 and a band of flutes calling out to unseen spirits, as if a ritual of old
 was being performed for her pleasure alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music reached a crescendo, a ground-shaking climax and she became frenzied
 with passion, exhuming a mystical air of love, a beacon of a haven for
 all the unloved ones, an unseen contract with a muse behind each tempting
 gesture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her faint gossamer dress swirled and failed to contain her ethereal form
 in such a breathtaking way, that even the flames of the brazers around
 the chamber flickered in tune with her dancing form to cast shadows that
 seemed to have a life of their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd around her was silent and still, wearing almost identical masks
 of brass, the few flames that illuminated the chamber adorning them with
 golden hues of honey and a glimmer of sunlight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single man stood at the edge of the dancing stage, robed with heavy linen,
 his face unmasked for everyone to see, tears running down his cheeks, welling
 under his chin in an unwavering steady flow, his face a painful mix of
 sorrow and awe, his eyelids closed shut in a vein attempt to contain his
 tears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the climax of her dance, she laid her body down, planted her feet and
 hands to the stage, her back forming an arc.
 And then she convulsed in a familiar but unspoken way, the way of ecstasy,
 her pelvis moving to the rhythm of the drums, faster and faster, as if
 an invisible lover was being forced upon her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music came abruptly to a stop and utter silence filled the chamber.
 She sagged to her knees, her hair concealing her face completely.
 The silence was deafening, the only sound her ragged breath.
 Then the unmasked man spoke while bowing solemnly:

Celia, I lack the words.

In a transient moment of still time, the crowd of masks said in one voice:

.
 As soon as the word was spoken, the masked men dispersed as if answering
 to a silent summons and melted into the shadows, as if they were never
 really there, as if they had been a mirage, a background for this dance
 alone.
 The dancer and the unmasked man still remained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He extended his arms, palms facing upwards, a gesture to the dancer or mayhap
 the Gods themselves.
 She stood up on her bare feet slowly, her hands touching her thighs over
 her gossamer dress, strands of her hair upon her bare shoulders.
 He spoke more softly, as if not to be overheard, even though there was
 not a living soul around in earshot.

At his words, she touched his palms and drew closer to him.
 She looked upon his face, wet with tears and lit by flickering flames,
 her hazel eyes still glittering with ecstasy, alight with enthusiasm, and
 yet forming a wizened look that belied her years.

man dressed in dark crimson robes and a sky blue sash made haste up the
 keep's long winding staircase.
 Perspiration covered his craggy old leathery face, his gray bearded chin
 still awash with the wine he had spilled only moments earlier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Not now, not here.Damn the fools, damn them!", he kept repeating to the
 deaf, heavy-set stone walls, with almost every breath.
 The flickering flame of the torch he held cast his form in shadows over
 the stones of the stair's steps, on the dank walls.
 The form of a stumbling, muttering old fool.
 Even the shadows seemed to mock him, crouching even lower than him as the
 staircase finally unwound onto the roof of the keep.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Why now, while I still draw breath?", said the old man as he caught his
 breath, and started off to find what it was he came looking for.
 As if long ago forgotten, he fumbled around the roof, while a lukewarm
 dusk gave way to a chilling, gloomy moonless night.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept straightening his beard with one hand, while his eyes were closed,
 and his other hand was raised, a pondering finger waving in a hazy, uncertain
 rhythm.
 As if trying to catch up with a silent tune only he could hear.
 Suddenly, he opened his eyes and set off with his head intently searching
 the floor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The air smelled of liquorice and the burned wheat stalks of nearby farmsteads.
 Planting season.
 He looked annoyed, trying to pick up a loose cobblestone from the roof.
 It gave no purchase, and try as he might he could not so remove it.
 He grumbled a mild curse, unfitting of his Office, status, demeanor, or
 personality.
 But to hell with all that.
 It wouldn't matter soon, none of it would, he thought.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Standing upright, he folded his arms and breathed deeply, his elbows sagging
 slightly, his chin almost touching his chest.
 He sighed, and then abruptly erupted with a flurry of curses, kicks, punches
 and stomps again quite unseemly for a person of his stature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Curator.
 By mutual assent among his peers, not a very prestigious one, but nonetheless,
 a Curator.
 Forcing himself to calm down, he drew a few deep breaths before standing
 over one ledge from the roof and shouting, almost in a screech: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hilderich!!Hilderich!" An answering shout came from somewhere below: "Over
 here master Olom, over here!" The curator leaned over the ledge, searching
 for a face to direct his ire at, to no avail.
 He shouted once more, throwing his fists wildly into the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hilderich, you mongrel! Fetch the keystone from my study, run like there's
 no tomorrow!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the curator and Hilderich complied smartly to the best of his abilities.
 A few moments passed then, and a lot of things happened at once.
 First, a few steps behind where the Curator stood, the air twisted and
 reality gave way to nothingness, where a large kind of slit formed suddenly
 and the world seemed as if made of a paper tapestry badly sewn together.
 The Curator felt a strange rush of stinging air, turned about slowly, and
 had time enough to yell one last time at his pupil:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Run now! Find the one I dared not!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Hilderich ran outside the small keep, his gaze locked with the despairing
 eyes of his master, whose last look implored him silently to live.
 A hooded form seemed to grab Curator Olom from his neck with a single armored
 hand and lift him over the keep's parapet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich stood there for a moment transfixed, overtaken by the speed and
 incredulity of what was taking place.
 When the hooded figure turned its head slowly towards him, fear pierced
 his heart.
 When the Curator fell down to his death, it was still looking at him, only
 now Hilderich was running, eyes wide with horror, hands gripping the keystone
 with white knuckles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hooded figure stood where the curator had been standing only moments
 earlier, the slit behind it now gone, as if it had been a trick of the
 eye.
 With scarcely a thought, it jumped off the keep's roof and landed on its
 two feet, barely registering the 60-foot drop.
 As it turned to run after Hilderich, it paused instinctively after feeling
 the bloodied hand of the dying Curator tugging at his plated boot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Had to make sure first.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the curator through agonizing pain and a broken jaw while clutching
 his pendant, when himself, the keep, and the figure that had appeared out
 of thin air became a thing of the past, bright white light suddenly filling
 the dusky plains accompanied by an eerie, unnatural, unnerving silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich only felt a haze of feat and a tingling at the back of his head.
 He dared not stop or look back, he simply ran.
 And prayed.

 grand audience hall was fabulously lit through grandiose arched windows
 on either side.
 Sunlight glistened off the brass and gold etched everywhere around the
 hall, from chandeliers to decorative ornaments, marked with the livery
 of the Castigator.
 Crests and banners engraved with family mottoes, finely crafted from materials
 of the highest quality, hung in carefully positioned places around the
 hall, denoting their respective family's status, lineage, and nobility.

\begin_layout Standard
Sweet aromas of burnt incense, cinnamon and musk permeated the air, bouquets
 of freshly picked flowers from young maidens with the colors of the rainbow
 were abundantly strewn around in neat vases and edifices all around the
 thick marble pillars that supported the magnificently painted dome, depicting
 wondrous scenes from the history, mythology, and tradition of the Outer
 Territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A ruckus of tingling bells and a limerick tune of chords echoed in the vastness
 of the audience hall, a single tinny voice singing along:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The jester played out the last part of the tune, merrily dancing around
 the main hall, a wide smile seemingly permanently carved on his painted,

 As he hit the last of the chords, he ended his performance with a wide
 curved bow towards the man who sat in the center of the audience throne,
 his sole spectator, and waited there, for a few moments, until he heard
 a morose voice:

 his hands mockingly grasping at an imaginary waist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator seemed to offer a little time to the idea, but a disapproving
 nod of his head made the jester suddenly wear the face of a crying, hurt
 man, shoulders slumped, hands knead together, as if pleading.

 mock athletic gestures, like running, jumping and javelin throwing, flexing
 pitiful muscles, kneeling and offering an invisible crown to the Castigator,
 looking as solemn and expressionless as a grave.

\begin_layout Standard
While he seemed to ponder the idea, the jester scurried soundlessly near
 the table where the goblet of wine lay, and with a wide grin forming on
 his shallow face once again, he mischievously reached for it.
 The Castigator took notice, but said nothing.
 Eyes darting to and fro, the jester sipped some wine off the goblet, painted
 lips smearing its bronze, delicately decorated surface, with white powder
 and red and violet paint.
 As the jester closed his eyes and savored the exquisite vintage, he felt
 icy steel hard against his throat.

 he make a note.

Well, no matter.

 the goblet.

Another sip? Ha! There you go Perconal, you actually made me laugh.

 it.
 And Perconal, the Jester, helplessly ran about the marble floor, trying
 to sip as much of the spilled wine as he could, his bells and jingles ringing
 and echoing in the empty hall.

 feet were sore.
 Cold air rushed to meet his face, the flimsy cloak offering a little less
 than adequate protection.
 Tall grass grew on either side of the rocky path through the hills.
 The cries of a crow accompanied the howling gusts of the wind, the sky
 a bleak gray, just like the days before.
 He looked around, searching for some kind of shelter at least until the
 wind died down.
 He knew he had to rest soon, his body ached and his legs felt like lead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spotted a large bark of a tree, a large oak, hollowed out, grizzly and
 old.
 He made a rush of straining effort to reach it quickly, further up the
 hill.
 A little more pain and then he could sit for a change.
 Perhaps even sleep, cold wind or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The oak was a perfect fit, large enough to lay down with only a small opening
 a lean man had to go through sideways.
 He was lean.
 And hungry, cold, tired and groggy.
 As he put down his knapsack, he grimaced with pain from stiff muscles.
 He lay down, on the ground, and felt like all his cares and troubles in
 the world were suddenly lifted, he felt light as a feather, numbness encircling
 his senses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stretched his feet and looked up, a small crack on the bark letting the
 sky seep through.
 His sight wandered to the clouds passing overhead, gray tints on blue black
 mattresses, like forlorn shapes running through a twisting, foaming river.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He closed his eyes, and muttered a prayer, thanking his God for the timely
 shelter, feeling he was being looked after, cared for, like his pilgrimage
 was an extraordinary thing, a matter of grave importance, a mission he
 had to carry out, a mission worthy of every little help.
 All he had to do was have faith, and he would persevere, and his God would
 keep a watchful eye, and provide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon, he fell asleep, laying there seemingly dead as the wood around him.
 He dreamt, but he would remember nothing when he would wake up.
 His chest rose and fell in a slow, laborious rhythm.
 And all around the oak, the grass bend where the wind blew.
 And the crows had stopped their crying, some of them perched on the very
 same oak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few drops of rain started falling, and pretty soon it turned into a drizzle,
 thin and almost refreshing, a gift of shower the earth accepted eagerly.
 He was dry, and he was warm.
 He thought to himself,

first thing that assaulted Hilderich's senses were the smells.
 Lost in a smelting crowd of city people, the smells were overpowering:
 the acrid sweat of unkempt horses mingled with rosewood and cinder scraps
 from the carpenters' workshops, heavy spices like cinnamon and uwe flared
 his nostrils while an essence of oils and meats wandered through the air,
 the smell of filthy beggars waxing and waning around every corner, its
 temporary absence filled in with incense from close by temples and intoxicating
 perfumes from passing, illustrious carriages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mix of sounds though felt familiar, reminding him of bees buzzing through
 the meadows back home, whole swarms feeding on the nectar of roleva flowers,
 over a golden carpet swaying gently under the evening gale.
 Now and then some voices stood taller than the rest, hints of selling wares
 and the ever present and watchful Ministers announcing laws, edicts and
 verdicts, punishments, and religious texts, all for the good of the people.
 The cacophony was further accented by the clacking sounds of hooves, pig
 cries and beggars' pleas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tall arches overhead cast angled shadows everywhere, the encircling walls
 of the buildings like sheer cliffs towering over the palpitating mass of
 people, animals and all the rest that could not readily fit into either
 category.
 Blue-gray rock and lime mortar dominated the market's landscape, the wear-torn
 cobblestones of the streets a hazy washed white wherever the grit and mass
 of people allowed a small glimpse.
 And street after street, wall after wall, bronze engraved plaques embellished
 with holy texts and iconography hung on arches, balconies and posts, in
 favor of the Gods, in memory and glory of the Castigator and the Pantheon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the market was the heart of the city as its inhabitants claimed, then
 what was said of Pyr being a heartless bitch seemed at once both right
 and wrong.
 Every single cast, class and type of man was to be found here, buying,
 selling, begging, stealing, killing, blackmailing and dying.
 There were parts of the market where the suns had never shown upon them
 since the city was built, dark corners where those who entered usually
 did not reappear, and when they did, blood not their own had been spilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beggars had become part of the landscape, blinds, invalids, all sorts
 of castaways and society's detritus, tugging away at embroidered hems,
 pleading with sore voices and grotesque faces.
 Those of them who bothered the wrong people time and again were soon beaten
 or stabbed to death by lackeys and guardsmen, left for dead on the spot,
 attracting the ire of honest, hard working merchants and artisans for not
 having the decency to crawl away from near their workshops and stalls and
 die someplace else where they would not put off potential customers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this was at the same time the place where everything of import came
 to be; this was where produce from the surrounding fields and indeed neighborin
g territories was gathered and sold to those who could afford it.
 This was where artisans created common everyday wares, materials and tools
 as well as delicate, commissioned works of art, this was the place were
 deals and partnerships were entered and broken, contracts signed and carried
 out, where everyone, whether a layman or a noble, had some kind of business.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the place were the Ministers' chants were heard every day, preaching,
 teaching, and enforcing the religion that is Law.
 The market, in that sense, was a living representation, a miniature of
 where and how the people of Pyr lived their lives, and even how some of
 them lost them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was drifting along the current of people flowing incessantly through
 the market, occasionally bumping onto variously indifferent or protesting
 men, taking care of the treads of carts, running heralds and practicing
 pickpockets.
 He could hear the Minister from the next street calling out a long list
 of names, and his eye caught two men in an unlit alley cracking another
 man's skull, their shadowy outline briskly contrasting with the lit background
 of the large street behind the small alley.
 It seemed dishearteningly clear that this was business as usual here, that
 some code of practice had been followed and the formalities obeyed, killing
 a faceless man hidden away from the light of the suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His almost random course took him closer to the Minister's spot, an elaborate
 fountain made of granite, engraved with scenes of an historic battle from
 the Heathen times he could remember learning about as a child, but could
 not immediately recognize.
 The Minister held a distaff on one hand, heavy-looking and oblique, and
 was still reading names off a long unwinding scroll fitted in some kind
 of extensible hook on the distaff that seemed purposefully designed.
 He wore a long robe made of violet velvet with a gold embroidered hem and
 a silver-lined crest of the Outer Territories on his chest, a small black
 cap with a single emerald denoting his office, and both of the robe's arms
 were filled with holy texts written in Lingua Helica, stitched in purple
 silk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ministers Hilderich had known made offerings to the Gods, upheld the
 Law and taught it.
 These holy men seemed somewhat distasteful, one might even call them pompous.
 He wondered what Master Olom's remark would have been and he was reminded
 of the duty he had yet to fulfill.
 He ignored the small mass of people gathered around the Minister as well
 as the rest of the still unfolding list of names, and lost himself once
 more in the throng of people, his senses acutely attuned by now, searching
 for a sign that would bring him a step closer to finding the one man he
 was searching for ever since that fateful night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought of the word conjured in his mind a brief glimpse of that night,
 an almost morbid recollection of what had happened.
 He had barely had time to stop and ponder the minutiae, while trying to
 get to Pyr as fast as possible, the place where he had to start his possibly
 vain search.
 The more he thought about what had exactly happened, the more he failed
 to grasp how everything had come crashing down like an avalanche, one moment
 of perfect stillness followed by sheer and utter terror, an unavoidable
 terrible fate.
 Such was the end of Master Olom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though he would not admit to it, he felt he somehow cheated death on
 that night, that it should have been him rather than his Master, or at
 least he should have had the same luck, at least as a matter of principle.
 Thankfully, wise Olom, though considered a relative unknown, with a handful
 of friends and none in high places, thought otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Never pausing in his stride, Hilderich closed his eyes and clutched the
 keystone his master had entrusted him with, ever so tightly.
 He had taken extra precautions ever since he had to carry the strange artifact
 with him.
 He always kept it on his person, and had fashioned a small metal holder
 with a small but sturdy chain fastened to his thick leather belt, resembling
 more the small cage of a sparrow, made of thin sheets of metal he had scrounged
 off the stables of an inn, the second day since he ran away from that explosion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That inexplicable explosion of light and heat, like hundreds of oil barrels
 and steamers going off at once, only neither was to be found even a day's
 ride away, much less unaccountably stored there at the keep.
 It could be something Ancient, it must have been something Ancient.
 But his knowledge of the Old People and their ways and artifacts was still
 little, and as far as he knew, no such examples were in master Olom's care,
 nor had he seen or heard any hint of such awesomely destructive or powerful
 items during the last four years.
 But, what else could it be? Unless the Gods had revealed themselves in
 blessed fury and might.
 Wouldn't they have spared his master?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He let out a sigh without noticing, his head slightly slumped, his expression
 sour.
 He had been so deeply engrossed in thought, that when he ventured a look
 he found himself utterly lost with no sense of direction, in a part of
 the market conspicuously calm, lacking the overwhelming mass of people
 that offered a false sense of safety that was nevertheless more welcome
 than none at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distant din of the market proper could still be heard, but he had walked
 quite a distance and the crowd of people looked a little more than a milling
 sea of garments and bustling feet.
 With the corner of his eye he glimpsed a pair of shady figures was stalking
 him, probably had been for a while, and were just about to gang up on him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was not a stoutly built fellow, and did not consider himself neither
 a man of action or capable of putting up a serious fight.
 But he had faith in his master, and his quest preceded everything else.
 He had to preserve his life in order to preserve the keystone, so he chose
 the most viable and logical course of action under the circumstances: he
 ran like hell.

He suddenly darted off towards the direction of what seemed to be a large
 bell tower, and ventured a slight look over his left shoulder to get the
 bearing of the figures behind him.
 They were just beyond hand's reach when he started running, his heavy cloak
 waving wildly, feet scurrying on the cobbled street.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them cursed profoundly and the other one shouted at him to stop,
 then both of them went on a chase after him.
 Hilderich went right and left through alleys and larger streets, sometimes
 under shadow and others under light, trying to keep the tower that somehow
 seemed a safe place in sight, while at the same time trying to give his
 pursuers the slip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sound of boots on stone was still unmistakably behind him, and sweat
 had started to pour out of his body.
 He went past small houses, inns, and squares, while fleeing for what seemed
 his life, and curiously enough his mind registered that not a housewife
 or elder man ventured more than an indifferent look at the chase taking
 place in front of their eyes, only the children paused in their play to
 look, point and giggle excitedly.

\begin_layout Standard
His feet started to ache and his breathing became short and almost painful,
 fire welling up in his lungs.
 He knew he could not keep this up for long, and the tower he had set out
 to reach did not seem much closer than earlier.
 He ventured a slight look over his right shoulder, and couldn't see either
 of the figures chasing him.
 He listened intently for a few moments and could not make out the distinct
 noise of chasing boots, only rather his own two feet galloping achingly.
 He allowed himself a drop in pace, easing his breathing, coming to a slow
 stop near a shadowy wall, bent over with hands on his knees, throwing scared
 looks around, hoping that the chase was over now.

 instinctively turning around, seeing a flash of light hinting at an unsheathed
 knife or sword, its wholeness under the cover of dark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment he drew enough of a breath to dart off again in another random
 direction, slipping away at the last minute like before, but then he noticed
 the other man, a red-haired bearded brute, pieces of armor showing underneath
 his shabby clothes, a jagged knife in hand, standing a few paces to his
 right, steadfastly covering both ways out of his predicament.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With no real options left, Hilderich suddenly leaped on the nearest man,
 blade or not, in what could only really be a selfless last act of defiance,
 thinking he was soon about to die, failing his master for the last time.
 Nevertheless, he would give his all, and while he leaped his gathered his
 fist aiming for the man's head, trying to deliver as much pain as possible.
 The punch never connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man still standing inside the shadows expertly and calmly took a step
 back and bend his back slightly, with Hilderich's wild effort going awry,
 hitting nothing but air, losing his balance and making a counter-step.
 Just as he could feel his face freeze in astonishment, he brought his other
 hand backwards in order to try and have another go at punching his assailant.
 He did not manage that in any event though, because he winced and doubled-up
 at the paralyzing pain from the knee that had firmly and powerfully connected
 with his belly.
 He felt his stomach empty itself of its contents and his sight go blurry,
 a hint of red clogging his sight, his feet going limp and heavy, his breathing
 shallow.
 The last thing he saw before he passed out, was a grinning mouth and the
 icy clear flash of a steel blade.

 hair smack against her face.
 She drew the bedsheets against her body, curling up onto the empty side
 of her bed.
 She felt the unborn child inside her stir uncomfortably, as if awoken with
 terror by the same dream.
 She laid her hands on her belly, gently caressing it, feeling the child
 inside calm down, freely flowing in an inner, warm sea of love and protection.

The unborn fell silent, his tiny heart barely stating it was alive and well
 inside his mother's womb.
 The mother on the other hand, was still visibly shaken from her vision.
 She saw rivers of blood engulfing her and her child, and fires bright as
 the sun all around her.
 She saw Amonas' head on a pike, along with hundreds of other men's heads,
 hellishly put on display in a gory show, seething masses of animals rather

The hair on her back was raised and she felt as helpless as a thawing flake
 of snow, unable to comfort herself and lay back to sleep, the shocking
 images of her sleep having burned through her waking heart and mind.
 She stood up with some effort, and with slow attentive paces, made it to
 the balcony.
 The night was invitingly chilly, offering a crystal clear sky, the few
 clouds overhead like thin gossamer webs the Gods might have woven to catch
 a falling star.

She peered out over the never-sleeping city, its market always alight with

The Ministry Tower and the Disciplinarium were lit as bright as day, proud
 banners flung high and wide, a procession of ministers underway, and another

 and splashes of green and blue light, as if there was not a care in the
 whole world.

\begin_layout Standard
The rugged brown stonework of the balcony felt rough under her smooth touch.
 She moved her hand unconsciously across the stone while gazing at the city,
 vainly searching for her loved one among the sands of men.
 Her hand seemed to dance, ebbing and flowing to a melody even she herself
 couldn't hear, like conducting an invisible chorus of spirits of old inhabiting
 this very stone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She closed her eyes momentarily and the image of Amonas' head haunted her,
 his blood still pouring hot.
 She held her breath and moved her lips in silent prayer, wishing her dream
 was nothing more than simple fear of what lay ahead.
 Her faith should not waver, she must be strong enough for Amonas' sake,
 and for their unborn child.
 Let the Gods carry them forward and all will be as it should be.

Her child stirred once more, soothing her soul and bringing a faint smile

 She went back inside, laid herself on her bed, her hands resting on the

 She dreamt no more that night.

 The cot felt uncomfortable, hos body protesting slightly to his efforts

 Puzzlement showed on his face, and then the man who had bested him addressed

 but it was not there.
 They had taken the keystone.
 Had he failed already? Was there a point to all this? His face took on

 Do you wish to eat now? I know we have been less than welcoming, but the
 circumstances got the better of us.

Hilderich pondered this for a while and in his mind dismissed the idea the
 food would be poisoned, since if they wanted him dead, they wouldn't have
 bothered with all this.
 It seemed somewhat of a concession to the man effectively holding him captive,
 but the inescapable reality of not having eaten for more than a whole day
 struck home in the end.
 He nodded in acknowledgement and then added verbally:

Hilderich just shook his head in disbelief, a small sigh escaping his lips.
 Amonas smiled ever more broadly at that particular reaction, and pretty

Philo returned and entered through the door with some difficulty due to
 the fact he was trying to balance two plates of stew on one hand and arm

 He precariously managed to reach the safety of a nearby table, putting
 the bowl down first, and then unloading the plate off his arm.
 Seeing that no one cared to assist him he threw around a few looks of mixed

 Disciplinarium's large audience hall was exquisitely decorated with fine
 tapestries, hung from the columns and walls with golden ropes and aggrandized
 with silk laces, freshly picked fragrant flowers and all manners of highly
 luxurious pomp and ceremony.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though night had already fallen, giant ornate silver and brass chandeliers
 hung from the high ceilings, illuminating the grand hall with the light
 of thousands candles, their beams of light enhanced and mirrored by the
 all the brass, gold and silver decorations strewn around almost every object
 in the hall, making them glitter and shine, magnifying their splendor tenfold.
\end_layout

Delicately detailed lifelike oil paintings adorned each wall, previous Castigato

 families of the Castigator, every last important person that was notably
 recorded in history books was to be found here in the form of awe inspiring
 portraits, paintings and sculptures from the most talented artists of each
 generation from around the lands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mass of people was still flowing slowly but steadily into the hall,
 and for a time it would seem like the small swarm of men was going to swell
 to inelegant numbers.
 But the Castigator's people who were in charge of the eventful night, those
 who orchestrated and planned who was to be given the praise of summons,
 also decided the place and time of his appearance as well as whether or
 not he should have the privilege of being able to dine at the same table
 as the Castigator, albeit always at an innocuous distance, a table seat
 that implied an immense increase of status and almost unrivaled political
 power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the time for the opening ceremonies for the grand festive night grew
 closer, all needed preparations were being doubly checked, and the gathering
 of guests efficiently monitored.
 Everything seemed to be in place, refreshments and drinks served in silver
 plated cups, and sweetmeats, fruit, and fine pastries circulating among
 the crowd in golden platters by busy servants, dressed in fine cloth wearing
 the green livery of the Castigator's office, a white eagle bearing a book
 and a key, a snake held in its beak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People were chatting in low voices, politely exchanging greetings and news
 when being personal acquaintances, though some of the more brazen guests
 that either lacked the knowledge of etiquette or were in a position to
 ignore it as a whole or in part, were already laughing heartily at jokes
 or anecdotes between friends and close acquaintances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone attending had been careful to dress as stylishly as possible, and
 according to wealth and status, there were examples of extravagant overdressing
, with some people resembling moving heaps of a treasury or jewelry shop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Others preferred to overstate their presence with exotic cloths and tailorings,
 usually uncommon and outlandish, suggesting time and money spent just for
 this one occasion.
 Indeed, everyone was wearing the best and brightest they could afford,
 and maybe some had even took on a loan to have something special tailor-made
 in order to try and stand out in the crowd, in a bid to improve their fame
 and fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The atmosphere in the hall was generally convivial though mildly restrained
 because of the premises and significance of the night.
 The festivities were taking place in order to commemorate the Castigator's
 25th Term in Office, which coincided with the Pacification of Zaelin, the
 last of the Territories to be enlightened and brought under the Law of
 the Pantheon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rumors circulated among the nobles' elite and people in the army and the
 Ministry that the Castigator would be announcing a decision of major importance
 that would stir up the relatively still affairs of the Territories, perhaps
 ushering a new era of glory to the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, it would be an eventful night, with dancing troupes of wondrous
 abilities, unsurpassed technique and airy grace performing for the duration,
 bards of worldly renown and enchanting voices singing the Mythos in praise
 of the Castigator and the Pantheon, a telling re-enactment of the Pacification
 of Zaelin and the striking down of the last Heathen, Parnoth Larthiel,
 the Last Ignorant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The re-enactment would also offer a kind of prize to one of the guests who
 would be lucky enough for his name to be drawn amongst hundreds: he would
 have the chance to play as the Castigator in the final duel with Parnoth,
 the unclaimed role filled in by a lawbreaker due for execution.
 The honored guest in killing the lawbreaker-Parnoth would be spilling heretic
 blood in the service of the Ministry, the Castigator and the Law, possibly
 the highest service to the Pantheon possible, save sacrificing one's self
 while enforcing or upholding the Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A huge oblong platinum chime resounded by the stroke of an ornamental ram
 swung by two Protectors, the Castigator's personally hand-picked guard,
 and judging by their imposing physical builds apparently chosen chiefly
 for their brawn.
 The sound of the chime drowned out the chatter of the milling guests, reverbera
ting with a majestic effect in the audience hall, and signaling the official
 commencement of the festivities.
 Acoustics was one of many things not left to chance when the grandiose
 chamber was built.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd of guests went silent and ushered by dutiful servants and thick-set
 expressionless Protectors, gathered on two opposing sides of the hall,
 leaving a wide stretch of room where the Castigator would soon walk on.
 Indeed, the voice of the Chief Functionary boomed like a cannon in the
 night:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

All kneel or be chastised, for now enters this hall his Holy Piousness,
 Olorius Menamon the IV th, Deliverer of Aconia, Pacifier of Zaelin, Proxy

 Territories.
 Kneel or be chastised!

, the last words uttered with the gravity of a holy commandment, the obvious
 threat to be carried out with ruthless deliberation if needs be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At once and in concert, the whole of the crowd, including servants, Protectors,
 Ministers, the whole of the Disciplinarium's staff, any and all figures
 of authority, military, civil or religious, including the Chief Functionary,
 knelt on both legs and bowed their heads deeply and solemnly, as if in
 wholehearted prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The workings of some kind of large mechanism involving gears and other mechanica
l contraptions rang through the audience hall, and the massive copper tinted
 Gates of Leor opened slowly but steadily, revealing the radiant form of
 the Castigator, breathtakingly dressed in the formal robes of his Office,
 a deep crimson color dyed in the blood of heathens and heretics, solid
 golden runes written in Helica Pretoria adorning the hem, and the Book
 of Law covering its surface with silk threads so fine that the artisans
 went blind from the effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And above the robes, an immaculate platinum breastplate, with no carvings,
 etchings or any decoration whatsoever.
 On one side, hung Urtis, the Mace of Judgment, the Castigator's long ago
 chosen tool of enlightenment and battle, that was said to have cracked
 as many heretic skulls as there are stones in the walls of the Disciplinarium.
 Indeed, some claim the very same skulls have been used in building the
 majestic building, as a morbid reminder that All is Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator strode with a steady pace down the central lane where a raised
 block of marble floor had appeared in sync with the opening of the Gates.
 The only audible sound was the sound of the Castigator's boots, a simple,
 utilitarian set of metal plated boots a soldier would wear, finely polished,
 but otherwise quite common.
 When he reached the dais on which the Seat of Office stood, he surveyed
 the crowd momentarily, sat down and clapped his bare hands once.

And the Castigator echoed back the mantra in solemn ritual, his voice carrying
 unusual depth and mesmerizing melody for a single man, however powerful
 and unique he may be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those that saw the Castigator and had not been granted such an honor before
 in their lives, were immediately left awestruck, and some of them broke
 down weeping, pious fervor instantly occupying their hearts and minds.
 Those that had been so blessed before, did not immediately stand but rather
 silently prayed with tears welling in their eyes, before being able to
 stand upright.
 The people that kept closer to the Castigator, his immediate entourage,
 the Ruling Council, and his guard intoned the holy mantra reverently and
 resumed their places and functions.
\end_layout

The Castigator then addressed the crowd which stood there reverently, their
 excitement and waiting evident in their glittering eyes and tense faces:

The Castigator's voice turned from a sweet melody into a harsh pragmatist's
 staccato tone, then back in a wavering, almost pleading tone, evoking sympathy
 and familiarity.
 The Chief Functionary struck down his distaff on the granite floor once,
 and spoke aloud while nodding condescendingly, bearded chin almost touching

His voice rang true and clear around the chamber, his message inviolate

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the Ministers, Generals and other officials of the Disciplinarium,
 were apparently surprised, though they instantly recovered a measure of
 composure and if one had not been eying them constantly, they would have
 looked easily unperturbed by the announcement and its implications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Procrastinator Militant in his exquisite armor and fine silk sash was
 at a loss for words, and opened his mouth wide-eyed as if in protestation
 but his disciplined service and training so far kicked in, and barely managed

 saying

 Militant, as if waiting for a sidestep or slip that would bring him crashing
 down in a most shameful and undignified way, an affront to the significance
 of the night.
 
\end_layout

The Noble Representative, dressed in a simple green robe of the practical

 kill the Procrastinator Militant's career.

 around, seeking food, drink, or whoever they had been talking with before
 the Castigator entered the hall.
 The announcement of setting out to pacify the last wild region, the Widelands,
 was definitely going to spur debate, however hushed, controlled, and unchalleng

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lord Umsepyre Remis, the Noble Representative, was seated in the council
 in order to speak on behalf of the noble families of the Outer Territories.
 His was a purely consultatory role, expressing current views among the
 noble houses, informing the Ruling Council of the ebbs and flows of power,
 wealth, and status, as well as the reactions and thoughts of the nobles
 on affairs of state, religion and Law.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though he had no voting rights in the Council, his input was often
 quite impossible to receive otherwise, any network of informers too crude
 in comparison.
 The Castigator seemed to consider him a quite valuable asset, judging by
 the special dispensations recently attributed to House Remis.
 In return, Umsepyre Remis was the best insightful eye and ear the Noble
 houses had concerning the inner workings of the Ministry and the Castigator,
 and solid knowledge of what went on in the Disciplinarium sometimes could
 buy things money could not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His was a unique position where he could not be accounted for practically
 anything since he was not part of the decision making process, but was
 amply able to exchange information and insight as he saw fit to better
 suit his House's, and person's, continued survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled brightly at the still uneasy Procrastinator Militant, and made
 a gesture to straighten his shoulder-high long black hair, in an almost
 too bland demonstration of cool confidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music that would accompany the dancing acts had started with a brass
 fanfare, and soon settling in a soft string melody, oddly scented here
 and there by flutes and bass drums, the dancers performing choreographed
 scenes from the Mythos, reliving the handing down of the Law from the Gods
 to men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch noted the interest on Lord Remis face who was more than visibly
 enchanted by the dancers' performance, while the Procrastinator Militant
 had hurriedly called for his chief aide, more so in order to look busy
 and industrious, rather than because actual operational planning could
 be done at this time and place.
 The Arch-minister was indeed busy on the other hand, a trio of scribes
 jotting down notes and letters to be sent immediately, notifying key personnel
 of the imminent rush of preparations that needed to start as soon as possible.

 It was hunting time for owls, wild dogs and wengals.
 He sat down on the cold, humid grass, legs crossed, walking stick leaned
 on his left shoulder.
 He rummaged through his ever lightening knapsack for something to eat.
 With little fuss, he managed to come up with a meager meal: worrain berries
 and a piece of goat's cheese, still fresh and spongy.

The people in the village he went through last were the usual sort in these
 parts: animal herders mostly and a few wheat farmers.
 Simple people that prayed solemnly to the Gods, every day, wishing not
 for riches, power, lands and wives or other things of vanity beyond their
 grasp.
 They wished their child be spared of illness and harm, their herds be still
 whole by nightfall, the snow be light this year, and the rain plenty before
 harvest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fools then.
 He could feel sympathy like a man with sight feels for a man in the dark
 who has never seen golden fields in springtime and the piercing depth-less
 eyes of a young maiden, but no more.
 Even blind men wish for light to shine yet before their lives are ended.
 These folk, just tread on, and never think otherwise.
 He wouldn't spare them more than a passing thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His road was about to take him through the Widelands, an unforgiving place.
 Few had made the passing, and even fewer were left sane and unscathed in
 body, soul and mind once they did.
 There were stories and legends about the Widelands, that were passed down
 from generation to generation, in many languages of many folk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of them he determined, were the superstitious tales of simpletons and
 madmen, mere fantasies for common people to spent the grinding, toiling
 days, thankful of their safe, ordinary, almost pitiful lives.
 Some were invariably twisted second and third-hand tales of those who ventured
 into the accursed place and came back, surely not wholesome and well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fact and fiction were interwoven tightly in such accounts, but some probable,
 shared truths could be distilled from the broth of rumblings, mutterings,
 and assorted hearsay that permeated the inns and taverns all across the
 Territories.
 There were even a few written accounts by people who seemed to have genuinely
 made the journey, and live to tell the tale and become rich and famous
 in the process, but most of them seemed to be very talented liars and writers,
 the distinction in their works of little significance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the Tale of Umberth could be counted as less than nefarious, since
 he set out with a hundred-score of men, of whom barely three survived:
 Umberth, his esquire Esphalon and a woman, then only a child, who Umberth
 claimed was found wandering alone, mute and dark-skinned, almost pitch-like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Umberth spent the rest of his days and sizable fortune trying to organize
 further trips into the Widelands, his few unsuccessful efforts presenting
 the girl as living proof of his sayings of underground cities, height-defying
 towers and huge arching constructs, but the girl could not even speak her
 name.
 Her skin color was a singular phenomenon that more often than not provoked
 the wrath of the Ministers and the aversion of crowds, speaking of heresy
 against the Gods and the bastard offspring of heathens and beasts of old
 that the earth unveiled from time to time to test the faithful and attract
 the blasphemer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not long after the Ministry declared her as well as Umberth heretics, an
 unrelenting manhunt together with the watchful, ever pious and dutiful
 believers of the Pantheon bore fruit and Umberth and the girl were beheaded
 and their bodies burned to ashes in Pyr, in the winter of the third pacificum,
 153rd annum, 51 days before the Solstice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Esphalon, his esquire, was sentenced to silence unto death and exiled, never
 to utter a word in his life again, his tongue cut out.
 He then wandered the northern lands, surviving on little more than worms
 and lichen, possibly wishing death for himself.
 In those lands, he came upon a small tribe of nomads, wild men that knew
 not how to herd sheep and work metal or clay, with wooden spears and no
 command of fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what Esphalon later describes, when he was trapped and caught like
 animal prey, probably destined for a savage death, perhaps a sacrifice
 or plain and simple cannibalism, the savages noticed while they searched
 his clothing a small plaque of metal, hand-sized, with no discerning characteri
stics other than a circular notch in its center, a memento from the Widelands.
 When they noticed that, Esphalon was greeted among them as an equal, a
 member of the tribe lost and found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He soon realized the importance of that plaque, and was further mystified.
 The savages used it to produce light and heat, by placing an ordinary stone,
 even a pebble, inside the notch.
 Pebbles and stones were the most widely used since they could be found
 in abundance in the northern rocky steppes were these people seemed to
 roam unhindered.
 Sometimes they used animal bones or pieces of wood, mostly whatever was
 handy at the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invariably, the said item slowly seemed to shrink and then vanish into thin
 air in a matter of moments, and then pleasant sunlight and radiant heat
 would emanate from the plaque for hours to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this and much more is written in Esphalon's memoirs, a corrugation of
 the things he saw and experienced in the wild lands coupled with what little
 time he spent with the savages.
 The plaque remained with the savage men who would not part with it in any
 way, and Esphalon reached an isolated fishing harbor facing the Pangalor
 Sea, half-dead from starvation, exhaustion, and lost a leg and three fingers
 from frostbite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was there were he wrote the Pangalor Scrolls, the single half-consistent
 work that contains enough about the Widelands to make it useful in crossing
 it, and perhaps uncovering more about this mysterious land and living long
 enough for others to know as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His reverie was broken by the cries of a nighthawk swooping in to catch
 his prey, somewhere out in the star-lit fields of short grass and poppies
 swinging gently in the night breeze.
 He marveled at the arrogant precision and expert flying of the nighthawk,
 which made no effort to catch his prey unguarded, but instead seemed to
 announce indifferently it was about to kill and then feast on a helpless,
 doomed, animal soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled thinly and then got up, fastened his knapsack, picked up his walking
 stick and set off down the marble road.
 He looked overhead and saw the nighthawk soaring triumphantly, a small
 snake writhing in its death throes, captured in its beak.
 The nighthawk cried into the night once more, and then disappeared over
 the distance, its faint silhouette mingled with the starry blue and black
 sky.

 they had eaten, after Amonas conferred with Philo, the burly man said he
 would be back soon.
 Hilderich had relaxed somewhat, but he could not for the life of him fathom
 the two men.
 It might be just as well.
 When he had seen whatever it was they wanted to show him, perhaps they
 would stick true to their word and release him, let go and consider him
 a friend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wasn't sure how exactly a person who planned overthrowing plots of heresy
 could afford to just tell people then let them go and trust their good
 souls to tell not, but he had a feeling it involved some kind of pain,
 extortion, or good old fashioned fall-assisted life removal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It just struck him odd.
 He felt he could trust this man, but his mind reeled at the prospect.
 I must be going slightly mad, he thought to himself.
 He was starting to think of ways he could snatch that keystone and make
 a run for it, but the more he thought about it the more stupid he felt.
 They had already outran him and outsmarted him once.
 Certainly he was no match for either one of them in single even unarmed
 combat.
 He now belatedly wished he had taken some time to practice his body rather
 than spent most of it knee deep in curatoria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What mattered was that for now, he decided his best chances lay in playing
 along, and seeing what it was that they promised would change his mind
 and heart forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The faint dusk had just given way to a pure, clean night.
 As he lay there in his cot, he noticed Amonas had lit a large candle, and
 was reading what seemed to be letters.
 He noticed the man had been rather drawn into his reading material and
 decided against indiscretion on his part.
 Amonas through the corner of his eye though was aware of Hilderich mild
 scrutiny and without lifting his head from his reading, he said to him
 in an inviting, conversational tone:

Still thinking of how and when to escape Hilderich? You are more lively

 There will be no need.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Amonas looked him levelly, his gruff voice adding an air of authenticity
 Hilderich hadn't noticed so far.
 Perhaps he was being afflicted with a disease of the mind, something in
 the food.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he felt alright otherwise, he did not believe he was poisoned or otherwise
 tampered with.
 He just could not believe he was having a normal conversation with a person
 who was either mentally deranged or emphatically dangerous, a heretic nonethele
ss!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's thoughts were interrupted by Philo who entered the small room,
 hood still on his head.
 He nodded to Amonas, who in turn said to Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich stood up and Amonas offered him a hooded cloak, somewhat more
 fine and more elegant than most.
 As soon as he wore it, Amonas was instructing Philo to lead them on and
 out into the city.
 Amonas would be trailing, and Hilderich would be in the middle, evidently
 a small precaution on their part should he feel a sudden urge to run like
 hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo lead them through somewhat shady alleys, light from far away lamps
 barely reaching them.
 They angled left and right, as if evading unseen stalkers.
 Perhaps there were some indeed.
 He would not be able to see them or smell them until too late in any case.
 So he trudged along.
 His knowledge of the city streets was perfunctory at best, but even he
 could discern that they were walking towards the Disciplinarium's hill.
 Even from a distance, the sounds of music and festivities could be heard,
 and a light show of fireworks seemed to be underway as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich mused in spite himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are we invited then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas smiled wryly and urged him forward, while Philo turned his head around
 and stabbed Hilderich with his eyes.
 His attempt at humor went unanswered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more they approached the Disciplinarium, the more care they took in
 their approach, triple checking alleyways, hunching over shadows, their
 feet as light as cats', not a sound other than shallow breathing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they reached the base of the Disciplinarium's hill, Philo signaled
 them to stop dead in their shoes.
 He let a guard patrol vanish behind the curve of the hill's base before
 urging them to rush for a certain part of the slope, where the shadow of
 the aqueduct overhead would conceal them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did so with a dancer's grace and reached the grassy part of slope Philo
 had indicated.
 He took out a small knife from his belt, and Hilderich watched in still
 surprise as he dug out a small piece of tuft.
 A metal dial was to be found underneath, which then Amonas proceeded to
 twist left and right accordingly to some whim or unknown turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a sound a small tubular opening appeared above the dial, large enough
 for a man to fit inside but only in a prone position.
 It led into a shiny metal pipe or tube of some sort with a downward inclination
 whose other end was obscured in darkness, and judging from the light stream
 of air wafting through, it was a long pipe indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo nodded to Amonas and said,

\begin_layout Standard
Philo was already sliding inside the mysterious and intriguing metalwork,
 and muttered in a low voice what must have been a friendly obscenity, if
 such a notion exists.
 Amonas then ushered Hilderich inside, imparting a word of advice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Arms glued on your body.
 Count to thirty and then take a deep breath and hold it.
 You're not afraid of water are you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's terror was evident in the shrill quality of his voice.
 It had all happened too quickly to try and hold back, so when Amonas pushed
 him down the tubing, he tried to follow his advice, held his arms stiff
 to his body and started counting to thirty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tubing angled downwards pretty soon and Hilderich felt he was riding
 a children's slide, with the slight difference that the end of the slide
 was nowhere in sight, and mad, possibly delusional, quite certainly heretic
 thugs were shoving you down into one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich heard a splash echo dimly in the metal tubing, and was suddenly
 reminded of Amonas instruction.
 He wasn't sure if he had counted past thirty or not, his terror and anxiety
 mixed with his confounded thoughts a recipe against keeping calm and cool-heade
d.
 He filled his lungs with air as long as there was time anyway, and just
 when he started to think he had grievously mistimed his breath, he splashed
 into water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feeling was one of quite shock, the cold water encircling his whole
 body, seeping through his clothes, assaulting his ears and nostrils, as
 if trying to enter his body without his will.
 His eyes had closed instinctively, then he opened them slowly, searching
 for the open surface, his hands wobbling uncertainly, before a small primal
 fear of running out of air urged him to swim upwards, towards what seemed
 to be a faint source of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within moments his head was clear of the water.
 He exhaled momentarily, then breathed in gasps until he could find his
 normal breathing once more.
 An outstretched hand seemed to be offering to help him out of the water.
 As soon as he realized it belonged to Philo, he heard another splash of
 water roughly behind him, and turned his head to look even as Philo pulled
 him to somewhat dry land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Amonas, who seemingly more accustomed to the area, needed no help
 and within seconds was among them, tiny rivulets of water still running
 down his leather vest, thick drops of water falling from his forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Let us move.
 Hilderich, I would beg your silence.
 We are relatively safe as long as we are silent.

 gesture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

As if I've been screaming my lungs out.
 I'll keep my mouth shut.
 Are we near whatever place you think will change my mind? Are we below
 the Disciplinarium, by any chance?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, said Hilderich, while vainly trying to squeeze off some of the water.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

We are.

\begin_layout Standard
They had fallen inside a natural cistern in a small rocky cave.
 Strangely enough, light seemed to seep through some cracks in the walls.
 With a closer inspection, Hilderich saw the cracks were more akin to lichen,
 faintly wet to the touch, but rough like sand as well.
 A sort of crystal formation seemed to lie underneath such spots.
 Philo nudged him onward, cutting his examination of the peculiarity short.
 It reminded him of some lesser kind of curatoria, that his master was not
 particularly interested in, and thus were only lightly studied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the light they gave off was indeed enough, even though only barely,
 to walk the gently curving twists and turns of what seemed to be an extensive
 network of caves, an almost ant-like structure, deep underneath the Disciplinar
ium's hill.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He noticed the steady, purposeful stride of Amonas before him, and the dim
 blue and violet light that imparted a grim hue on everything around and
 including them.
 A feeling of eerie wariness started to seep in Hilderich.
 At length he tapped at Amonas shoulder, who paused, turned and looked directly
 at Hilderich, an expectant look on his face but not a sound coming out
 of his lips.
 Hilderich asked in a low voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are we lost?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas did not answer, but rather resumed his walk, taking them through
 caverns small and large and paths that could not be retraced unless with
 a map.
 The further down they went, the warmer it felt, and soon walking in the
 caves felt like a warm summer trip in the country.
 Hilderich had by now lost track of their approximate depth, direction,
 or distance of travel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps they were not lost, but he essentially was and thought he would
 be unable find his own way back if the opportunity presented itself.
 What good would it do though, since the tube was meant to go down, and
 not up? Just as he let out a sigh of hopelessness, he could discern light
 pouring out from the next corner, and feel their slight descend leveling
 out.
 By now his clothes felt almost dry, a slight feeling of dampness remaining
 in his feet and arms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The light grew more intense, a clear intense light like sunlight.
 But sunlight, so deep under the earth? Not to mention, it was still night
 outside.
 When they were only a few paces away from the corner that shone with light,
 Amonas threw up one arm, palm open, indicating a halt.
 He leaned over the corner of the rocky cave, and peered carefully for almost
 a minute, making sure they were safe.
 Hilderich was not in a position to know what he was keeping them safe from,
 or whether or not the possible threat was imaginary or real.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded that everything seemed as it should be, and walked out into
 the light.
 He blinked his eyes flinching as they adjusted to the brightness, and then
 gestured with his hand to Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich stepped forward as well, the bright light forcing him to instinctively
 cover his eyes with his right arm, the small peep of its shadow the only
 shelter against such sudden illumination.
 A fragrant waft of air rushed around them, as Philo joined them as well,
 and all three of them were slowly walking towards the light.
 As Hilderich's eyes finally adjusted to the light, he could see the rocky
 cave all around them give way to a smooth white surface, much like porcelain
 at first glance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These strange walls seemed to extrude themselves from the strata of cave
 rocks, as if totally alien and utterly old in origin.
 Then Hilderich's eyes wandered a bit more and then his gaze rested on the
 center of a huge chamber apparently made from the same white-ivory material.
 The chamber was cylindrical in shape, and from top to bottom a wide pillar
 which incredulously seemed to be made of pure light stood, a sight that
 defied Hilderich's senses and logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What is this place?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 light.

This is the first pillar of truth, Hilderich.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, Amonas said while edging closer to the pillar, Hilderich a couple of steps
 behind him, his face brightly illuminated, but his eyes unflinching.
 Philo stood at the rocky entrance to the chamber, with his back indifferently
 turned to the wondrous sight in front of their eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The truth? What is this, Amonas? Is it Ancient?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 mind off to some deep trench of thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It is my friend.
 A working piece of technology of the Ancients, buried deep under the Disciplina

 every word glistening with expectation.

Amonas grabbed Hilderich violently from both arms and attracted his total
 attention, his voice free of constraints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Studies! Scholars! Can't you really see what this means?Think of your Mythos!Thi
nk of your precious Law!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was visibly shaken as if coming around from a waking dream, eyes
 rolling around trying to come to grips with his surroundings and the man
 with the gruff voice in front of him, shouting at him and looking ready
 to snap him in two if he said the wrong thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He asked him to think of the Mythos, and the Law.
 The Law was the established religious canon that had replaced traditional
 secular law thousands of years earlier.
 The Mythos was the recorded history of the Gods handing down the Law unto
 the forsaken race of man, to save it from destruction and withering, to
 help men reach their Gods at the Time of Conjugation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Law instructs man that those he knew as Ancients were the manifestation
 of evil.
 That any tool or work of art or science whose workings cannot be seen with
 the naked eye or touched by naked hand are containers of evil.
 That there is only this land, and none other.
 That the lights in the sky were put there by the Gods, to make nights more
 bearable.
 That death is irrevocable and permanent, and those who do not uphold the
 Law, will be shunt forever, their souls kept away from the Gods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That any man, woman or child upholding belief in the Ancients or their works
 is a heretic, a vessel of corruption.
 That the Ministers, uphold and teach the Law to the people.
 That the people, in turn, devote themselves and their lives to abide the
 Law.
 That the Patriarch declares additional Law as he sees fit, never in contradicti
on to the basic tenements, and he alone chooses his successor.
 That a Castigator rules, a man of wisdom and strength to lead the people,
 protect them, enlighten the heathens, punish the lawbreakers and the heretics,
 and offer praise and glory to the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is what the Mythos and the Law say.
 Hilderich, though he did not consider himself the religious type, had always
 been careful not to attract the ire of the Ministers.
 He had memorized the Mythos and the Law, as part of his training and education,
 as is the case with most who are fortunate enough to be allowed to read
 and write, since he was apprentice to a Curator, a guild of men with special
 dispensation to hold and maintain approved artifacts from times past, some
 of which have nefarious origins, keeping strict indices of what is stored
 where.

Hilderich was considering the magnificent simplicity and awesome sight of
 the pillar of light in front of him, a bright pillar of sunlight not as
 blinding as the suns, with a hazy rainbow of all colors on its edges, a

 shell.
 He was interrupted somewhat violently by Amonas who neatly but decisively
 pushed him towards the pillar of light.

A man with no purpose in life is like a river without a sea to lose itself
 in.
 Such is the meaning of purpose, hard and defining, to lose oneself completely.
 Immerse one's essence in a journey with no visible end in the distance.
 Anything less is bound to bring about ennui, the crushing realization of
 our discrete physical form and its inadequacies.
 Anything less than steering oneself through life like the only real obstacle
 is death itself, leads to early death of the mind and the soul.
 I ask you, would you live life or stand by idly waiting for death? I chose
 to vanquish death altogether.

 mountain grew ever more unkind.
 Its many bare faces looked down upon a lonely figure, slowly but surely
 making its way through rock, gravel, low grass and loose dirt.
 His hood was down, revealing a stern but humble face.
 Care lines dotted his forehead, and one could easily spot he was not a
 man prone to laughing easily.
 His face was adorned by a beard grown out of necessity, not choice, and
 his thin long hair was unkempt, a few wild strand jutting in strange directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wind and the rain were thankfully absent on this day, awarding him the
 leisure of trudging along the mountainous path with only his sore feet
 and stiff legs to distract him from his effort.
 Indeed, he paused once again to rest for a moment, let his blood flow freely
 in his legs and feet, and take a moment to pray to God for his good fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat down on the naked rock, his buttocks well used by now to such discomforts.
 He touched his forehead with one had and brought out a small piece of knotted
 string with the other.
 His lips then moved in a silent orison, asking for more of the same good
 fortune, and perhaps a bush or nut-bearing tree from which to gather some
 much needed food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had not seen or heard signs of goats or other mountain-dwelling animals
 for days now.
 There was still some grass on these slopes, so there should have been herds
 or families of animals feeding.
 Perhaps there were many more richer plains and slopes far below, or in
 plateaus his path had not taken him through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it was pure chance that he had not seen a living soul, neither a
 bird or lizard and certainly not a goat.
 Perhaps it was his God, testing him for purity of heart and strength of
 purpose, to steel him further in order to come through the always perilous
 journey of Pilgrimage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was living on certain kinds of insects that were still to be found if
 someone knew how and where to look, and a few roots he had been able to
 identify as edible.
 The further deep inside the mountain range he trod, the stranger and more
 different the life he met became.
 At first the trees started to become bulkier, more water rich, taller and
 greener.
 Then the animals, he noticed, were more stout, fatter, their meat sweet
 and richer in flavor, its color a vivid red, not like the dark, stringy
 meat of the animals he was used to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a sign, he decided, that with every step closer to God's Lands, the
 land was graced by his favor, and the animals were fat and felt no hunger,
 the trees and plants grew tall and proud, the birds soared high and their
 voices were sweet as honey running down a child's mouth.
 It was His work, all that was abundant, and all that was good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part of the mountains seemed to have fallen from His grace, whether
 as another trial, or for reasons only He could entertain.
 No matter, since his wisdom permeates the earth and the sky, he thought
 he could only accept and never wonder, for that way lay madness, and the
 fall from grace into pits of despair and malevolence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt he was attuned, resonating with the earth below, the sky above and
 the stone all around him.
 He reached into his small sack, and with no effort produced a small circular
 pendant, a thin slice of white marble or porcelain cast around a black
 mat surface, smooth and cold to the touch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He held it firmly with both hands for a while, looking intently at its black
 surface and then a thin sliver of green started to pulsate on the black
 surface, a green line starting to form from one edge of the small black
 circlet, and ending on another, to form a straight path, like the invisible
 brush of a painter kept stroking the same line, always in the same direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at the thin, green line of light, and then looked at the faint
 mountain path that zig-zag through the ever rockier slopes.
 His path was true, that much he knew.
 His pointing stone had not failed him before, and neither would it fail
 him now, not on his Pilgrimage, not while his faith was strong, and his
 prayer warm of heart and soul.
 That he knew, and little else would come to matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a moment and gazed at the lands resting below him.
 The great northern plains could be seen far away, a faint gray haze slightly
 discernible under a thin sheet of fog.
 And then rolling hills of auburn slowly lifting off the ground as if the
 very hand of God had touched and pinched the lands, his hand print faintly
 echoed in the timid, graceful slopes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the foot of the mountains and the hills, lay a deep gorge, a wild
 river running through it, twisting and turning as far as the eye could
 see further to the east, its flow coming from somewhere deep inside the
 mountains, further up north, further than the lands where his people roam,
 where the snow never melts and the suns always hide behind the clouds,
 where neither man nor beast can endure for long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fleeting sensation of wonder filled him, for the works of God were magnificent
 to behold, and his Pilgrimage a unique journey of faith, beauty, wonder
 and duty.
 The honor he was blessed with was indeed so great he could have never thought
 it possible, much less aspire to it.
 Nonetheless, he was on a Pilgrimage to the Land of God.
 He was the Pilgrim, the one honored to pay homage to the Land of God and
 the final resting place of their forefathers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To him lay the duty of bringing back a Holy Forge, to pluck one out of the
 very famed Garden of Wonders! His eyes were suddenly lit at the very thought,
 even as his body still dully ached from the many hardships his peregrination
 had knowingly brought upon him and would bring him still.
 But he ignored all that which occluded his mind and he imagined himself,
 standing amidst the Garden of Wonders and quenching his thirst from the
 Unending Spring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would all be more than worthy of the pain, the cold and the rain.
 Just to lay his eyes on the Veiled Gates, he would willingly give his life.
 But he cannot, and will not, until his Pilgrimage is complete, and his
 people have their Holy Forge renewed.
 Oh, the joyous wonders he is yet to behold, not just the earth and the
 rivers and the mountains all wrought in unquestioned wisdom, but the craft
 of God Himself, right in front of his eyes, at the touch of his hand, from
 silver, and stone, and sand that never crumbles, or faints, and never shall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His senses brought him back to the cold reality.
 He still had some good light left, and he should not waste it.
 Every day without a Holy Forge was a harsh day for his people.
 His journey was still many days and nights away from an end.
 Tarrying here in the middle of the mountains, daydreaming like a young
 selfish brat was not at all what any would expect of him, the one so honored.
 His shoulders suddenly felt a bit heavier with so much resting on them:
 the future of his people, the life of the land, the children yet unborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A gust of the mountains cold and wholesome air seemed to have infected him
 with renewed vigor.
 In seconds, he was already steadily climbing up the steep, winding path
 that would take him between the two dominant mountain peaks, and afterwards
 probably on a shallow descend to the Land of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who had gone before him had followed the same path, and had passed
 on word of their travel and their journey.
 What mountains and ridges to pass, which rivers and springs to drink from,
 what strange growths and roots to eat, where to feel safe and sleep unhindered,
 as well as where to keep one eye open and your knife in hand.
 More than a few had perished and left traces of their demise for the next
 ones to follow, and more than a few times the people had almost been extinguish
ed, their last footprint upon the earth carried away by the winds that know
 no sympathy or heed no pledge and care not for the lives of simple men.

But God provides, and always will.

These thoughts occupied his head as he toiled onwards, even though under
 his thick pelted boots his calloused feet could feel every last jut of
 rock and bit of gravel.
 This was him now, this described him wholly.
 He was Pilgrim, meant to walk the earth until he reached the Holy Place,
 and then whether or not he would go back to his people and his previous
 life, that meant nothing.
 When he performed the Rites, the Holy Forge would be with his people.
 And then he could walk back, and live the rest of his days having witnessed
 the glory of God, teach those that would come after him, and if it fate
 would have it so, help the next Pilgrim prepare for his own difficult journey.

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, he thought, I am getting too far ahead in my thinking.
 My journey is still far from over, and yet here I am, feet dead as wood,
 legs heavy like rock, once again on the climb, all I've loved and known
 left behind perhaps forever, and I am let myself be fooled by visions of
 a future yet to unravel, me at its center.

\begin_layout Standard
Selfishness.
 Ego.
 A sign of malignancy, a precursor to evil thoughts and desires, accursed
 manifestations of Them.
 May God watch over his people and lend him strength and clarity of mind
 and purpose.
 To think such thoughts, when God was already pointing to the true path,
 when everything so far had proceeded along according to his divine plan,
 when the auguries had said it was a good time for a Pilgrimage.
 That he was a good man, that he would be a true Pilgrim, one tat God would
 accept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt he had to cleanse himself with birch and water, pay obeisance to
 his God with an offer of personal sacrifice.
 But he was already on his Pilgrimage, what could he do now that would not
 interfere with his holy purpose? He had no inkling yet, but he felt blood
 rushing through his veins, feeling guilty, shameful, almost soiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pushed harder, the slope turning into an almost sheer wall of rock.
 The small, narrow path had degenerated into a granite crevice with pockmarks
 and surfaces of chipped rock that one had to climb with hands as well as
 feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his mind, it mattered little, because he felt like he would grow wings
 if he had to, if the earth was without warning removed from his feet.
 He felt like he would grow gills and scales, and swim the oceans of the
 world if the skies suddenly opened and poured all the water of the world
 and the earth was covered in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He steadily put one hand after the next, hoisting his lithe and supple careworn
 body slowly but surely, every step of the way a small death for Them and
 their venomous influence that seeps into the hearts and minds of the weak-minde
d and unfaithful, spreading over the people of the earth like a rotting
 disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perspiration glistened on his forehead, the small of his back was damp as
 well, every muscle and joint burning from effort and protesting at every
 leap and move.
 But he kept going, his mind focused, his soul shielded and armed, a searing
 force of pure light stabbing through a heart of darkness, a pestilence
 of lies, deceit and wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was fighting Them, even as he climbed, and sweat, and toiled.
 His whole Pilgrimage was a Holy War, he now knew, and this very climb a
 fight.
 Like the War between God and Them, at a time before man.
 The same war, a million fights, a million more, until God prevails, until
 the faithful have had their share of blood, toil, and fighting.
 Until then, he would climb for his people, His Faithful.
 Until then, he would endure the forces arrayed against him, be they nature,
 men, or Them, in one disguise or many.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would endure and he would prevail.
 Not to become a revered one among his folk, not to serve some delusional
 idea of a grandiose self in a small world and an even smaller land, an
 even fewer people.
 It was true, their numbers were dwindling, their women bore less children,
 and their liver were becoming shorter.
 He would endure the hardships of his path and the machinations of the enemies
 of God, for the good of his people and the will of his God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He reached out with one hand blindly, his face wearing an expression of
 determination, a resolute, stout mask under which nerves flickered furiously
 with jabbing explosions of pain and anguish, though for no one else to
 know apart himself and God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He grasped for a handhold in the rock, a fissure, a jutting piece of granite
 or lime, but all he could grasp was thin, cold rushing air.
 With another leap, his face was caught in the stream of air, his hood wildly
 fluttering about his neck, sweaty locks of hair caressing his face.
 He had reached the neck between the two peaks, and he could now see a wide
 stretch of plain-like ground extending before him, grim patches of grass,
 rocks and dusty gravel for days worth of travel ahead of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could feel the touch of God as he took the final step onto the plateau,
 his soul drifted away by a divine wind, his aching body forgetful of his
 aches and trappings.
 He felt light as a feather, in body and soul.
 He remembered then the words of his Guide, his people's master of lore
 and faith, their holy man:

Indeed then his path was true, one of many perils left behind.
 He let out a laugh, in spite of him, a laugh he would look down on with
 contempt as blasphemous, but it was a laugh that welled from the soul,
 a liberating act, a cry of thanks to his God, his protector, his ever watchful
 Father.
 He started walking with a steady slow pace once more, with what little
 light of day remained guiding him to a cluster of rocks where he might
 find shelter for the coming night.
 Once he lay down, he would pray to God and offer him his gratitude for
 saving him from disgrace and keeping him on his true path.

faint aroma of cinnamon and rosebuds permeated the bedroom, a thin, comely

The Ministry Tower rang once, then twice, for the people to wake up timely,
 and offer their daily prayer to the Gods.
 The scurrying feet of water sellers and milk men could be heard from the

Celia woke up as the beam of sunlight characteristically bounced off the
 gleaming, copper-skinned Ministry tower, as was usually the case.
 Her long golden brown hair, tangled as it was from last night's fretful
 sleep, resembled a flaming bush when the copper-tinted light cast off the
 ministry's tower shone upon her.
 Her visage was one of a fiery, avenging god-maiden of fury and destruction,
 an avalanche of wrath rushing down upon the wrongdoers and evil-makers
 that dared incur her retribution.

But that was only a fleeting impression, for when she touched her grown
 belly and felt her unborn child still soundly and safely asleep, her smile
 was like heavenly orchards grew and bore ripe honey-sweet fruit in the
 blink of an eye, all the goodness of creation coming together in a still
 moment of time, a mother's smile, a power beyond reckoning and imagination,
 all that in the creases of a beautiful face and two comely lips.
 And she who had seemed as a terrible force had been wondrously transfigured,
 into a mother bathed in sunlight, radiating warmth and love, any hint of
 terrible awe a mere phantom now in the eye of the beholder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a few moments of silent contemplation, as if communicating with the
 fetus growing inside her, and some moments of simple indulgence in smelling
 the morning fragrances and hearing the first sounds of day, Celia threw
 her sheets away playfully and got out of bed to follow her usual routine:
 she took her morning bath, and then offered her own prayer to the Gods,
 thanking them for sending a man like Amonas to her, thanking them for conceivin

 and her child's first cry into this world.

She was then startlingly taken by the fragrant smell that had gently occupied
 her senses ever since she opened her eyes, and felt almost strange for
 not immediately taking notice of such a beautiful scent.
 With a familiar way, she tried to trace the source of the fragrant smell
 that seemed to seep through the walls and pour from balconies and windows.
 She peered over her stone balcony, more and more people starting to wade
 through the streets, the day starting off in its usual rhythm.

 Who would dare cross arms with the Law? Much less for a little taste of
 sugar.
 And Cerpiem, the stall vendor, who sold almost anything from thin sheets

She knew Amonas would be somewhere here in the city of Pyr, but it was much

Lady Rovenia was dumbstruck at Celia's reaction but she was quick to act
 as well.
 She found a small alcove on Celia's kitchen wall to set the still warm
 bread pan, and then hurried to the drinking bucket, and poured a large
 cup of water for Celia to wash the troubling piece of food down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia, still trying to recover from her attack of hysterical laughter, and
 still coughing, took the proffered cup of water, and drank in large gulps.
 Some of the water ran down her cheeks and neck, some of it she spluttered
 while coughing, but most of it washed the bread-pie down, and she could
 safely breathe again, now laughing because of the way she nearly choked.
 Lady Rovenia seemed terrified, a pale look of worry drawn all over her
 small wrinkled face, but managed to say in a quavering voice full of concern:

And with that they passed the time until the evening arrived, exchanging
 stories and tales, but mostly Rovenia telling her the story of her life
 in many small parts, whatever little story she felt most appropriate at
 any time, whether it be funny, sad, or in some curious circumstances, both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia was drawn to the old woman's tales like a kitten to warm milk.
 At first she sipped them slowly, and then drank them all in as if catering
 for an insatiable desire to listen to everyday tales of an old midwife
 and caring neighbor.
 Celia thought old Rovenia would be quite fitting for the task, and the
 old woman lovingly knocked her door from time to time to check how she
 was doing, if her health was anything less than adamant, and if the baby
 kicked and felt lively enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

She insisted on Celia eating lots of eggs and milk if she could cope with
 it on a daily basis, and drink lots of uwe, said to be good for everything,
 from the blood to the bones.
 And when the child would stir troubled, the best medicine would be to sing
 to it, sing from her heart, whatever soothed and pleased her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the old lady finally left the house, it was more from polite awareness
 of the time that had melted away from the hearty discussion, almost like
 one between an anxious soon-to-be grandmother and her pregnant daughter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia had never known her mother, and her father was killed in the Pacification
 of Zaelin, little enough to understand almost nothing around her, but old
 enough to remember her father kissing her goodbye for the last time, his
 kiss at once somber and warm to the touch.
 She had grown up with her grandparents, who loved her more than possible
 and raised her better than a daughter.
 They had died before they could see her wed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia offered the old lady to stay for the rest of the day, provide her
 valuable insight and experience in cooking the next day's meal, but Rovenia
 said it was unhealthy for the baby to stay inside for long, and that she
 should definitely go on a walk while there was still any sunlight left,
 since nighttime in Pyr was less than a proper place for an expecting woman,
 the light of the lamps leaving more to the shadow than seemed wise and
 proper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, like most ladies at her age, she would retire in the warmth of her small
 house, and pass the time weaving jedoons and other pieces of cloth that
 might come in handy, or not.
 And then she laughed briefly but genuinely, and went next door, leaving
 Celia to tend to her own household in peace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She did just that for some time, idling away at brooming and cleaning the
 house as much as her straining back allowed, and then she brought firewood
 from their small cellar, and paused for a while before starting a fire
 anew for tomorrow's meal, perhaps some stew, perhaps a broth of beans and
 greens, a recipe Rovenia had suggested while they were idly gnawing at
 her bread-pie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She stood with a few small pieces of firewood cupped into her arms, when
 the thought flashed in her head unwanted: she was out of uwe, again! She
 left the tiny logs aside on the small kitchen table and went upstairs to
 fetch her small purse of coins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She then made sure she hadn't actually started off an untended fire, drew
 her broadly-hemmed cloak around her and darted off towards the market,
 light waning, the falling dusk painting the distant encircling hills in
 an orange and purple hue, some of the rooftops in Pyr shedding a brown-yellow
 sheen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The city crowd on the streets was shifting towards its nocturnal aspect,
 the ones that rarely venture outside if the suns still abound, and rarely
 crawl back to their domiciles before dawn is about to break.
 Loud song and cheers, sounds of merrymaking and laughter could be heard
 at least once in every street that she passed on her way to Ves, the farmer
 she knew was her kin, a cousin in fact, and tried not to fool her like
 others in the market did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She wasn't sure if she would make it in time, for at this hour Ves as well
 as almost everyone else with farms or animals to tend, had to leave for
 his farmstead, eat and rest, before getting up in the middle of the night,
 watering whatever plants needed so, then harvesting those ready for the
 market, and then loading up his cart and off he would be to the market
 once more to make some coin, for his wife and children not to beg like
 some who were cast adrift in the unfathomable torrents of fortune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She could see them, disheveled beings, sometimes indistinguishable from
 animals, sometimes bringing a sore tear to her eyes.
 Some she helped as she could, a loaf of bread or her daily bottle of milk.
 Sometimes she would leave a plate of food for those that drifted throughout
 the city and did not just await their end at some dark corner of the market,
 either stamped upon, trodden by mistake or not, sometimes hunted as a pastime
 by men drunk enough or too clearheaded to care as they ended their horrid
 lives, bringing on a fate only fit for nightmares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she turned the last corner before she reached Ves' usual stand, she could
 see she was too late, Ves as well as everyone else having departed for
 the night, leftover fruit and vegetable stalks amassing on the cobbled
 streets, a sour acrid odor wafting all around her.
 If nothing else at all, she had indeed taken a walk, though at an inappropriate
 hour, and she should be getting home before long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she turned around to start walking back towards her house, she was frozen
 where she lay, when a mailed hand seemed to stretch from utterly nowhere,
 some shadowy crevice, some chasm in a wall she hadn't noticed in her dimly
 lit surroundings, a surreptitious figure that seemed well-disposed towards
 her, or else she would be already lying in a pool of her blood, for what
 little coin she carried in her tiny purse, or things worse than an untimely
 death that she dared not imagine while carrying her child still in her
 womb.

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was picking ineffectually at the withering bark of a large oak-like
 tree, swarms of ants running up and down its length, tiny flecks of dead
 wood on their backs.
 The tree was turning into ashes, returning into the dirt, one very small
 piece at a time.
 Hilderich was quite fascinated by what he was seeing all around him and
 that was probably why he had not broken down in hysterical cries because
 of their mishap.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which was also why he could blame Amonas for their predicament, in a steady,
 calm, matter-of-factly and somewhat detached, distant tone of voice.
 Half his mind was infuriated, close to bursting actually, because Amonas
 seemed to have had inadvertently stranded them on 
\shape slanted
somewhere.
 
\shape default
The other half of his mind was trying to make connections between the flora
 and fauna of this general area, place, whatever one might call it, and
 the various curatoria he believed he remembered having some kind of relation
 in part or in whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indirectly, this was Hilderich's way of coping with the problem in hand,
 partly to offset his mind and unburden it from stress, anxiety, and generally
 what he had learned to consider counter-productive emotions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on top of that, he was actually trying to help in his own lateral way,
 by trying to identify anything he might be able to, based on whatever curatoria
 he had studied or seen in his unfortunately short and, recent events not
 withstanding, uneventful apprenticeship.
 It seemed that apart from superficial resemblances and some generic common
 traits, he had arrived at no particularly useful conclusion.
 For the time being, he reminded himself silently and thoughtfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was sitting at a partly exposed root of a gigantic kind of a tree
 he had trouble accepting that was real, even though he had been sitting
 right there, on the same spot, for the better part of an hour, silent,
 thoughtful and certainly perplexed, even though Hilderich had spared little
 of the last hour discussing with Amonas, or simply looking at the man's
 face, which would be enough for the even the most socially inept, slow-witted
 and sentimentally detached human to understand the man was deeply troubled,
 almost morose, and not without good cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insects abounded in this humid environment, the likes of which he had not
 known existed, not even in the southern-most bogs and marshes.
 Sweat poured from their bodies incessantly, making their every movement
 a sticky, messy business.
 It was the heat.
 The heat of desert combined with the water, the moisture, of a lake or
 river.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had seen no river whatsoever from the top of the hill where they had
 emerged, and had come upon no body of water in their blind search so far.
 The humidity and heat of the place was overwhelming; Amonas thought they
 should devote most of their time and effort into simply staying alive for
 the time being.
 That meant finding a source of clean, fresh water, preferably by nightfall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' mind buzzed incessantly with the same thought; it was indeed his
 fault.
 Hilderich had been right.
 His initial purpose when pushing Hilderich into that infernal pillar of
 light, that machinery truly in its makers image, was to force him to see
 the truth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time he himself had stepped through that beacon of light, he had
 been instantly transferred into a huge, deep cavern, walls of solid metal

 constructs the likes of which he could not believe were made by mere men,

He had seen words in High Helican he had not seen before, dangling in the

\begin_layout Standard
He had seen so much more he needed to forget as well, but could not, in
 fact, dared not forget, lest the hatred for their jailers, captors, these

 it was still raging as blistering as ever.

 about like a sickle does unto stalks of wheat.
 
\end_layout

No such euphemism of words like dictator, or killer, would really suffice

Without knowing, he seemed to have been gripping his knife from its blade,
 so intensely he had cut himself, a small rivulet of blood and sweat running
 down his wrist, droplets of rosy red falling down onto the constantly wet
 ground.
 Ever thirsty and never quenched, be it blood, water or both, these new
 lands seemed to feed on desperation and sweat.
 His focus returned to the immediate reality around them and felt the sagging
 weight of the situation.

He had to have faith in himself: he was a man of action, and he had already

He looked up to the alien looking sky, so familiar but so different at the
 same time.
 He could remember his days of ignorance and blissful youth, riding in the
 countryside, galloping fast and hard as if the world's end was rushing
 right behind him.
 And the sky had this strange quality, a light blur, a haze of wonder, looking
 as if it was a mere ceiling he could reach up and touch as long as he wished
 it hard enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would not perish here, he decided.
 It was as simple as that.
 He would keep his promises and find his way back, to make things right.
 To free his fellow men.
 To live life anew, reborn.
 As fresh and innocent as his firstborn would be.
 It was time to act, secure any means of survival in this strange land,
 acclimatise themselves quickly, for who knew how long their journey back
 would take, and have faith, in themselves, and their purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be Hilderich's now as well, even though he cannot yet grasp the
 extend of the lies, deceit, and exploitation.
 He should be able to put Hilderich to some good use as well; the man who
 was a little older than a mere boy had good qualities.
 He was smart and perceptive, suspicious but not predisposed, simple but
 not simple-minded.
 He would be fine.
 They would be fine.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suns were wrong, for starters.
 There was only one sun here, and it seemed brighter than usual, but smaller,
 the hue of its light an almost lime green.
 And then there were the towers, or spirals, he wasn't sure how to describe
 them.
 Hideously tall and thin towers in pairs, a low crescent shape adjoining
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They kind of reminded him of bull horns, if he had to describe them more
 plainly.
 Far away in the distance, were the haze allowed it, they could make out
 not one of these monumentally proportioned constructs, but a dozen or more,
 in regular intervals.
 They were fascinating, but largely irrelevant at this point.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had thought about broaching these matters to Hilderich, but he decided
 against that for now.
 The detailed intricacies of their whereabouts, their actual location, the
 climate and topography of the region, were merely academic issues if they
 would not provide a small shred of actual information that would lead them
 to somehow going back to Pyr, or any recognizable place for that matter,
 in the Territories or elsewhere in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was still absorbed in thought, eyes piercing the tall canopy of thick
 foliage, the huge volume of the surrounding trees standing like rocky pillars

 their return, and the other, the heavenly shell of a world that they were
 yet to reach, the world back home, their haven.

Hilderich was shouting now, still thinking Amonas was day-dreaming or far

 As he swung his hand back once more to deliver another slap, Amonas turned

 said:

Hilderich was genuinely surprised at such behavior.
 Had Amonas been catatonic, he would never really respond and then he would
 be left alone, and with his survival skills and his latest round of luck,
 perish in this steamy cauldron.
 If he was indeed mad, he probably go berserk and snap his neck like a twig
 if he was lucky enough.
 It seemed now that he was neither.
 He was simply, as strange as it seemed to Hilderich at the time, hard at

He sat down in front of Amonas, on the leaf strewn ground, wet and muddy,
 a continuous hint of rotting vegetation waxing and waning from the faint
 wisps of air, a fitting reminder of what happens to idle life.
 Hilderich cleared his throat and while still looking at the ground, toying
 around with a small branch, idly looking at the ground, he asked with some
 reluctance:

Amonas.
 This is real, right? This is not a trick, not some very elaborate way of

Amonas bit his lip and answered, palms outstretched, an ornate ring of silver

 He seemed to draw some breath, then pausing briefly as if he intended to
 say otherwise before nodding in acceptance and telling Hilderich:

It's real Hilderich.
 That is what has dragged me down in thought.
 I am sorry Hilderich, my intentions were quite different, and certainly
 did not involve getting utterly lost, especially at such a moment in time.
 I know I have failed you so far Hilderich, so I will promise you nothing.
 I can only offer you my help in order to find a way home.
 Preferably, while we still draw breath.

 at the thick foliage, hoping to catch a glimpse of the strangely immaculate,
 perfectly cloudless sky.

\begin_layout Standard
When Amonas looked down again, he noticed Hilderich had fallen on his back
 giggling almost maniacally, his knees bent haplessly in a comical angle,
 arms folded across his chest, hands clapping with the whole of his palms.
 Amonas frowned quizzically, Hilderich's bizarre reaction to his statement
 leaving him unable to understand or much less respond at all.

Hilderich sat upright, legs sprawled in an uncomfortable position, his hand
 pointing at his own face in sheer disbelief, his voice a falsetto.
 His face looked suddenly harsh, unforgiving, out of place with his normal
 self, and then he raised an accusing finger at Amonas, saying to him in
 a calm and studied manner, as if lecturing a man of lesser intelligence:
\end_layout

Not to insinuate that you have done a very poor job so far, but please,
 indulge me.
 How can you, help me, find a way home.
 Are you perhaps a magician of the old tales? I think not dear friend, since
 then you would be in possession of a cone-shaped hat, talking gibberish
 even while you sleep, though I cannot yet vouch for the verity or not of
 that particular supposition.
 Another possible way in which you might be of help would be that you are,
 in fact, a fallen angel of the Gods, who has yet to use his superlative
 powers in my favor because he is as ever trying to teach me a lesson in
 humility and religious awe, lest my soul is eternally condemned in Catharteria,
 Damnation, the Twelve Wheels of Fire and so on.
 You seem to be missing your wings, shield, divine aura, and angelic face,
 so I would say no, you can't help me like that.
 I briefly considered that you might actually own this particular piece
 of land and are indeed

 humidity, unbearable heat and overflowing vegetation for marshlands suitable
 for cotton, or something equally senile.
 Without trying to hurt your feelings or vested interests in a manner most
 ungracious, I regret to inform you I find your selling points lacking and
 will not be following up on your offer.
 Now, unless I am mistaken in all of the above, and unless you have some
 button or pillar of light that does the opposite of what brought us here,
 I dare say we are properly doomed, and good as dead and finished.
 Other more vulgar expressions pertaining to our present unfortunate situation
 come to mind, but I will not bring myself down to such inestimable depths
 of bad taste and linguistic ineptitude to use them like a debased wretch
 of lesser stature.
 I will now honestly state my predilections, one, that I wish to hang myself
 at the nearest opportune moment in order to escape further unneeded physical
 torment under these circumstances, and two, that I wish for my remains
 to be burned, as is customary under Law.

All that Amonas could do, was blink, wide-eyed and at a loss for words.
 Hilderich was resting his hands on his knees, cross-legged on the wet ground,
 an air of finality around him, as if a holy avatar had announced the end
 of the world.
\end_layout

Amonas shattered the uneasy silence with a question, uttered in complete

Hilderich, I'm sure we'll have quite some time to exchange more tales.
 But we have to attend to our survival first.
 We will need fresh, drinking water.
 And something solid to eat, surely.
 Something that will not easily spoil in this heat and moisture, this unlikely
 combination of marsh and forest.
 But our priority should be water.
 At the rate we sweat, we will surely suffer the most from its lack.
 And too soon for comfort, I would wager.
 Speaking of which, have you noticed? The shadows, they are strange.

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded, then looked carefully around them, at the barks of trees
 and small rocks and hanging green overgrowths.
 He looked at what one would call a glen if it weren't for the awfully wrong
 conditions and the green overarching roof made from ostensibly ancient
 tree branches.
 The canopy was a mosaic of green and brown hues, the greenish light of
 the sun adding an emerald glare to the columns of light that shot underneath,
 where Hilderich could see, the shadows stood still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, he noticed that the shadows had moved little or not at all since
 earlier.
 He couldn't be sure, but he knew it was at least strange, and probably
 another indication that they were very, very, far away from home.
 He pointed at a broken log with his right hand, a tall outstretched branch
 casting its shadow on a peculiar half-gray, half-bleached stone.

After little deliberation Amonas answered casually:

I would say about noon.
 But I could be mistaken.
 A few hours ago, before we reached this place, night was well under way.
 And then when we came here, it seemed like a bright summer day, the sun
 still rising proudly.
 My body and mind long for rest, my sense of time should be in disarray.
 But if I woke up right this instant, I would've thought I overslept into
 noon.

Amonas frowned, but did not press the issue.
 Instead, he nodded in silent agreement, then said with a careful choice

The shadows during the day are cast because of the suns' light.
 So, when the suns move across the sky, so do the shadows follow in hand
 and move accordingly.
 Would the suns stay still, so would the shadows.
 It is not entirely without logic to postulate that since we have witnessed
 only one sun, this is perhaps the reason for its inability to move, and
 hence the standing shadows and the continuous moon.
 There it is, a much more simple explanation which, as my late master would
 have said, is usually the right one.

If that comes to be, then the heat will not dissipate, and this will go

 Or then again we might never leave this place.

Hilderich was seemingly more humorous than before, and his words were not
 to be taken for granted, but Amonas had to admit to the fact that this
 strange sun and taxing climate would make their efforts even more strained
 and difficult that he had calculated.
 And still he feared, they had no solid idea of how to get back home.
 Survival would have to take precedence.
 And that meant finding water, not sooner or later, but immediately.

Under different circumstances that would involve my absence, I would be

 imperceptibly condescending sort of nod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few hours passed, Amonas grinding their way through ever thicker vegetation,
 now stripped naked to the waist, the heat and humidity insufferable to
 bear with his leather vest and chain mail underneath that.
 Hilderich wondered at how the man had suffered to carry all that weight
 at all, never mind wearing all that in such conditions, and only choosing
 not to when after they had been walking for the better part of an hour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed as if the man had grown literally attached to his set of armor,
 or that its prolonged use had left indelible stains on his body.
 None of those reasons, it seemed, stood to reason.
 Amonas had simply not taken them off because he hadn't felt inclined to.
 That probably spoke volumes for the man's tolerance threshold, and what
 he was capable of going through if pressed, but Hilderich thought he had
 no desire to learn, since he believed this whole experience would be if
 nothing else, extremely educational and vividly remembered if there was
 any afterwards to be had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas seemed to indefatigable.
 He had trod on through thickset lush overgrowths, greens and all sorts
 of wild vegetation using his indispensable knife, and had complained neither
 for the steaming heat or the breath-clogging moisture.
 Hilderich had refrained from asking questions about the reasoning behind
 their apparently random course through this probably impossible to map
 land, lacking great physical characteristics easily identifiable, used
 as points of reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except those twin towers, or bull horns, or giant forks or whatever one
 might wish to call them.
 The name would be indeed useless once one laid eyes upon them.
 Such majestic structures, in the middle of this chaotic spread of plants

 They were roughly headed towards the general direction of one of those
 structures.
 Structures that mere men could not have wrought, but would have had if
 they could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich felt Amonas was not unreasonably excited about his finding, but
 he could not readily share the joy.
 His feet though he did not complain were hurting, and his feet were a soggy
 affair, not the least bit dry.
 His light boots had let all the moisture in, and their path had guided
 him through many mud-soaked footings.
 He could feel his skin was not up to the task, and he looked miserable
 to the bone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, finding water was the first good thing that had happened ever since
 that fine uwe stew, and that previous day seemed like another age altogether.
 He managed a defiant smile which he hoped Amonas would not misunderstand,
 and carried himself to the small trickling water source where Amonas was
 washing his face.

Finally then.
 My mouth feels like a Ministry's rug, like everyone's trod on it!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 water running down through an old tree's bark, like someone had fashioned
 it specifically for that purpose.
 Luck it would seem, hadn't run dry just yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After they had managed to wash away some of the sweat and grit, and more
 importantly, quench their thirst and fill their belly with more than water
 than it could handle, Amonas took Hilderich by the arm and suggested to
 him that they should try and make some sort of camp here, near the water.
 The rain would be coming, he said, even with the sun above, since there
 can be no water with no rain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they would have to keep dry, since that was how many folk in the sea
 died, their bodies found almost dried out, dessicated, husks rather than
 flesh.
 It was because water was attracted to water, and the water in the body,
 the blood, the piss, the spit, all that water was drawn away, to the river,
 or sea, or whatever larger body of water you happened to be in.
 The rich got richer, even in nature, perhaps even in this weird land as
 well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, Amonas had convinced Hilderich that it was wiser to stay dry,
 and it would be indeed a welcome change in any case.
 They would have to build a fire to do that, and with all that humidity
 everywhere, he could not for the life of him figure out how, but they had
 found water, so they would build a fire too.
 Or so Amonas said.
 He was very convincing, Hilderich reassured himself before feeling unmistakably
 hungry, his stomach sounding like a cauldron on fire with nothing inside
 the broth but water.

I haven't seen a breathing thing yet, only biting insects and that's no

 Besides, it wouldn't be worth it.
 No real river or stream to try and find fish.
 We'll have to rely on you then, Hilderich.
 Try and find some kind of root, stem or plant in general you think might
 be safe to eat.
 I don't mean taste good, Hilderich.
 I really mean, eating it won't kill us, not right off anyway.
 I know I can leave you to it while I gather what wood and fiber I can manage
 to start working on that small tent of ours.
 Have faith in yourself Hilderich, we'll get back.

 inclined more rather than ordered and pushed around.
 It was the voice of a leader, Hilderich realized, a man fit for the task
 at hand: keeping people basically alive.

Hilderich nodded, accepting the task though as with most tasks, not knowing

Amonas went about making a make-shift tent, and Hilderich finding something
 edible.
 Within less than half an hour, Amonas had laid down a few logs, half rotten
 and half dead, but good enough for the job in hand.
 He had stacked them so as to make a simple crude roof, and then covered
 that simple skeleton with snapped off fresh branches and twigs, and overlaid
 huge thick leaves from the innumerable plants available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He hoped these would suffice, and once he had massed enough pieces of wet
 yet not soggy wood, he piled it down neatly in a fire stack, wishing his
 flint and stone would be enough to get the fire going.
 He called out to Hilderich, to check if he had found anything.
 While he received no reply for a few moments, the moment he started to
 feel worried about his whereabouts, Hilderich popped out of a cluster of
 bushes, with what seemed an armful of fine large mushrooms.

 for a good place to leave his priceless armful of mushrooms, but displeased
 with all available options decided to just stand there, a load of mushrooms
 twice the size of his fists carried on his arms.

Amonas smiled, greatly pleased and mildly surprised, both for their luck

 suns seemed to have risen earlier on that day, or at least the Castigator's
 people definitely had.
 At every level of office and hierarchy, the living mechanisms of the Ministry,
 the Army and the Procrastinators were of singular mind and purpose.
 The Castigator had announced that in two weeks time the wrathful military
 might of the Outer Territories would be ready to march for war.
 Something that had not happened in the past 25 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In every single office and chamber of the various organizations of people
 and ruling institutions, the situation was almost the same, if one would
 take into account the multitude of minor variations in disciplinary strictness,
 interpersonal roles and affiliations, as well as structural differences
 and the specific nomenclature of each branch of service.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lesser officials busied themselves with arranging communiques, writing down
 orders and manifests, then calling for couriers or perhaps taking it upon
 themselves to forward the appropriate documents and even matériel to their
 intended recipients.
 It would be anathema to any one in that overwhelmingly complex machine
 of sorts that he should singularly fail in the most simple of orders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If anything were to happen to this whole enterprise, this majestic war footing,
 this Holy Campaign, issued by the Gods, commanded by the Castigator himself,
 then it would not be because a lowly clerk or young lieutenant forgot to
 sent out some matériel requisition form, or a call-to-arms teller.
 And indeed, if this Campaign was to fail because of a human error, in such
 a catastrophic way, before it even began to put itself into motion, everyone
 performed beyond their absolute best to ensure that it would not be on
 their account, on their watch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diligence was considered a virtuous characteristic, and most Law-abiding
 parents tried to hammer that into their children if they had to, so as
 to become proper people, upholding the Law whenever they could, serving
 from any place in society they might reach up to.
 Those that the Gods seemed to favor most, were selected to enter public
 service, either as Ministers, Procrastinators, or Army men, according to
 how well they performed at the Agogeia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select officials from these three embodiments of rule and order taught at
 the Agogeia, schools for those that could afford to become something useful
 in their lives.
 Once the basics such as obedience to Law, reciting scripture, and fairly
 simple counting and sword-fighting skills were taught, the best of each
 class of children were selected according to the inclination, receptiveness,
 and skill they showed at the various tests and games carried out for the
 very same purpose of separating the wheat from the chaff, those capable
 of serving the people and the Gods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some, those better skilled in memory, oration, the use of language and emotion,
 capable of swaying their fellow students to their own purpose, were further
 trained to become Ministers, further trained into the teachings and trappings
 of Law, how to best interpret Law according to need, how to teach, enlighten,
 and chastise laymen, and how to impress and guide hundreds if not thousands
 of people as Law, Ministry, and Ruling Council dictated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They would be responsible for the enlightenment of the people, teaching
 them the Law, and helping them avoid the temptations that would lead to
 blasphemy, heresy, casting out, eternal damnation, and a most probably
 gruesome, demeaning execution that would serve as a reminder and a lesson
 that All is Law, and no one and nothing is above it.
 The Ministers would also tend to the daily running of the Territories,
 as administrative officials, collecting offerings, making amendments to
 the lesser decrees of the Law to better handle the multitude of people
 and the realities of land of the living required, with its economy, trade,
 and needs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spending of coin for public works would be decided and then dispersed
 accordingly to those noble houses that could field enough manpower to make
 it happen, like roads, bridges, canals, buildings, walls, mills and workshops
 and every other resource that would the Territories grow and prosper, for
 the glory of the Pantheon.
 And one of their number would be chosen from the Castigator, with the blessings
 of the Patriarch, to be the next Arch-minister, the one blessed to be the
 voice and heart of the Ministry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those of the Agogeia students who were energetic, athletic students, showing
 exceptional stamina and strength, exemplifying martial prowess with the
 blade and their bare hands, those who were blessed with possessing a sharp
 decisive mind, had proven to be of faith unfailing and a stone hard dedication
 to the Pantheon, those were chosen as fit for service in the Army.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rigorous training in all the known aspects of warfare was their only occupation
 until death, whether or not they were called upon to act, kill or be killed
 in service to the Gods, they would train with sword and spear, shield and
 horse, until old age came, when they would carry on with training others
 of their kind, in matters such as the planning and design of warfare where
 a mind should be much more fit than the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their training started with single combat techniques, with many different
 weapons, under different situations and varying levels of duress.
 Then they progressed into squad tactics, in the open field, against other
 types of units, like cavalry, or steamers and artillery.
 And then they would rotate into the rest of the units, for their training
 to be complete and be able to use everything from their empty hands to
 a complex steamer machine, and be knowledgeable in the weakness and strength
 of each one, being able to select the best course of action and what kind
 of men, machine or animal it would require to be successful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These were the core lessons they were taught: strength in knowledge, success
 in adaptability, glory in death.
 As they progressed through the standings of the Army, always according
 to their merit and degree of success in their duties, always keeping in
 mind their faithful devotion, through their accrued experience they learned
 more about handling men, matériel, and equipment, organization, designing
 and planning with tens of thousands in mind, as one day they might be called
 upon to lead the whole Army as Generals, in the name of the Pantheon first,
 and the Castigator second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those that did not excel in anything, but showed average skill at wielding
 a sword, and could learn enough of the Law as needed orally, those did
 not learn to read and write like the Minister's did, nor train further
 in order to excel into combat.
 These children were strictly chosen for their ability to follow the letter
 of the Law, blindly, unerringly, keep a watchful eye for signs of heresy
 and insubordination, any element that was an affront the Pantheon, and
 the Law, anything that defied the Law or its upholders in spirit or in
 letter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These were the ever watchful eye of the Castigator, the arm that made the
 Law reach into every heart, body, and mind, the Procrastinators.
 Their training was simple, crude, and effective, hammering into them the
 utmost loyalty unto the Law, as well as teaching them how to use people
 in order to learn all that there is, all that is going on, the rumors,
 the happenings, the weddings and deaths, births and oath-takings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything that went on not just in Pyr, but everywhere in the Territories,
 they had to know.
 And if the need arose, they disciplined, re-enlightened, or fetch to the
 Ministers those they deemed suspicious or genuinely guilty of sin.
 And then they enforced the Law and the divine will of the Ministry, unflinching
, following the credo that All is Law.
 And if they performed impeccably, surely they would have the honor of becoming
 Procrastinator Militant, part of the Ruling Council, the left hand of the
 Castigator himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a structure that had been handed down from the Gods themselves, so
 its purpose and form were Holy, and any talk of reform, change, or deviation
 from the established was treated at best as blasphemy, but usually as expressin
g heresy, and was treated accordingly by public torture and death.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None were exempt from such punishment, especially the men in the Ruling
 Council, who were the paragon of Law itself to all the people.
 Such a hideous concept was not unknown, that a man in the Ruling Council
 would denounce the Gods by committing or speaking heresy, for it happened
 long before, in a past almost rightly forgotten and excised from the Annals
 of the Territories, but still lingering in peoples' memory as Shan's Betrayal,
 a myth to frighten the children into obeying, a fable to instruct and put
 the fear of the Gods into the soul of men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shan had been a General of the Army, at a time when the Territories had
 not grown past the lands around Pyr.
 When the Ruling Council decided it was time to enlighten the nearby shores
 of Urfall, Shan was reluctant, at first.
 The story says he was publicly chastised, with a hundred lashes to his
 body edging him close to death.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because he was deemed an exceptional strategist and a peerless tactician,
 he was once more asked to lead the armies that would enlighten Urfall,
 instead of being stripped of office and rank and live on the streets as
 a beggar, given the opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of the Pantheon,
 the people and the Castigator.
 He acceded, and the armies marched off, gleaming in their metal armor,
 the blessings of the Castigator sung over the Southern Gates of Pyr.
 Within a few weeks, Shan's armies seemed lost, no message of the war reaching
 Pyr, and no messengers from Pyr ever returning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, Shan appeared over the hills encircling Pyr, and had with him not
 only the armies he had marched off with weeks before, but horses, and men
 and catapults and hellish contraptions that spurted fire and death, from
 Urfall.
 He had spread the heresy to the armies like the mythic whores of old spread
 disease, like the cancer that spreads from the roots of a tree to its leaves
 and brings about its death.
 And he had the Urfalli with him, their machines working in unfathomable
 ways, the products of heretical pacts with the forces of evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He reached the Gates of Pyr and demanded the surrender first and foremost
 of the Ruling Council, and had the ineffable audacity to accuse the Council
 of lies and crimes to the people, twisting the word of the Law and spewing
 horrific untruths.
 It was an attempt to poison the minds of everyone in the city as well,
 promising that none of those who surrendered willingly would be hurt in
 any way, and a fair trial would be arranged for all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for the Council, who would be executed after their supposed lies
 had been exposed and their non-existent crimes against men proved unquestionabl
y.
 Such heretic lies had never been uttered or thought of before, and never
 would again, their venomous treachery so base, the Castigator himself is
 said to have cried in desperation, for he had never thought a dearly loved
 brother like Shan would fall from grace like that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The city was utterly defenseless, save but a few procrastinators and old
 army tutors, and lowly farmers, herders, artisans and traders that had
 not yielded shield, spear or sword not once in their lives.
 The armies of Shan had cast away all form of decency, form or honor, and
 turning into a heretic rabble, had begun to scour the lands, pillaging,
 raping, and burning, before what they thought would be the grand feast
 of Pyr itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they never managed to sink their putrid claws and teeth into the immaculate
 flesh of the City of Pyr, for it was protected by the Gods, as are all
 their faithful and humble servants.
 For when the time was nigh, and all seemed lost, the Castigator Hanul Ofodor
 the 1st, retired from the halls of the Disciplinarium, and went deep into
 the Sacred Vaults, where he and the Patriarch offered their blood to commune
 with the Gods, and ask for deliverance in that time of need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a day and a night, while the heretic hordes of Shan looted and pillaged,
 and while the outer walls of Pyr were about to fall, an angel sent from
 the Gods appeared in their image, casting brilliant rays of cleansing light,
 and annihilating the armies of Shan who had no other recourse but to flee
 like the vermin they were.
 None escaped the angel's wrath, who spread the cleansing fire to every
 last part of Shan's army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Day of Redemption had passed, the City of Urfall and its majestic
 harbor and proud workshops were all extinguished in a ball of light so
 pure in its wrath that those who saw it with bare eyes went blind, and
 would forever be praised in their lives as Martyrs of the Wrath of the
 Gods, spreading the tale of Shan and what they saw to everywhere they went.
 And such was the way the story was told, from one generation to the next,
 as a reminder, even though the official Annals never admitted or recorded
 it, for as much as it mattered, it should never have happened in the eyes
 of the Gods, and so it never had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And such was the tale of Shan Lagus, the Betrayer, proscribed from history,
 but alive in the memory of Law-fearing people, people like the Arch-minister
 LaVasse, a wide, big-boned man, dressed in an opulent surplice, holy texts
 in High Helican weaved around the sleeves, a Seal of Office hanging round
 his neck in a pendant made of platinum and emeralds, fittingly pure and
 clean to represent the qualities of the Arch-minister.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was presently at the Strategium Proper, in the company of the General
 of the Army, and the Procrastinator Militant, whose embarrassing near-blunder
 at last night's festivities at the announcement of the Last Holy Campaign
 as it was officially now named, had not gone unnoticed, and had become
 the subject of sarcastic comments and irony even at lower echelons of Ministry
 and Army, but had only naturally been ignored by the Procrastinators as
 a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General of the Army had not been present at the event due to having
 received news of the Castigator's decision from beforehand, and had indeed
 spent the night hard at work putting his most trusted and capable people
 together, rousing them up from their sleep in order to lay down the priorities
 of planning and start orchestrating the massive preparations involved in
 such an endeavor as a Holy Campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had of course learned of the Procrastinator's Militant blunder, and even
 though second hand accounts rarely manage to do justice, he had exchanged
 knowing looks and smiles with the Arch-minister that had gone largely unnoticed
 by the Procrastinator Militant, a somewhat alarming fact if one would care
 to extrapolate the level of the Procastinators' vigilance from the qualities
 apparent in its most senior member.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three of them had been there from before dawn, the Arch-minister and
 Procrastinator Militant arriving together though having rode in separate
 coaches, having left from the Disciplinarium once proper etiquette was
 adhered to and the reenactment of the Pacification of Zaelin thoroughly
 reenacted, with bloodletting and prayer ensuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were now sipping fresh hot uwe tea, comfortably seated at the General's
 planning chamber, all sorts of charts and maps laid out over a grand table,
 heaps reports and still unsigned orders heaped upon the General's desk,
 a utilitarian piece of furniture, like most around the chamber, sturdy
 and well-made but otherwise unadorned and plain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Arch-minister was seated on the only luxurious chair available, plush
 velvet adorning the back and the sitting surface, elegantly inlaid pieces
 of ivory, black granite and tether-wood intertwined in flowing designs
 in the stylish armrests.
 The Procrastinator Militant sat at a simple stool, much more accommodating
 for a soldier in search of a few moments of resting one's legs during brief
 pauses in a battle, rather than a man of such a high office as a Procrastinator
 Militant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General had briefly apologized to the Procrastinator Militant for lack
 of a better seating apparatus, and explained that any and all equipment
 deemed to be of an extraneous nature was being dismantled to be put into
 other uses now that the preparations for the campaign demanded every last
 bit of usable material.
 And that even included artisan chairs made of young sycamore and inlaid
 with ivory, granite, and tether-wood, not unlike the last one available
 for seating persons of importance, of which the Arch-minister seemed to
 make such good use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not that he implied at any point, the General continued, that the Procrastinator
 Militant was not a person of incalculable importance, but alas, the Arch-minist
er had seniority according to the Law of Founding, so it was Law that essentiall
y demanded that the Arch-minister be seated in the proper way, while he
 would have to make do with what little was available at such a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that, the Procrastinator Militant withdrew from any thought or intention
 of protesting, and simply accepted the proffered stool graciously.
 By looking at the Arch-minister, if one didn't know better he might misinterpre
t his slight grin as an indication of silent enjoyment of the unfortunate
 predestinations of the Procrastinator on his behalf, but such a man was
 beyond such base thoughts, and was merely grinning at the studious labor
 going on around the Strategium Proper, praising the high spirits of everyone
 involved, and personally congratulating the General of the Army for kicking
 off the preparations in the way expected:

I am more than honored, indeed blessed, to hear such praise from your Excellence.
 Yes, they are most valuable, as well as tether-wood and the sycamore.
 From what I know of the artisan's techniques, the ivory is used in delicate
 steamer parts without which the damnable things would blow up before going
 ten feet.
 The sycamore and tether-wood are used in constructing siege engines, and
 the granite is turned into pellets for the steamers' slingshots.

 I believe that in such an important time, we should dispense with tiring
 mannerisms of protocol and etiquette, and get on with the business in hand,
 to better serve Law and the glory of the Pantheon, of course.

 was his peer, which was strictly speaking, false.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge was visibly but also pleasantly surprised, his look widened and
 his face brightened up a tone.
 Gomermont seemed to fidget uncomfortably at his stool, unable to arrange
 his body in a manner both sufficient and comely of a Procrastinator Militant.
\end_layout

 replied in kind to the Arch-minister:

Oh, make no mistake Tyrpledge, my rank, office, and related trappings of
 my status as Arch-minister still hold and I expect you to diligently administer
 the proper respect.
 At least in public, when we are not planning together, exchanging information
 and agreeing to our next best course of action.
 Be reminded of course, that the Castigator is always briefed on our meetings
 and though we have been given executive control of the Holy Campaign, whatever
 course of action we decide on, has to be ratified by His Piousness.
 In grave matters of battle that is, since currently I have been empowered
 with freedom to act as the Castigator's proxy in these preliminary stages
 of the preparation.

\begin_layout Standard
La Vasse's voice assumed a harsher tone, the weight in his voice and words
 punctuating his heightened status of authority.
 His strict but fair tone was indicative of his intentions: He would be
 reasonably cooperative and would dispense of the pleasantries and honors
 where applicable, but that would not bring Tyrpledge up to the same level
 as him, the proxy of the Castigator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He also seemed to limit this dispensation to Tyrpledge alone, since Gomermont
 apart from being a relatively useless dolt, the most common type of Procrastina
tor, his office also was not immediately pertinent to the Campaign, since
 he and his men would remain in the cities and towns, ever watchful of signs
 of insurrection and heresy when the Castigator and much of the governing
 mechanism would be in the Widelands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge was simply a soldier, a sword to be wielded like a tool, bending
 to the master's will.
 He had never had any misconceptions of his status, and the Arch-minister's
 words carried no different message: he would still be following orders
 diligently and respectfully, he just didn't have to stand at attention
 the whole time.
\end_layout

Once La Vasse's words settled in, Tyrpledge said in a simple, straightforward
 manner and a genuine voice of calm acceptance:

 And how do you fit the horses inside that? How do they breathe, is it through
 those pipes? I'm quite curious.

General Tyrpledge rolled his eyes in an almost shocking expression of unadultera

The are called steamers, because they use steam, which is very hot water.
 They do not use horses.
 They are not polished because if they were, they would give away their

La Vasse, I need to know.
 You are closer to the Castigator, his proxy, probably the only reliable

 The Widelands are wild lands, there are no people living there.
 Sane people, at least.
 No cities, or towns, or anything to capture, and maintain.
 With no population to enlighten, no forces arrayed against us, what objectives
 should I designate? What provisions will I require? What manner of equipment,
 what disposition of forces? How will our forces move? What, exactly, will
 we be attacking, Arch-minister?

 previous night's walk had exhausted him.
 He had laid down to sleep right after dawn, his feet sore, his legs leaden
 with the weight of all the distance traveled so far.
 It was indeed a long ride from the northern lands, from Nicodemea south
 through the great farmlands of Rubnis.
 Then crossing the river Shielwa, and onto the western rough country of
 Ilonas, the shepherd country, more animal, hill and rock than man.

This was where the marble road leading into the Widelands begun.
 This was where his quest had taken him so far.
 For weeks he had been on the road, suffering fools too gladly sometimes,
 subjecting his body into such a trial of strength of will and body as traveling
 on foot for almost what seemed to be half around the world.
 Indeed a feat in itself, it was simply the means to far greater a prize,
 the complete knowledge of which still eluded him, despite all the years
 of studies and inquiries, both his and his master's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marble road started off as a narrow, thin road, small edges of pure
 white marble-like material delineating its boundaries.
 It was not really made from marble, for if it was it would have been demolished
 and chipped away bit by bit long ago.
 But it seems to defy any tool and machination of man, neither pickax nor
 chisel capable of even slightly damaging the road.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sleek, shiny white-gray road, cold to the touch but fine and delicate,
 like glass-work.
 But unbreakable, unyielding, unscathed by time, man, or nature.

 to construct such a piece of perfection, truly as some poet once said

It was, and had always been, part of the lands, but alien to them as well.
 The people had always known of the marble road, just as they knew of the
 trees, the mountains and the rivers, the forests and the glens, the fields
 and the wheat, the goat and the cow, the suns and the moon.
 But these things were of nature, and the marble road clearly was not, for
 nature abhors uniqueness.
 Animals come in pairs, rivers abound, so do trees.
 But there is only one marble road.
 A perfect thing; a left over from the time Gods walked among us.
 Or even so, before us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What reason was there behind it? Why does it lead into the Widelands? What
 is it made of? And who made it? With what tools, what materials did they
 use? They, because this must surely be the work of thousands.
 No single man could ever accomplish such a work in his lifetime.
 Perhaps, most rightly so, it is the work of the Gods.
 And to try and unravel their reasoning and purpose can only lead to madness,
 heresy, or both.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo decided to leave such thoughts aside, thoughts which beget questions
 that begged for answers he could not find.
 At least not before he ventured into the Widelands proper, until he found
 what Umberth described as the Necropolis, where inestimable knowledge was
 waiting to be uncovered to the world.
 Knowledge of a time unknown, perhaps before man ever walked the lands.
 The Time of the Gods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was already a fascinating sensation, walking upon the very same road
 that even the Gods might have walked upon once.
 What other man, apart from him and Umberth had dared walk the marble road
 unto its terribly unknown end? What other man, who lived long enough to
 tell the tale? What other man, who was not hunted down as a heretic, a
 blasphemer? What other man who didn't have a tragic, miserable end? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He grinned wickedly at these thoughts, for they were immediately followed
 by his aspirations: He wouldn't perish neither in the Widelands, nor at
 the hands of a fanatical mob, or the ever watchful Procrastinators.
 He would not succumb to any torture the Ministers might want to put him
 through for when all his trials and tribulation had come to pass this,
 he would not be simply a man anymore.
 He would not be hunted down, or exiled, or even held at bay, as a feared
 and terrible man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, when all the power and majesty and magnificence of the Gods was unveiled
 and made manifest through him, he would be transformed into a being of
 awe and power that the lands had not witnessed since the beginning of time.
 He would become a living deity, an avatar of the Gods, and he would be
 loved, and cherished, and worshiped as a God among men should.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew the truth of it, he could feel it in his heart and bones, see it
 in his twisting dreams.
 Dreams of cleansing light and fire, himself a creature of wrath and glory,
 terrible power at his hands and unimaginable purpose in his mind.
 The purpose of the Gods.
 Indeed it was their divine plan.
 Conceived and hatched untold eons ago, and he was their chosen instrument.
 He would not fail them.
 For the lust of that power burned deep withing, deeper than the need for
 breath itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he had indeed to find the Necropolis first, and that task seemed ever
 so slightly more difficult with each passing day.
 Last night he had found the marble road, and eagerly walked under the stars
 for a long stretch of time, without pause.
 He had seen the trees give way to bush, the grass wither, the sounds of
 animals grow weaker, fainter, fewer.
 He knew he was entering the Widelands, the signs visible around him.
 It had been the same with Umberth, as he had recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he laid down to sleep near the marble road, under a skinny old withered
 bark of a tree, a cluster of rocks sheltering him from the winds, he put
 his cloak under his head as a pillow, and drew his blanket high enough
 to cover his face from the rising suns, and slept lightly, with a smile
 on his face, as if he was merely a content child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he woke up in the afternoon, the suns still high, he was more than
 surprised to see that the road was not there.
 In fact, the road was nowhere in sight, as if he had dreamt of how he got
 where he was, or as if it was all in his mind which was starting to fade
 away into chaos, and madness.

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was sure he had been traveling in the correct direction.
 More than sure, he felt certain it was the right direction from the beginning.
 He had studied the maps his master had crafted painstakingly, with reverent
 attention to detail many times over, and he was certain he had correctly
 identified some, if not all of the landmarks mentioned in Umberth's tale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he was sure that when he stepped on the glistening white road, hard and
 unyielding, though soft to the touch, almost like metal but more like porcelain
 or clay, he was indeed walking on the marble road.
 And that when he got off the marble road in search of a place to sleep
 awhile and rest before following it once more, it would still be there,
 an undisturbed reality, a known quantity, a fact.
 By the Gods, it was a 
\shape slanted
road
\shape default
! Not a river to overflow, or dry up, or change its course! And even rivers
 have been known to take their time in such happenstance! How can something
 like the marble road disappear in a matter of hours?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps he was indeed losing his mind.
 Perhaps Umberth was a crazed old fool, and his esquire doubly so.
 And it had all been a fantasy to stir the minds most weak, those who were
 most prone to fall for grand visions, tales of mystery and untold secrets.
 And he had followed that fantasy in vain, like a fool the sort of which
 he despised and felt little less than pity for.
 He was a fool, half-mad and soon quite lost, left to fend for his life
 in this hostile land, with nothing of worth or substance to live off it.
 Such an unfitting end to a journey that should have changed the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Black despair seemed to take over him, his head swimming in a sea of moroseness,
 thoughts of ruin and death his mind's sole occupation.
 He was tense with bad temper.
 His fists were clenched, banging against a rock once every so often, as
 if it alone was to blame for his meandering path up to this foolishness.
 His despair turned into rage, overwrought since he was with anger at his
 failure.
 He retraced his thoughts and conversed silently with himself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would he accept an ignominious defeat at the hands of fate? Would he blindly
 give in to the temptation of despair? Throw away the years of studies and
 preparation? His long walk, his peregrination to the Land of the God unfinished
, nothing but an exercise in futility? And to what purpose would he devote
 himself now? What other singular task can match his ambition, his dreams
 beyond the realm of mortal men?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what if he was indeed a madman? What of it? Madmen answer to no one,
 only to the Gods.
 And so would he answer.
 The Land of the Gods beckoned.
 They tested his mettle.
 Only the one who is mad enough to challenge such authority can truly knock
 on the Holy Gates.
 He was all alone out here, in the Widelands.
 The marble road disappearing, was just the start.
 The beginning of the play the Gods seemed to love so much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would play.
 He would play in anything they chose to throw at him.
 He would find the Necropolis, at any cost.
 This, was merely an inconvenience, one of many he should still encounter.
 For once he set out, he knew he would be attempting a feat that almost
 no one had succeeded at before.
 And even if he did, as Umberth might have had, nothing was certain of the
 power therein, and how it would finally become his own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would have to see for his own, marble road or not.
 He got up decisively, and walked back to where he remembered the road lay
 exactly.
 He was standing either right on a spot where there was a road to be seen
 last night, or only a few feet away, he was certain.
 The grass had a wholesome quality, as if it had always covered the same
 ground as it did now, as if there never was a marble road here, not ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it was an illusion.
 A mirage.
 The only logical explanation he could arrive to with what little he knew
 of the marble road, and ignoring the possibility of him being mentally
 unstable, which was not helpful if at all true, this was the only reasonable
 explanation.
 The marble road was a lie, and by some sort of means unknown to man certainly,
 it was there to be seen, only to lure those that were mentally unprepared
 and easily misled and fooled deeper into the Widelands.
 A fly trap of sorts, he gathered.
 Well, that would be of little significance now that he had uncovered that
 the marble road was in fact not there at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thought took him to a passage from Umberth's tale, which made more sense
 now that he had seen this happen with his very own eyes.
 The passage read:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Only a few nights after we had gone definitely in Widelands country, we
 lost track of the road.
 Deciding to camp quite a distance away from the road, towards what had
 seemed to be a natural spring in a rock formation, we had lost sight of
 the marble road.
 We were doubly misled, since the spring had dried and was no more.
 The maps had failed us early on.
 Terlet went mad and master Umberth ordered me to put him out of his misery.
 Nubir and Vamden probably got lost trying to find the road, or simply decided
 to vanish before we went deeper into the Widelands.
 In any case, we never saw or heard of them again.

Molo had thought that they had indeed lost their bearings in the difficult
 to navigate terrain of the Widelands.
 That was why he didn't stray out of sight of the road.
 But it seemed that had little effect.
 The road had vanished seemingly of its own volition, or by forces and plans
 he could not understand and certainly not control.
 At least for now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He decided to continue on the same direction he had taken as before, when
 the road was still visible.
 The exact location of the Necropolis was a mystery, but he had arrived
 at the conclusion that it lay far enough deep into the Widelands, into
 the Dunes of the Widelands, the desert proper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he would grind along purposefully with the same eastward direction, deeper
 and deeper into the Widelands.
 He would try and record the distances traveled, counting his steps, in
 order to both focus his mind, as well as keep an account of how far deep
 each day of travel takes him.
 There will be time to recollect, muse, and decide on every next step when
 he stops to rest and take sustenance and water, two things that will indeed
 be scarce.

He still had a ready supply of honey-laden bars of nuts and sesame, a confection
 highly energetic, most appropriate for traveling long distances and generally
 when consuming one's energy.

 try and keep its usage at a minimum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more the Widelands turned into a desert, the more imperative it came
 for him to conserve his water.
 That is why he had chosen to travel at night, both to use its cover if
 anyone had been following him, and certainly because it was cooler at night,
 the walk not as demanding in both food or water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he still should be able to find some water until he went deep in the
 Dunes.
 There, he doubted any water could be found at all for days on end.
 And that was where he would either perish or triumph.
 Deep in the desert dunes of the Widelands, searching for the Necropolis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was his preferred way, what he thought was the most sensible one, he
 waited for dusk to come and the suns to come down the sky, before he would
 start walking again.
 He picked up his knapsack with what little more he carried within, picked
 up his walking stick and started off once more, feeling he had one a small
 battle today, renewed vigor and determination coursing through him.
 He needed no road to find his path, he would instead tread on relentlessly,
 and his path and journey would be sung in the eons to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept a count of his steps in his head, and focused his eyes on a specific
 star to follow, trying not to lose track of either his footsteps or his
 direction.
 And as he trod on, the star firmly fixed in his gaze, he thought he saw
 a great silver-white line appear in front of him, like someone had let
 open open a small slit of glittering light amidst the rocky desert night.
 He blinked, thinking he had not rested long enough, that the whole incident
 with the road was taxing his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he had this rush of exhilaration and hope, and started running
 towards the thin sliver of white in the dark.
 He ran as if his life depended on it, forgetting everything about counting
 steps or going in a straight line.
 He just ran ahead towards the straight white line that seemed to fill the
 horizon and was coming ever so closer to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the line had grown past a line into something recognizable indeed
 familiar, his aching feet and burning lungs meant nothing at all, for he
 was once again stepping on the marble road.
 He threw his head back and let his body drop on the road, laughing like
 a child who had found a toy he had thought lost.

A soldier is offered two ways to serve the Gods, the Council, and the people.
 That is, he can either be dead or alive, but he will still serve.
 A soldier might choose either, but one of the two has proved extremely
 popular, and for good reason.
 As a soldier myself, with as much experience as any can hope to amass over

The Patriarch smiled at the thought of people being capable of voicing such
 audacity and felt almost impressed.
 Naturally, such phenomena had subsided considerably after it became a well-know

 Still, from time to time people tend to forget what has passed, but they

 The procrastinators found him where you indicated he would be, but there
 was no sign of his accomplices, your Reverence.
 His name is Philo Dutur.
 These are his belongings you are examining, sir.

The Patriarch cast a gaze of subdued anger at the Inquisitor, his otherwise
 serene face causing a disturbing, fearful sensation.
 The effect was rather unsettling, and the Inquisitor bowed deeper still
 as a physical reaction to the Patriarch's menacing look.
 It was evident he felt real fear overtaking him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch took notice and felt pleased.
 Fear was most useful.
 He paused his examination of the items on the table, and turned to face
 the Inquisitor, offering him his complete focus and attention:

You should be careful not to recite the obvious, Chief Inquisitor.
 One might mistake you for a blabbering fool of little use beyond shoveling
 dung in the heat-pipes.
 Or even for committing blasphemy, taking me for a fool.
 That would be most unpleasant.
 I would have to choose a new Chief Inquisitor and the technicalities of
 such an affair, though I sometimes find pleasant, tend to bore me.
 Not to mention there are ongoing issues and little precious time, so please,
 Chief Inquisitor, spare me and tell me something useful.

The Patriarch seemed calm and restrained, but his last phrase was uttered

The Chief Inquisitor, who had witnessed and performed countless acts of
 relentless, inhuman torture, was apparently terrified at the prospect of
 the incurring the Patriarch's wrath, and physically recoiled, taking a
 step back, before kneeling to the wet, hard stone floor and begging in
 all fours:

I beg your forgiveness, most revered and wise of All, the Holy Avatar of

The Patriarch could see the man was visibly trembling.
 Another weak minded fool.
 He would have to dispense of him sooner rather than later, but not immediately.
 Other matters would have to take precedence.
 These traitors, more aptly sinners, pronouncing themselves rebels.
 The Kinsfolk.
 Delusional fanatics, sprouts of a seed long thought extinct.
 The dire remnants of a long lost cause.

His hands were finally, figuratively speaking of course, loose.
 He would break down their spine, their will, their determination.
 He had the means to accomplish that, and with some careful steps it would
 all seem so natural, so typical of failed revolutions, blood-soaked affairs
 of chasing wild dreams that turn into ashes when the night is through.

\begin_layout Standard
His part would be small, the stage would be filled with other characters,
 some willing and some not very so.
 But he would conduct the opening and closing lines of the chorus, and they
 would all dance to his tune.
 It would be a performance truly fit for Gods, if only for a limited audience.
 Nevertheless, he felt he would genuinely enjoy crushing these fools utterly,
 they would offer a fitting diversion indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had been absorbed in these thoughts for a rather discomforting period
 of time, the Inquisitor hanging by his ever word, or their absence.
 None dared break the forced, uneasy silence or his concentration.
 The prisoner stirred, awaking from a merciful sleep.

His moans drew the flogger's attention, who immediately reached for a barbed

\begin_layout Standard
As he drew far back to have more room to lash out to the chained man, a

, the Patriarch's voice deafeningly booming, matching and perhaps surpassing
 the authority he was imparted with, however impossible that would be.
 The torture chamber reverberated with his voice for mere moments, the flames
 of the torches quivering in response, as if the air had been momentarily
 sucked out of the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flogger set down his instrument of torture, bowed reverently but as
 fast as it would seem prudent, and then stepped back from the chained form
 of Philo, standing still, his gaze nowhere near the direction of the Patriarch.

The Inquisitor managed a slightly expectant look towards the Patriarch,
 awaiting for the a casual flick of the Rod that would sentence him to excruciat

 much more painful agonizing unseen methods of torment at his disposal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No such move was made.
 The Patriarch instead motioned with his left hand, the unadorned one, the
 Mourning hand, for the Inquisitor to rise, before adding:

The Inquisitor, a middle aged man, lean, with an austere face, would normally
 look menacing and unyielding to a common townsfolk, with his robes and
 sigil of office and rank, someone important and powerful, someone to be

He now seemed instead, a hollow, reduced man: his surplice spoiled and mudded,
 his face contorted with imagined agony in the hands of the Patriarch, and
 his feet barely able to support his weight, slight tremors coursing through
 his body.
 He simply managed to croak:

The Patriarch was studying the prisoner intently with a frowned face, as
 if trying to uncover everything he needed to know merely by watching hard
 enough.
 His right hand, the one adorned with Holy Diadems, was scratching his chin
 in a rather detached, insouciant way, starkly in contrast with his earlier
 searing demeanor.
 He addressed the Inquisitor without turning around or even slightly moving
 his head, his voice carrying hints of aggravation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What you need, Inquisitor, are lessons in silence.
 You would have killed him without getting a word out of him.

 Leave the chamber now, both of you.

The Patriarch's voice carried a finality that could not be challenged.
 The flogger did not even bother picking up his tools, bowing once more
 hastily but affording proper reverence and then quickly heading towards
 the badly lit staircase that led to the upper levels of the tunnels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Inquisitor had no intention of uttering a single sentence that could
 very well be his last, and with series of deep bows and small steps, made
 his way to the staircase as well, being very cautious not to turn his back
 to the Patriarch at any one point.
 The minute he reached the base of the stairs and as he was ready to turn
 and hurriedly run them up, the Patriarch raised his left hand and with
 gaze still locked on Philo, asked the Inquisitor:
\end_layout

The men you sent after the sinners, deep into the tunnels, did you take

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Inquisitor stood at the base of the stairs, one foot already on their
 steps, then bowing low he replied in a somewhat controlled voice, rather
 than his earlier mewling tone:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch's last words struck true with the Inquisitor who managed to
 simply nod and rushed up the stairs as if swaths of fire were behind him.
 A dull metal thud echoed, the large door to this chamber closing right
 behind the Inquisitor, who walked closer to Philo, still alive and awake,
 unable to look at him face to face.
 A grin that threatened to tear the Patriarch's face apart suddenly appeared
 on his face, his teeth revealed to be an immaculate pearly white.

\begin_layout Standard
His next steps took him closer to Philo, the Patriarch's boots barely making
 an audible impression on the stone floor.
 He noticed the pool of clotted blood lying under Philo, his back a horrible
 mess of deep gouges and bloody wounds.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rivulets of blood stained his whole body, from his shoulders down to his
 legs.
 His feet were bare and bruised livid, the skin so deeply stained crimson
 that it was almost impossible to know whether there was any of it left.
 Philo's thickset body had lost its healthy color, and seemed only a little
 less than feeble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo did not answer verbally, neither did he nod.
 He simply spat vehemently, a thick mix of blood and saliva landing on the
 pool of his own blood, the little splash audible enough to register as
 an action defiance, or even possibly indifference.

These amateurs who worked on you, were thorough, I'll give them that.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch had leaned closer to Philo, he was standing on his right side,
 looking at him with bright enthusiasm, expectancy loitering timidly in
 his voice.
 The Patriarch wished dearly for an easy answer, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that would make things smooth and civil.
 A recognition of being outplayed, an acceptance of defeat, the knowledge
 of pointlessness proven in Philo's resignation from the fight before it
 could even really begin.
 Such a joy, the feeling of superiority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Patriarch also knew Philo would not choose the easy way out.
 He was too proud, too ignorant and too stupid to do so, to spare himself
 further unreached before heights of pain, unbearable humiliation, and in
 the end, total destruction of his mind, body, and soul.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He must have thought himself already a martyr for his cause, a proud shining
 beacon against the darkness.
 Someone for the others to follow as an example, an stoic fighter, a proud
 man that could not be brought low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How embarrassingly naive.
 He would leave his tongue and throat intact for as long as possible.
 Their own screams always became insufferable.
 He would drive him mad, when he was through with him.
 A mad, witless fool.
 Not a martyr, but a wretched sack of flesh.
 Nothing.
 He would obliterate him utterly in the most literal sense.
 Philo Dutur would be in all manners erased, as he had never even existed
 or indeed been born.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah, the small mercies, the little joys of his life and work.
 That was what kept him interested, what made him tick.
 In the end, it would all have been worth it, just for these bright moments
 of uninhibited truth and feeling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the cries blanketed all the senses, thoughts and feelings.
 When the reality of pain promoted a higher sense of self, when the men
 and women that received his attention were indeed enlightened, their forms
 pure and bright right before they ended, like the last light of dying suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was, the Patriarch thought, an art form.
 He wished he could make Philo understand before he began, but that would
 be an effort in futility.
 Words would not affect him, his ears and mind were closed shut to him,
 that much was certain.
 It was of little consequence, because soon he would be so much more receptive,
 like a child only now beginning to learn, he would learn so much about
 him in so little time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch was filled with a fleeting sensation of jealousy, he though
 to himself how blessed indeed these people were, to be stripped down to
 their essential self, see for just once clearly what everything meant,
 the truth of life bared naked before their crying souls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost wished he could experience that first hand, but he had the knowledge
 ingrained.
 The pain and sensation were not worth as much as the revelation did.
 He felt almost violated, robbed of his right to discover, experience, learn
 anew.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was as if he was a mere tool, that should never amount to much.
 A useful but otherwise uninteresting tool.
 These people here, these were considered so much more intriguing, entertaining,
 mysteries worth uncovering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An inner rage that had been left neglected for too long, flared up again.
 He could use that rage, he would make Philo really believe.
 Not just acquiesce, or give up his friends, his family or all that he loved
 and held dear.
 He would make him a true believer, a man happy to die in servitude at long
 last.
 The Patriarch told him, with a laugh and a grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I'll make you believe, Philo.

And to accentuate his point, Philo did spit once more, reddish saliva coming
 out of his mouth, the broken teeth and wounds in his mouth still bleeding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch replied in a candid way, as if exchanging opinions with a
 peer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
And with that, the Patriarch reached for Philo's chains, a mere touch of
 his unlocking the first one, Philo's body swaying immediately to his other
 chained side.
 It was all very sudden, and Philo barely had time to put his feet down
 to be able to stand instead of slumping on the stone floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Patriarch unchained his remaining hand, Philo tried to act as fast
 as possible.
 His right, drooping side was nearer the Patriarch, so he mustered all the
 strength that he could and focused it on his elbow, suddenly jutting it
 towards the Patriarch's groin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did that, he was already clenching his left fist, trying to gather
 some momentum by twisting his torso and perhaps landing a good punch on
 the Patriarch.
 This was probably his last and only opportunity, so he thought he'd make
 it count and go for the kill as well, his thought focusing on the motley
 arsenal of torturing tools available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His elbow did not connect with the Patriarch.
 Instead he felt a rush of air, as if a void was suddenly created were the
 Patriarch was standing.
 As his torso swooped around in its instinctive movement, his feet swiveled
 to accommodate the sudden move, and his left fist came rushing down only
 to meet thin air.
 His body was awkwardly positioned now, and precariously balanced, like
 the mock statue of a victor or an athlete, about to fall off his feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch was not where he should have been, and was instead at Philo's
 left side now, like he had instantly sidestepped him with inhuman speed,
 reflexes and foresight.
 As Philo turned his bruised head around, one eye completely hidden behind
 swollen tissue, the other one almost damaged and bled beyond recognition,
 but still seemingly functional, he managed to ask the Patriarch, evidently
 surprised and dumbstruck:

And yet another smirk before he laid out his right hand, his adorned hand,
 the Hand of Tribulation, and grasped Philo from his forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Philo went limp almost instantly, his big bulk sagging down onto the floor,
 legs sprawled awkwardly, arms simply resting against his body, barely touching
 the bloodied floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His face, or what was still left of it, tried to take on an expression of
 pain, flinch and contort.
 Instead, it slackened, his mouth opened up to reveal broken death, open
 sores and wounds.
 He started mewling incoherently, blood and saliva dribbling down his chin,
 incomprehensible words sputtered in blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch smiled, his face lit up and seemed pleased that his work was
 beginning to take form now.
 He asked Philo in a sweet, inviting voice:

Philo seemed to twist his body a little, as if trying to escape an invisible

Philo let out a deep moan, and his eyes tried to let tears flow, but it
 was nearly impossible.
 His eyes were almost swollen shut, tears welling up constantly, making
 his vision, if he had any left, a complete blur.
 His moaning became deeper, his body shaken by involuntary spasms.

The Patriarch screamed in hellish fury, the air around them cracking audibly,
 small arcs of blue lightning flickering between the Patriarch's ringed

Philo's skull was throbbing, enormous veins jutting out ready to burst and
 his flesh was beginning to turn red hot.

 if about to snap off its place:

He let go of Philo, who instantly regained some sort of composure, though
 he was drained of his vitality to the point of death, his body barely alive,
 his every breath copious and painful.
 Breathing deeply, his voice now little more than a whisper, he said amidst
 weeps and moans of pain:

 The screams filled the chamber, echoing through the stone surface.

The guards above the torture chamber were used to the cries of the sinners.
 But not to whatever it was that they were hearing.
 They became uneasy.
 At length, one of them vomited.

When the other guards came to relieve them, the screams and voices could

 And that went on, and on.
 All through the night.

When the Patriarch emerged from the door of the torture chamber, the guards

 sky silently put aside when the fatigue took over and the anxiety and nervousne
ss subsided after their thirst had been quenched and a warm, tasty meal
 sat comfortably in their bellies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was snoring heavily now, and though it would have normally been less
 than a pleasant sound, under the circumstances it was mildly comforting,
 as it let Amonas know that not everything was amiss, that some things were
 still normal, albeit frustrating and hard to deal with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a thing was Hilderich snore.
 Amonas tried to picture a future lady D'Augnacy trying to go to sleep next
 to the man, but failed to end his train of thought in anything other than
 a grin or a hearty laughter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded to himself as he thought that it was a good thing that Hilderich
 had slept after all that had happened to him, he definitely needed sleep
 more than himself.
 Not that he didn't wish for sleep to come, and bless him with a few precious
 hours of oblivion and rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a nagging feeling he knew, that rest would not come even in his sleep.
 Nightmares would haunt him, as long as he was away from Celia, as long
 as he couldn't know what would befall her should he fail to return, if
 he was stranded in this lush version of hell with Hilderich as his sole
 companion for the rest of their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least, before they turned on each other, went mad or took their own lives
 as their last meaningful action, sparing them a life of torture and sleepless,
 unending days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was sitting cross-legged, outside the cover of the small makeshift
 shelter he had fashioned, where most of it was taken over by the sprawled
 figure of Hilderich, who seemed to be thankfully quite at ease sleeping
 on the ground, with nothing but his already muddied and stained cloak as
 a mattress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He, on the other hand, could not let himself surrender to sleep.
 It was not the lack of moon, or the invariably harsh conditions of continuous
 light, unbearable heat and sticky moisture, that prevented him from having
 some kind of much needed rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was as was the case most of the time, his mind that could not be appeased,
 that could not be turned off as it should.
 The immediate necessities had taken their toll already.
 The search for water which he still didn't know if it was indeed drinkable,
 the food he hoped would not prove much of a problem now that they knew
 there was at least something edible to be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was not just the simple minded anxiety of surviving.
 It was this strange new environment, totally unlike anything he had experienced
 before.
 Certainly nothing he knew ever existed, even on the most faraway lands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the suns were wrong too.
 This might not even be their own world.
 The thought had unconsciously been formed before, when they first saw that
 clear, harsh sky.
 But now it took form, voice, he could here the thought ringing loudly in
 his head.
 This might be another world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultimate truth revealed in form and substance all over him.
 And he had no one to share it but Hilderich, who might even hold it yet
 as suspicious, implausible at best.
 Another world.
 But no animals to speak of, no people, however queer or similar, however
 friendly or hostile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He suddenly felt terribly alone, as if indeed the thought of them being
 the sole two individuals on this other world was weighing him down, grinding
 him to the ground.
 Just the two of them, wandering like castaways on a strange and mysterious
 island where no ship would ever sail to.
 An uncharted land, its existence always hidden away, never to be revealed,
 their bones bleached and turned into lime for the wild growths to set roots
 in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His gaze turned to the tiny flickers of the fire, a few coals still red
 hot, thin lines of smoke rising from the perpetually wet wood.
 He focused on the fire, marveling at its simple avarice, consuming the
 wood steadily, unperturbed, without a care for the world at large.
 A force of nature.
 A universal truth, fire.
 It eats away as much as it can and then it perishes on its own accord,
 accepting its fate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How he longed for such simplicity in life.
 Away from all this, this world, the other world he knew as home.
 Away from the Castigator's tyranny and its false Gods.
 Away from poverty and the coming war and the misery that would ensue no
 matter who the victor was.
 How much he had wanted to get away from all that, with Celia by his side.
 And they could let the world burn for all he cared.
 Just like fire burns on wood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He smirked despite himself, thinking he was letting himself down somehow.
 Perhaps he had been too morose in his thoughts, their plight so far sinking
 his feeling even more than he had realized.
 It would do him no good, that he knew.
 No matter whether any of these thoughts hold to the truth in the end, they
 would do him no real good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew that thinking too much and acting too little had brought everything
 to this point.
 A rule of tyranny, based on lies and deceit.
 People dying everyday of famine, or rotting away in eternally dark dungeons
 for stealing a loaf of bread, or having children without permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He shook his head.
 Permission was needed to create life.
 As if any God would need to consider the utility of the inevitable, the
 unimpeachable, the unstoppable force of life that permeated everything,
 from the worms in the ground to the stars themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed a sad moment when a star fell; but someone had said that another
 one was born at the same time.
 He had no way of knowing that for sure, since who could count the innumerable
 stars or the grains of sand in a beach? But he knew it in his heart it
 would be true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Life just keeps happening.
 Whether anyone permits it or not, it just doesn't care and blindly goes
 on whatever the cost.
 Even in this place.
 There might have encountered no animals so far, but the vegetation..
 Astounding, lush, green.
 If it wasn't so damn hot and humid he could have felt like living here
 for ever.
 Him, Celia, and their children.
 The many more to come after his firstborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would he ever live to see all that come true?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sighed as he mentally chastised himself for thinking in such an almost
 saturnine way.
 He stood up, deciding to clear his mind, flush it clean of any thought.
 Any kind of action would do his spirits good.
 And since he couldn't rest or sleep, a mild activity that would not drain
 him of much energy, would be a welcome change in pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would go for a walk, in a way exploring their immediate surroundings,
 perhaps even scouting ahead their path to the bull-horned structure, that
 huge fork of a structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich stirred in his sleep, and mumbled something inaudible, licking
 his lips and smiling lightly.
 He must be dreaming, Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that Hilderich could sleep as if nothing of import had transpired
 over the past few days, brought a smile of hope to Amonas' lips.
 Perhaps not everyone looked on things so dourly, and had good reason not
 to.
 So did he, he thought to himself, bringing an image of lovely Celia to
 his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lovely Celia, her hair touching her slender body with grace enough to make
 any man weep from the joyful sight, and instantly adore her beyond reason.
 Her face a sweet and mellow taste, if his eyes could swallow her whole,
 and forever feel her smile.
 Celia beloved, and to the death his mate and pair.
 His firstborn's mother to be, his miraculous haven where every storm subsided
 and all the seas came to rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was not far from giving birth to their child, and though they had known
 bloodied times of fire, steel and death were drawing close, he had at least
 the surety of her touch and her smile to count on and see life or death
 by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now he was denied of her touch, the smell of her breath, the feeling of
 her body clasped against his own, her gaze locked with his own, oceans
 of time passing by in mere moments.
 Damn them! For that hurt alone, he would make them pay.
 Whoever was indeed behind all the lies and curtains of deceit.
 Behind the Castigator.
 He could feel there must be something to the Gods.
 Every lie, he had observed, has been sown from some truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he walked about the place, he noticed more and more beauty and celebrating
 life in this otherwise simmering cauldron of green.
 Small colorful flowers with overgrown petals and fat, juicy stems.
 Lithe trees that could be easily bent without being broken, and thick overgrown
 plants that dared climb the huge trees, hugging them, curled around them
 like charmed snakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed teeming with life.
 It remained a mystery to Amonas why they had come across no animals at
 all, barely enough insects to simply make their unwanted stay even more
 miserable.
 He mused for a while at the strange color of the only sun, and decided
 he could not come up with anything resembling an explanation other than
 this was another world to their own, indeed wholly alien and undecipherable,
 at least with the knowledge at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps they could learn more of it before they returned, but that would
 be more in Hilderich's domain, not his own.
 He was more interested in solving problems, not analyzing them thoroughly
 and documenting them for posterity and further study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be a strange day indeed when he would be able to sit in a chair
 and tell his grandchildren stories of the other world.
 Or maybe even worlds.
 If there are indeed more than one, why just two?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The walk had made him thirsty, and he felt like maybe it was time for him
 to return, and with his mind put a little bit at ease, perhaps try for
 some restful sleep.
 Even though he was used to hardship, sleep was essential, and no one could
 go more than a day or so without some sleep, however little.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had also climbed up an inviting tree, in an effort to see over the canopy
 if at all possible, get their bearings, so they could start off in the
 right direction for the nearest bull-horn.
 Getting the direction wrong while already being lost would be a blow to
 their morale, let alone a waste of precious time and meager resources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back in their own world, the Kinsfolk were about to strike for the first
 and hopefully the last time.
 Years of planning had led to this culminating point, and an untold number
 of his brethren had lost their lives in the effort of keeping it a secret
 alone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew they were being followed, he knew they were being watched.
 But he also knew they were waiting for the right time to act, catch them
 all in one fell blow, root them out forever, crush them utterly and dispense
 with the notion of a rebellion for untold generations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would be there when the time came, that much was the least expected of
 him.
 And he'd rather die trying rather than abandon and shame his brothers in
 blood and soul.
 Or face the wrathful scorn of Celia; no, he could never suffer that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weak but warm smile crept on his face as he imagined such a scene, Celia
 all fiery wrath, her gaze searing, boring through him as if he were made
 of powdery snow, and he laughed despite himself, memories of her rushing
 through him like a stream of water on parched land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he approached their tiny camp he could hear Hilderich screaming his name
 over the top of his lungs, probably terrified at the thought that he had
 gone and left him there to die all alone, a final twist of a incongruously
 ill fate.
 He answered back, his strong gruff voice undimmed by the blanket of vegetation
 all around them:
\end_layout

Coming Hilderich! Just went for a walk!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without yet being able to actually see him, Amonas heard Hilderich cry out
 in a near falsetto:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Damn you I thought you'd left me here to rot!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few more steps brought Amonas nearer to their camp where he could see
 Hilderich quite evidently disheveled, his hair in wild disarray from the
 sleep and the humid hell they had to endure, his clothing almost unrecognizable
 by now, a uniformly gray and brown mud covering most of it.
 Amonas waved a dismissing hand from afar, laughed heartily and replied
 playfully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'd never leave you behind to rot, Hilderich.
 Simmer a little perhaps, but never rot!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He good humor went largely unnoticed by Hilderich, whose spirits where in
 sharp contrast.
 He looked genuinely hurt, glum and uninspired, giving Amonas a picture
 of how he must've looked a couple of hours before.
 The thought sobered his mood, and thought he had better make Hilderich
 bounce back from what must have been a seriously rude awakening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was keeping silent, casting a look of rightful accusation at Amonas,
 who thought it a little childish and perhaps somewhat unbecoming of a man.
 But their situation was indeed unique and perhaps he was asking too much
 of the man already.
 He cast those blemished thoughts aside and instead spoke from the heart,
 seeking to calm Hilderich and soothe his fear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am sorry I left you alone, but I could not sleep.
 I went for a walk, but I was close by.
 I heard you when you called, didn't I? I could not have been very far.
 You were as safe as I could vouch for in such a place.
 So please, accept my apologies and think no more of it.
 It only helps to aggravate you, and lower your spirits.
 Here, have some of this.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas reached into his small sack and brought out a small roundish object
 covered in what seemed to be something like hair, thin strands of wood
 or brown parched grass.
 He used his knife to chop off a small slice from its top, then offered
 it to Hilderich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich made a gesture to take the proffered little ball, which looked
 to be white on the inside, but he shook his head and gave it back to Amonas,
 a hesitant look on his face, a quavering quality in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You try it first.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' pride was stung, since Hilderich seemed to imply that he might be
 trying to poison him.
 He was about to go off on a rant unfitting his character, about how misguided
 and foolish a person must to still be unable to trust him after what has
 befallen them, but wisely decided against that.
 After his initial surprise and shock lifted from his expression, he took
 the strange cross between a hairy nut and a fruit in his hands, and drank
 a good mouthful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After he had quite thoroughly sloshed it around his mouth in an evident
 display of the juice's potable quality, he swallowed and offered it back
 to Hilderich who accepted it, even though still reluctantly, sniffing the
 watery liquid inside the strange fruit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's sweet and refreshing.
 Almost better than water.
 Drink up, you'll like it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was motioning with his head for Hilderich to drink, urging him to
 just have a taste, while Hilderich slowly brought the fruit to his lips,
 eying Amonas warily at the some time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a brief pause and a small period of uncertainty, Hilderich finally
 took a small sip, swallowed, and then surprising even himself in the process,
 proceeded to empty the small ball of a fruit of its watery content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas grinned in a relaxed manner, and as he laid down to the ground to
 enjoy at least a few minutes, he said to Hilderich after closing his eyes
 and covering his face with one arm, the other resting at his stomach:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't kill you with fruit Hilderich.
 There were ample opportunities with better tools.
 We need to trust each other to make it back, that much I can assure you.

Oh I know about your assurances so far.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's tone was rather that of a grudging complaint rather than gross
 accusation.
 He might be right, Amonas thought, but now was not the time to settle such
 a score.
 He hoped that they would make it back, become friends, and Hilderich would
 forgive him for the misfortunes brought upon him.
 But until then, Amonas' patience would be tried and tested at almost every
 chance.
 He replied in kind, eyes still covered by his arm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Opportunities may arise once more, don't make me want to take advantage

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich opened his mouth wide in what seemed a mock expression of shock,
 before composing himself once more, straightening up and saying in what
 seemed to be his formal tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll restrain from further commenting on the problematic issue and instead
 focus on more worthwhile endeavors, such as getting back.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas smiled even as he said in a genuinely friendly tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's more befitting a Curator now, isn't it?Let me catch some sleep, and
 then we will be off to the bull-horned structure.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought had occurred to him, but he had not given it much thought.
 With the death of his master and half-way in his apprenticeship, he was
 now considered, officially, though without seat, a Curator, with all the
 rights and responsibilities his office carried.
 It was certainly not an apt time, but he felt somewhat proud, and suddenly
 all too grown up and a bit older than he thought possible.
 Amonas added as an afterthought:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Don't fret over it.
 You can do whatever you like for a while, as long as you don't get lost.
 Study the trees or the insects, do something a Curator would do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded silently and appreciatively, before heading off to a nearby
 log of wood, half of it rotting away, creeping with maggots and worms,
 what he had been taught was the basis of a healthy and fertile ground.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time passed quickly for Hilderich, who uncovered all sorts of different
 layers of decaying wood, noticing the wood's grain, the various kinds of
 insects that used it as housing, food, or what seemed to be a combination
 of the two, eating tunnels through it on which then they laid eggs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was fascinating, he thought, to witness a whole civilization of insects
 in its various stages and levels unfolding in front of you in a simple
 piece of wood, right in front of your eyes, at your very hands.
 How tempting it felt to push the eggs around, see how the insects would
 react, or douse them with water and see whether they'd drown.
 But he was taught that nature knew best, and men could only learn from
 it, not change it.
 At least not for better.
 So he let the insects be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he did so and paused his study of the insect-ridden log, he noticed
 Amonas had quietly awoken, seemingly quite refreshed and energized.
 He asked him if he had slept well, to which Amonas answered after briefly
 thinking about it:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Good enough.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas then made some broth of what he had found to be adequate substitute
 for uwe, and sipped appreciatively.
 As before, he offered some to Hilderich who again politely refused, but
 did not resort to his small flask of gin.
 He wisely assumed that they would need more of it to light up a fire, and
 more than just once.
 So he kept Amonas quiet company, until they would move on again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once they did, Amonas led the way once more with quite deliberation, carefully
 choosing his path as if he could smell their destination however afar it
 might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Hilderich, it was unfathomable how any man could navigate practically
 blindly, without a map or a solid point of reference, simply by hunch and
 a general feeling of direction, both even more easily fooled in a chaotic
 mass of vegetation such as the one they were entangled in currently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Amonas felt Hilderich needed time to rest, he paused, and made sure
 Hilderich was ready to move on before they set off again.
 Hilderich felt quietly thankful of that small matter and made every effort
 to proceed in a timely manner, never dallying too long, until either they
 had walked for the better part of what would amount to a day in this accursed
 place, or until they had reached the bull-horned building.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heat was as always unbearable and the moisture nearly debilitating,
 but they trudged along, hoping to strike lucky soon.
 If nothing else, Hilderich hoped they would soon rest for what should have
 been night time.
 Lost in thought and numbed by fatigue, Hilderich bumped unwillingly onto
 Amonas, who seemed to have suddenly stopped.
 Hilderich apologized curtly and asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pardon me for running onto you like you were made of air, but why have we
 stopped? Are we here yet? I can't see anything like a wall or stones or
 something resembling a construction.
 So does that mean we can rest now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's voice had an unmistakably pleading quality, and though it would
 be indeed great if they had reached their intended destination, it would
 be nothing short of bliss if they would stop and sleep for now.
 Amonas knew what Hilderich was thinking from the look on his face and the
 expectancy in his voice, and replied with a question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Did you notice something about this place?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Hilderich was still catching his breath when he said to Amonas in a knowing
 manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's too hot and too wet for comfort, what else is there to notice?That

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was about to make some comment in the same vein as the previous
 one, complaining about sore feet and an empty stomach, not to mention a
 dried out mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But once he paused for little more than a moment, he felt it.
 A light breeze, chilly to the touch, a swift rush of air like a cloud from
 the heavens.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was genuinely surprised, and looked fittingly puzzled.
 As he tried to make sense of it, Amonas added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well it's not chilly.
 It's not that hot, cool would be a better choice of words.
 And the light is less intense, it's almost like an overcast sky.
 Like a shadow is over us.
 We're in its shadow, Hilderich.
 The shadow of the bull-horn.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was enjoying the cool breeze when he pleaded once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Would it be then advisable to get some more sleep now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas laughed out heartily at that display of good-humored single-mindedness,
 and feeling his spirits lifted, laid down and started singing a tune his
 grandfather used to sing when they were fishing together, down by the river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was complaining that his stomach felt empty, and that they had
 not secured a source of fresh water.
 He also heard some grumblings about him doing all the really necessary
 stuff, and that Curators should be treated respectfully rather than being
 ignored profoundly.
 He stated that he would nevertheless procure some sort of food since he
 was the only reliable and responsible person in this world which might
 or might not be an entirely different one from the one they called home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas kept on singing heedless of Hilderich's protests, thinking he would
 be soundly asleep before he had time to finish the song came to a finish.
 As the moments went by, his voice became softer and shallower, and then
 he stopped altogether.
 Indeed, within moments he fell into a slumber, where he dreamt of Celia,
 and in the dream he could feel the cool breeze that was her smile.

Pretty soon, he was snoring heavily, as if he had not a worry in this or

 had woken as early as every day, giving thanks to God for allowing him
 to live and breathe once more, and greeted the suns as they rose with a
 hearty smile.
 His hair was as always tousled, gently swayed by the light breeze coming
 down from the mountains and onto the plains that filled his entire view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once more he had used his walking stone to guide him, and before noon had
 passed he entered the Land of God proper.
 He had been warned to be wary of these lands, for not everything that roamed
 it was graced by God, and not all that he may encounter was sent by Him
 alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The devious others had plans of their own, and would likely oppose him when
 they saw fit.
 He should steel himself wholeheartedly if he were to carry on with his
 Pilgrimage, and meet his ineffable destiny.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he did step foot on the Widelands, it was as the elders had said it
 would be: A flat and uninviting country, with low grass and trees few and
 afar, the sounds of animals and birds lost in an emptiness that defied
 the senses and made one humble and awestruck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the True Path appeared in its glistening beauty and perfection, as
 had done so many times before.
 He was witnessing the path to his own destiny, and soon he was walking
 on it, treading lightly and with reverence, whenever possible, but making
 haste and good speed, for what good was the path, if he dawdled on it for
 longer than prudence would allow?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As his peregrination took him further into the Land of God, his thoughts
 coalesced bit by bit into how this land was perhaps purposefully designed,
 meant to evoke ascetic feelings.
 Civilization in any form had been kept away from the Land of God, as if
 it had preordained that these lands would forever be a sanctum, a land
 devoted to praising God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a land indeed forbidden to most mortal men, uninviting, almost hostile
 as far as he could tell until now.
 And the Path was there, a clear sign of God's design, a Path for true believers
, a Path for those that came with holy fire burning in their heart, searching
 for God, a divine purpose guiding them deeper into a land that would normally
 kill a man of hunger, thirst or pure exhaustion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance lacked meaning in the Land of God, which almost defied logic in
 its flatness, its emptiness, an emptiness only the love of God and faith
 in him could fill.
 A terrible void that shrank the impure soul and made an unwilling mind
 recoil in awe, a land that turned the unbeliever away, a land where the
 mandate of God was carried ever more strongly by the formidable gusts of
 wind that swiped its every acre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed magnificent to behold, the will of God made manifest all around
 him, a sacred place that he was not only allowed, but indeed expected to
 traverse to its very heart, and complete his Pilgrimage, as his God and
 his people demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
God, in his inestimable wisdom had prepared the land more than well enough
 for a believer, for someone who lived and died with His name upon his lips,
 His thought in his mind and His image in depths of his soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water, he could find in the small damp spots around the Path, when night
 fell and a hazy carpet of fog crept across the immeasurably flat land.
 He would dig, with either his hands or a small flat piece of rock, and
 he would find a few mouthfuls of water to sustain him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when he felt hungry and tired, his strength about to leave him, as if
 God kept an ever watchful eye on him from afar, a small thin bush laden
 with tiny berries would appear near the road, or a small colony of ants
 or some other kind of insect he could eat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He always thanked God for these small mercies that kept him fit and healthy,
 that kept him going without delays, other than a few brief stops and some
 much needed sleep.
 His clothing was good for the Holy Land as it was for the lands where his
 people dwelt.
 Perhaps it was not as cold during the day, but the nights became colder
 the farther deep he went while following the Path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept the wise council of his elders, and never strayed off the road.
 He kept on it at all times, and when he could, when leaving it to get to
 a source of water or find something to eat, he would always leave his walking
 stone on it, with a piece of woolen string attached to it, laying it behind
 him as he walked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then when he had drank or filled his belly, he would pick up the string
 and walk right back to the Path and the walking stone.
 It was said, that if one strayed off the Path, he might never find it again
 for as long as he walked the Land of God.
 It was blasphemy, for the Path to be revealed to you and then choose to
 leave it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he would lay behind him a piece of string, to always connect himself
 with the Path, even when not directly on it.
 And that he would do by strict necessity, and only after solemn prayer
 in which he would beg for forgiveness and recognize his own imperfection
 and crude humanity that had afflicted him with the feeling of hunger and
 thirst.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, he hoped and prayed, God would not be offended and would find it in
 his heart like a loving father to allow the Path to remain, to guide his
 faithful servant on to his Holy destination, beyond all the hardships and
 dangers that might arise in his quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For if it was a simple, sheltered matter, it would matter not at all how
 the Pilgrimage was made.
 Anyone would walk about the Holy Lands, especially the deceitful liars
 and archenemies of Gods and their followers, soiling the land and air with
 their mere breaths and unclean feet, poisoning the very air with their
 hideous laughter and venomous lies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, it was not a simple affair walking through the Land of God.
 And that was why he kept praying each and ever waking moment, to thank
 his God for his magnanimous and benevolent nature, to thank him for allowing
 to draw breath, and drink water as he needed it, and feast upon the fruit
 and the very life of His Land, for his heart to keep beating, for his hands
 to touch the Holy Soil without being struck down, without being deemed
 unworthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was almost dusk, on the third day since he had set foot on the Land of
 God.
 It was once more time for prayer.
 He laid down his small sack, and took off his cloak, setting it down in
 front of him.
 He then knelt on the cloak, and closed his eyes, his arms resting on his
 legs, the palms of his hands touching his knees.
 He then started bowing down low, his forehead touching the Path every time,
 whispered words of reverence coming out of his mouth, in the tongue of
 God which they no longer used, but kept handing down as holy passages,
 from mouth to mouth, and generation to generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he could not understand what the words were saying, he could feel
 their perfection rippling through the air, Holy words spoken in the Land
 of God, like a river mingling with the sea.
 A small trickle of divinity flowing onto the essence of God made manifest,
 the air, earth and water resonating with godly purpose and sacrosanct silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence His words, the Holy Mantra, which should normally be shouted aloud
 for all of Creation to bear witness to his grandeur and wisdom.
 In the Holy Land, in His Land, His Domain, it would be sacrilege to utter
 them in anything above a whisper.
 For every grain of sand, and every wisp of air, every drop of water carried
 everything back to him, voice, thought and deed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he bowed in homage to the creation of God all around him, grandiose,
 majestic, striking chords buried deep inside his very essence and soul,
 he felt pride in his heritage, his people, his purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He cast it swiftly aside, since pride was a double-edged blade, ready to
 cut into him when he would feel invincible, safe, powerful and righteous.
 That was not God's way; God taught humility, wisdom, faith, belief and
 love.
 Not pride, arrogance and lust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Holy Land was indeed a place to be wary.
 Even in paying homage to God, the ruinous ones could find a man's weakness
 and seep inside him, all the while he believed he was walking the True
 Path.
 The Path is not just this white, slick and unending road; it is a state
 of mind and soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He made the sign of God with his outstretched palms facing towards the falling
 suns, the rising moon a faint gossamer red shadow in the hazy distance,
 where only the line of the dark crimson horizon could be identified with
 difficulty over the misty green and yellow of the rising mist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood up on his two feet and wore his cloak, picking up his sack and
 setting off down the road once again.
 As the chilly night rushed to meet him, he thought he could see a figure
 like a mirror of himself walking on the road towards him.
 He squinted his eyes as tried to make sense of what he was seeing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a man, not very much unlike him, lean and not very tall.
 His stride seemed purposeful, and if he had taken notice of him walking
 on the Path, he showed no sign of alarm, surprise or fear.
 It was as if he would go on nevertheless, as if he was nothing but a phantom,
 an apparition of the Holy Lands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But maybe this was what he was seeing.
 Stranger things had been heard around the life-stones during the coldest
 nights at his people's gatherings.
 It would not be without precedent that he should meet a ghost of the Holy
 Lands, perhaps some other Pilgrim before him who wandered the Holy Lands
 and warned the Pilgrims and the faithful, guided them through danger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps he was a messenger from God Himself, though it might be presumptuous,
 even blasphemous, to think that God would seek to aid him in such straightforwa
rd ways that completely and blatantly proved his Divine existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he reminded himself to be wary, perhaps he was a ruinous force in disguise,
 an servant of those that would always be evil and would seek to corrupt
 men and everything good and wholesome that he tried to protect from their
 rotting grasp and insidious machinations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, he was just a man, a believer like him, brave enough to seek out
 God.
 He would soon find out whether he should strike him or greet him like a
 brother should.
 He was quite closer by now, and he thought it prudent to make some sort
 of sign, to announce himself properly, like a man in the Holy Land should
 greet a fellow man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped and stood still, and then made the sign of God, touching his
 bowed forehead with one straight palm, offering his other hand, showing
 his clear, empty palm.
 What the gesture meant to those familiar with it, or those of pure mind
 and soul, was: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I am a man blessed with God's gift, a mind of my own.
 I carry no weapon, I am your brother.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man walking towards him slowed his pace, visibly trying to discern the
 gesture.
 Then he responded in kind, first with a deep bow towards the sinking suns,
 then with the same sign, albeit with the opposite hands, mirroring the
 Pilgrim's motion.
 A true believer then, or some instrument of God.
 His blessings were countless, his heart leaped with joy at such a sight.
 A brotherly soul, here in the Land of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim smiled widely, and picked up his pace to meet with his brother
 from afar.
 He could see the man coming towards him smile as well, his face lit up
 with enthusiasm and surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the faint light of the crimson moon they met each other, faces visibly
 ridden with the signs of hardship only a believer would endure to prove
 his love of God, and stay true to his faith.
 Brothers joined by belief, sharing the creation of God, walking on the
 Path.
 What joyous occasion such a meeting of brotherly souls, in the Holy Land
 no less!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were standing opposite each other, and the man in front of him, the
 man who he had seen walking up towards him was younger, leaner, and taller
 than he had glimpsed at first.
 In the light of dusk it was easy to misjudge the shape and size of things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The young man proffered his hand, and spoke a few words in Helican.
 The Pilgrim didn't speak Helican, had actually never heard it before in
 his lifetime.
 He was thinking the man talking in front of him must have uttered a greeting,
 or announced his name.
 He seemed friendly, unassuming and harmless.
 He might be speaking in weird tongues, but he made the sign of God.
 A brother under God's view is brother enough.
 The Pilgrim closed his eyes and nodded with acceptance, hands outstretched
 to his left and right.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim thought it proper to answer in kind, in the tongue of God, even
 if his brother from afar would not be able to understand.
 Indeed, what he said sounded as if it could have been familiar, but no
 sense could be made of it yet.
 Perhaps some common thread could be found while they conversed.

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim look at him puzzled.
 His brother was as excited for their meeting as he was, he could tell.
 But he was so outspoken, so emphatic and energetic.
 He seemed to have forgotten about paying proper respect in the Holy Land,
 his voice loud and his expression wild, his body almost hyperactive, tense
 with motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, he could not understand a single word the man said, even though he
 seemed to have repeated a question at least once.
 He might be asking where I'm coming from, or where I'm going, the Pilgrim
 said to himself silently, absorbed in thought.
 It was difficult to believe this was a messenger from God or one of his
 holy servants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He seemed just a long lost brother, the language he spoke altogether different,
 as so were his customs pertaining to the reverence of God.
 He was quite different, but he hoped he was indeed a brother as he had
 hoped.
 Though he could always be a trap, a machination, an evil thing sent to
 thwart him and his Pilgrimage, to mock God and his divine plan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would not allow himself to fall for such cheap tricks, and his wary eye
 would be on the lookout for signs that would expose this man as a pawn
 of the archenemies.
 For now, he would treat him as a brother, and offer God his prayer, seeking
 forgiveness for thinking such accusing thoughts even in a time that should
 be joyous, for a brother, he hoped, had been found.
 He smiled, and motioned his hands to the sky, head slightly bowed and a
 thin but hearty smile on his lips, his voice clear and true:

And with that, he reached for his sack, and took out a handful of berries
 he had only picked up this morning.
 It would have been his dinner, but knew he now had to offer his brother
 everything he had.
 It was God's way, and it mattered not what he would eat, because God provides.

 in a seemingly timid way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim made the sign of God once more, and looked at the strange man
 he now considered a brother under God, and felt a bit saddened that his
 words could not be understood and his questions, he could not be able to
 answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he was starting to find some common sounds, he had not the wisdom
 of an elder, or the eloquence of their Prime.
 He was just a Pilgrim, and thanked God silently for that preordained fate
 that brought him to the Lands where no one else can go.
 Except, it seemed, this strange new brother of his.

You speak High Helican though, but can't understand the simple, day to day

 And unless you're a minister gone mad, I'd say you're one of the people
 Esphalon wrote about.
 You're quoting, aren't you? You've learned it by rote? Damn fools the lot

 This is getting so much better every day.
 To think I was ready to botch everything a couple of days ago.
 And now this.

\begin_layout Standard
As the man ended his incessantly long phrase, which the Pilgrim thought
 it could contain the man's story, how he came to the Holy Land and why,
 where he was raised and what his people do to live.
 Perhaps he was wrong.
 He offered thanks to God in the end and said a single word he heard clearly.
 He could learn from him then, slowly.
 They still had an unknown amount of distance to travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe God had not sent this man to find him, but he had sent both of them
 to find each other.
 Fate is for God alone to change and decide, but he was thankful he would
 have a companion with him.
 For where else could this man be going, walking on the True Path, other
 than to the Holy Grounds themselves? It was their journey now, the Pilgrim
 thought, and then smiled, carefully pronouncing each syllable slowly, before
 bowing and once again pointing upwards:

With that last sentence, the man laid down on the Path, without a cloak

 But God forgives.
 And it is never too late to ask for forgiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim thought he had been too critical of his brother.
 He seemed weird and acted in a strange way, and his language was not either
 like something he had heard amongst his people or the language of God's

\begin_layout Standard
But he felt it in his heart, this man would become a true friend and brother
 before their journey was through.
 And perhaps, he would learn a quite foreign and alien language.
 Something he had never even thought possible, since he had not known other
 languages existed.
 The thought made the Pilgrim laugh his heart out, a fit of laughter he
 hadn't had since before he had left his people on his Pilgrimage, before
 he was indeed chosen to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His new brother looked in disbelief, somewhat dumbfounded, his hand pointing
 at the laughing figure of the Pilgrim.
 His lack of reverence would have to be punished with at least a hundred

 inside him for too long.
 It was a liberating experience.

Otherwise he would have been going towards the Holy Grounds, not towards

 He must have seen they were on the Path, only going in different directions.

 never came that night to her.
 Her tears flowed freely for the better part.
 She stifled the worst of the sobs and moans that welled up from her insides,
 but still she wept.
 By morning her face was that of an older woman, eyelids swollen from the
 crying and sleeplessness.
 She felt horrible, the child within her seemed equally disturbed.

She had left her windows closed, drapes and curtains tightly drawn shut.
 She cared not whether the suns had risen, and a new day had dawned.
 She wept for her only love, the one half that matter most in the world.
 The other half, his own half as well, was stirring uneasily in her belly.
 She tried to think comforting thoughts but all she managed was to utter
 with a croak:

She pined for the father of her unborn child, to hold him and caress his

 To kiss their fears and troubles away.

 poor Philo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But no body had been found, and none had come for her or her child.
 Philo would never talk, he would never give up his blood brother, his mentor,
 his friend.
 She suddenly felt a pang of fear in her heart, as if it had been struck
 violently, nearly coming to a halt.
 Was the child safe with her? Did she need to run, run like the wind and
 the winter streams? Disappear like she had never existed?

And what about Amonas? What happened to her love? She could not for one

 How tired she had grown of all these dark affairs, so many lies upon lies.
 The lies they had sworn to break and burn away, those very lies were what
 kept them alive, probably.
 What irony, to have had your life built around what you despised most.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the only way, they had kept telling to themselves.
 The only way they could change things once and for all, the only way they
 could spread the truth and uncover the deceit that blinded them all.
 And this was the way he was gone now.
 Perhaps forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dark thought contorted her face into a mixture of anger, pain and weeping
 sorrow.
 She held her head in her palms, sobbing silently.
 She was constantly going through the same phases: Sorrow, then anger, then
 a faint sliver of hope would dawn upon her and recollect her thoughts,
 compose herself somewhat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then fear would grip her once more, uncertainty for her child would
 sweep everything clean, and the vicious circle of gripping emotions and
 harrowing memories of happier times would start anew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And she would weep and cry and throw herself against the walls until she
 could stand it no more; and then she would think of her loved one that
 might be dead and would never live to kiss her again, and hold his child
 in his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then she would weep once more, all the tears of the world coursing down
 her cheeks, like she was amidst the torrent of pain and anguish that ran
 throughout every living thing.
 She would suffer until no one had suffered before, and it would not stop
 until she either died herself, or her love was standing right in front
 her, calling her to his arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The child stirred within, as if it was calling out to her, as if fear had
 touched it deep inside, past the warmth of his mother's belly, and chill
 crept up all around it.
 She tried to soothe her child, and in spite herself started to sing an
 ode to the streams and fields, a song of merry melody, something that would
 have Amonas smiling and laughing within moments.
 She would not cry at the thought, nor think him long gone.
 She would sing it in quiet waiting, and strong hope.
 She would sing it for their child's sake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so she did, and her voice echoed in her empty house, which suddenly
 felt brighter, warm and full of charming smells, like cinnamon and naristhel,
 and lermentis leaves, and honey-spice and mint.
 All those smells that brought the senses joy, and a smile on their face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The child felt quiet now, the singing had relieved it of fear and brought
 back the warmth in its heart.
 It felt like it was asleep now, comfortable in its mother's womb, who herself
 felt soothed, her fears cast away for the moment, her hope shining more
 bright, her heart beating with renewed vigor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her mind was filled with thoughts: He would be alright, Amonas.
 He would be fighting or running all the way back to me, like the lovely
 fool he is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She strolled around the house for a while, thinking that she could not longer
 sit here idle and miserable.
 She had to find out what had happened, see for herself.
 After all, she felt she was not safe sitting here anymore.
 Neither her nor their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It sounded a foolhardy and unnecessarily risky, her mind told her.
 But her mother's instinct shouted that she should run away, find another
 shelter.
 Somewhere where she might give birth as safely as possible.
 She was due anytime soon, each day could be the day their child would be
 born.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her condition made moving all the more difficult so she would require some
 assistance in her endeavor.
 She thought about moving out to the countryside, take what coin she could
 and find some good people, some family to take her in, at least until she
 gave birth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But things were about to get hectic, she knew.
 And soon there would be very few people that she could trust.
 Amonas had chosen to keep her well away from the happenings and goings
 of the Kinsfolk, so she had only met and knew Philo, who was supposed to
 be her guardian and protector should anything happen to Amonas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had been frightened at the thought, but had accepted it as a realistic
 precaution.
 The irony now was that with Amonas missing, and her protector arrested
 she would have to fend for herself.
 Poor Philo, what horrible fate must await him at the hands of those tyrants?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She would have to turn to the Kinsfolk for their help.
 At this time of need, with an uprising boiling right under her feet, the
 child almost on its way, what should she do? Run away, fearing for their
 lives everyday? Never knowing who to trust, with every possibility of war
 raging throughout the territories? No, it would be foolish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She might have been foolish with her own life before, before she was graced
 with Amonas' and her child, but now she would give her all to protect her
 child.
 And this was her best bet, find the kinsfolk before all of Pyr turned into
 a nightmare, and stay with them until this nightmare was ended and a new
 day dawned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For better or for worse, she would be amongst friends, free men and women,
 brothers and fellow believers in the just and right.
 It was time she accepted that there would be nowhere safer than right in
 the heart of things, where the revolution was about to spring out from
 like a restless stream.
 A revolution more like a mad, furious river overflowing with the tears
 of the downtrodden, the poor and wretched, the ones that were made to disappear
 in the middle of the night, their cries haunting the streets like ghosts
 trapped in a hellish afterlife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That knowledge, the knowledge of the deeply rooted injustice, the tyrannical
 masterminds of the Ruling Council, the lies and deceit spread through the
 ministers, all with the same purpose of breeding sterile and harmless minds
 like sheep, all that made her subscribe to Amonas' purpose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She saw the truth behind his words, behind every poor beggar and every blind
 former soldier, every child dying of hunger and every old man hanged for
 blasphemy and sin that no God would allow, if he had anything at all to
 do with the real world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that steeled her, and made her finally decide.
 She would seek out the kinsfolk and actively join them and participate
 in any manner that she could.
 Not just for the safety of her unborn child, but for its future life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She knew then instinctively that Amonas would have been proud for her right
 now.
 Making such a decision.
 Not out of a childish conception of bravery, or duty or a vainglorious
 attempt at posterity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But because she genuinely cared, she actually hoped and wanted their child
 to grow up a free person, not bound anymore, not a cripple in mind or soul,
 but a person free to build his own destiny, free from oppression of the
 spirit, free from misconceptions and prejudice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A person that could think of his own, decide for himself, live in a world
 of endless potential.
 Someone that could dream of reaching out of the stars without fear of being
 damned as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a raving madman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it was a boy, she thought to herself and smiled, she would like him to
 be like his father, but not too much.
 Carve his own destiny, raise a family of his own, set the example to those
 around him, be cherished and loved.
 He could be anything, an artist, a poet or a painter, and he could put
 down on paper and canvas the feelings, emotions and thoughts none had dared
 so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could be a man of reason and logic, and make something useful out of
 things like steamers.
 And think of new, exciting and purposeful uses to make the lives of people
 easier, and carefree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew in the end he would be a wonderful man, just like his father.
 Who he will meet and grow to cherish and love, the man who will help him
 become happy and whole in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She smiled at how she corrected herself even in her thoughts, and bit her
 lip thinking what it would be like if the child was a girl.
 She would be born a free woman, and she would have all the time in the
 world to become what she wished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She could become so many things that would have been unthinkable before.
 She could become the thinker and the tinkerer, and then her baby brother
 the dancer, like his mother.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These thoughts of merry prospect brought her glee and her face shone.
 She could not wait for Amonas' to return.
 She now felt it would be impossible for him to miss the birth of his firstborn.
 She would tell him all about her plans when they met again.
 After she had smothered him with kisses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But first things first, and that blessed reunion would have to wait.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She picked a rather small sack, and carefully picked up some things she
 would either need or would miss terribly.
 Some letters from Amonas, that would also serve as proof he was her husband,
 if it came to that.
 The flute he had carved for her, which she played to him on the colder
 nights, the both of them wrapped together under heavy sheets, playing endlessly
 until the break of dawn, and making love without a care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then a few clothes, her nightgown and a blanket or two, in case she
 had to spent a few nights on the road.
 She packed some leftover bread-pie from yesterday, and remembered to fill
 a flask of water from the well before she would be off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be best not to tell anyone, not even dear Rovenia.
 It would do her no good to upset her and make her worry without being able
 to help in any way.
 Once she was gone, it would not be long before the revolution proper began
 and then no one would be safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be best if she warned her somehow, but what could the poor lady
 do if she knew of the gathering storm? This house was all that she had
 left, no spouse or children to speak of.
 She would stay, Celia thought, whether there was a rebellion going on or
 not.
 Then again, she had proven to be somewhat of a rebel herself.
 Cinnamon bread-pie on a Watchday! An audacious old lady, indeed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her small sack was packed to the brim, ready to burst.
 Outside dusk was falling, but she would wait for the night sky to appear,
 when it would be easier for her to find the men she was looking for.
 She would try some of the places they had met with Philo, some inns and
 some artisan's stalls that stayed open past the usual times, in the corners
 of the market were most avoided because of their ill reputation.
 She would take a large kitchen knife, just for good measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She might not look like it, bloated belly and all, but she could move real
 fast.
 A dancer, a really good dancer like her, has certain qualities that can
 be put in more than one use.
 At that thought she brought up a particularly fond memory, and giggled
 in spite herself, like a little infatuated girl.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, he would be back and she would scold him properly for leaving her alone
 like that.
 A pregnant woman mere days before being due, a world-shattering uprising
 in the works, and the husband, off on a tour!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She suddenly broke down in tears, the tension that had kept her going suddenly
 released.
 The fear and uncertainty did not return, but she felt she should slap herself
 for trying to lose herself in forgetfulness, act is if nothing serious
 was happening, like she could be all play and games when she saw him again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She composed herself and stopped crying, and let the tears down her cheek
 run dry.
 This was all deadly serious, and he might be dead.
 She knew it in her heart he wasn't, but she had already learned life could
 be so full of surprises, and not all of them good.
 So she turned her heart into ice, and gave the thought some possibility,
 which only made her cold and distant from her usual self.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that moment, she took a vow on her life and the life of her child, that
 she would fight in any manner or way possible, for the future freedom of
 her child, and if things were so, in memory of her loving husband, Amonas
 Ptolemy, to honor his legacy and offspring, as he would have wanted so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time passed slowly, and she grasped the opportunity to have a last look
 around their house.
 Their bedroom, were he had loved her with passion and care, sometimes a
 strong lover, unyielding, discovering every inch of her body with a conqueror's
 lust.
 Other times, he was soft, mellow, caring and delicate, like the gentle
 breeze that caresses the flowers and meadows and flows freely wherever
 it pleases, always welcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was here where their child was conceived.
 It must have been one of the coldest nights, when he took her under the
 sheets and made her forget the world existed, in such a way that she could
 not remember now whether it was truth or fantasy.
 The child in her womb though was real enough, his seed taking place well
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was caressing her belly absent-mindedly when she walked through her
 kitchen, the wood stove unlit, the fireplace glum and silent.
 It was as if the room itself mourned her leaving.
 She would miss all the times she would prepare their meals with loving
 warmth, making sure there was always uwe on the table in one or another.
 Amonas

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had been quietly absorbed in thought, her gaze fixed someplace irrelevant,
 when she happened to look outside the street.
 Night had finally fallen.
 It was time she left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She lit up a single candle in their bedroom, at their window sill, as if
 in memory of the time they had spent together, gathered her small sack
 and went outside, careful to close the door behind her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She noticed lady Rovenia must have been outside, because she could see no
 candle lit.
 Perhaps she was already asleep, early to rise, early to bed.
 She thought she should have said goodbye, but it might be for the best
 in the end.
 Her love went out to her as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon she was mingling with the night crowds of Pyr, common pyres lighting
 up the streets and the more lively parts of the market, were stalls sold
 meats and some women sold their bodies.
 One could find anything he desired in the market of Pyr, as long as one
 searched hard enough in the right places, that much she knew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On her way to one of the inns, she noticed she was attracting unwanted attention
; surely it seemed that a pregnant woman should not be walking outside in
 the market all alone.
 She should have thought to somehow cover her belly, accommodate for her
 shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All she could really do now was try and stay in the shadows.
 With one hand she clutched her sack over her back, and with the other her
 solid kitchen knife.
 She felt she was ready for violence, but she couldn't be sure if the need
 did not arise, and she dearly hoped it didn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, she reached one of the inn's she remembered Amonas saying were
 more than sympathetic to their cause.
 It was one of the few places she had seen Philo in public, and when she
 did it was indeed more of a social gathering, a few friends enjoying a
 drink together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed more than strange, in some cases depending on the circumstances
 and the phase of the moon literally a sin, for a woman to have a drink
 amidst the company of men, even with her husband present.
 She thought all that was about to change soon, and entered the inn as any
 client would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the men in the tables nearer to the door turned around and looked
 at her with stout disapproval, some even voicing their objections and threateni
ng to call the procrastinators to make an example of her.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those few left their coin on the table and left in a boisterous but rather
 pretentious manner.
 Most of the others who had protested more mildly returned to their drinks
 which seemed rather more interesting than an unscrupulous woman of probably
 lower moral fiber than their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who did not return to their drinks and kept on pointing, some even
 calling her names, she ignored in an exemplary fashion.
 Soon, they focused their attention on other matters, and her entrance was
 then only memorable in passing.
 She hoped they would all drink up enough to pass out and remember little
 of the matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before she could reach the innkeeper's bar, the man approached her and drew
 her aside by the arm, quietly and gently:

She motioned to her to stand behind his bar.
 He gestured with one hand for her to wait there, and she indulged him so.
 He went around the tables, filling up the cups of his customers with beer,
 wine, mead and spirit, each one to his poison.
 After he had a second look, he leaned over the bar and told her in hushed
 tones, imparting hidden knowledge:

Where you stand, there is a hatch on the floor.

 Wait for me there, I won't be long.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded in acknowledgement and the innkeeper ventured a smile, revealing
 a few bad and broken teeth, and a silver one that must have cost him a
 small fortune.
 Still, it seemed genuine and since she was flying blindly it would make
 little difference if she had went to some other place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She comfortingly thought that any place she would try that night would be
 somewhere she would be treated at least as a friend, and that lifted her
 spirits somewhat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She cast a few guilty looks around as if she was about to try something
 forbidden, and went down on her knees.
 She found the hatch and the small handle, and pulled.
 Faint light was shooting upwards and she could see a small ladder going
 all the way to the cellar floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She threw down her small sack first, and then carefully placed her feet
 on the steps one after the other, her large belly giving her a little bit
 of trouble.
 She was standing in the inn's cellar, and looking around her she could
 see row upon row of glass bottles filled with a variety of wines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then much larger casks and barrels, some smelling of wine, and some
 of beer.
 A metal contraption filled with pipes and resembling a large sort of cauldron
 must have been a still, but she wasn't all that sure about those things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until she had time enough to look around, the innkeeper showed himself,
 coming down the same way she did moments earlier.
 He was a short but sturdy man, thick red mustache and a slightly bald scalp
 giving off a friendly, jovial image.
 He proffered his hand and bowed slightly before introducing himself:

I do not expect to see my brother ever again.
 But do not lose hope on your husband, we have confirmed he and his friend

 Let's make sure my brother gave his life quickly and painlessly, and not
 in vain.
 Come now, please.
 Since we know Philo and Amonas were probably betrayed we must also assume
 you are not safe in the streets.
 If Amonas is still alive, getting hold of you will be one of their priorities.
 I will lead you to somewhere safe, at least for now.

Nevertheless, she was following Rewe's steps through what appeared to be
 a hidden door, cut away in the dirt, a small tunnel of sorts.
 Rewe had produced a torch from some place only he knew where to find in

 small stone.
 Rewe took notice of her surprise and told her kindly:

Amonas thought if it came to that and he was not around, you were quite

 which they might be able to test his loyalties.

She was surprised and felt both proud and slightly put off.
 Amonas would not abandon her or the child like that.
 But she thought, if he could not be there for her, he thought this was
 the best way to protect her, keep her away from it all, as he had from
 the start.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Oh, Amonas, that thick skull of yours..

 cut into the rock, and others finely bored with care and precision.

They must have had been walking for at least a quarter of an hour before
 Celia at length broke the silence and asked:

Celia nodded with acceptance, and they had now reached a crossroads of tunnels.
 Rewe then used the torch as some sort of knocking apparatus.
 He used it to knock on what seemed to be finely cut limestone, in a series
 of rhythmic knocks using pauses in between, as if playing part of a tune.
 Some kind of code, she guessed.

Indeed, a strange kind of challenge sounded, a series of knocks from the
 other side of the limestone.
 Rewe seemed to pause for a while, and then proceeded with a different series
 of knocks.
 The limestone slab was slowly pushed aside, and strong candle light filled
 the underground tunnels.
 A small simple wooden ladder was lowered, and Rewe motioned Celia to climb
 it.
 Silently, he bowed and waved her goodbye before losing himself back the
 way they had come.
 Celia squinted at the bright light as she came up the stairs, onto what
 seemed to be a very plush kind of cellar, with exquisite bronze and silver
 decorations on the walls.
 A whole wall devoted to grand collection of what seemed to be wine bottles.
 A smiling old man in a luxurious servant's suit complete with velvet vest
 was the sole occupant.
 He seemed a rather upstanding and polite man who helped her make the last
 steps up the stairs, offering his hands as support.
 She looked rather mystified at her whereabouts, and as she was ready to
 ask the venerable servant where she was, probably his long experience and
 hard years of service prompted him to greet her before she had time to
 open her mouth:

 The minutiae of a preparation for complete mobilization were indeed innumerable.

All of these, and quite some more kinds of papers and formal scrolls had
 to reviewed, amended if needed, edited, signed, forwarded, then signed
 again and scribed, before sent out in a seemingly never-ending vicious
 cycle of bureaucracy and stale ministry procedures, designed to triple
 check and record everything that went on, making sure nothing seemed to
 stray in weird, unexplored territory that would alarm the various officials
 and by natural order the Arch-minister himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this paperwork and mind-boggling interdepartmental anarchy had the general
 sitting wide-eyed at his desk, papers strewn all over his desk, a carpet
 of ink and white that made his head dizzy merely by looking at it, much
 less reading it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He leaned over and put his elbows on the desk, resting his head on his hands,
 gently massaging it as if that would make the terrible headache go away.
 All this had him thinking about his career in the army in general.
 He somehow wished he could go back in time and almost fail at pretty much
 everything, and get Gomermont's job for a change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead he leaned again back on his chair, the muscles in his back stiff
 from constantly sitting and signing since early dawn.
 His wrist hurt like he had been practicing with a sword since yesterday.
 He looked at the plain and unadorned ceiling, his eyes out of focus, and
 seemed to ponder deeply the state of affairs he was in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The army had been metaphorically, though almost literally at times, handcuffed
 and thrown around like a useful but dangerous idiot for almost ever since
 its inception and creation.
 The hindrances and bureaucratic steps that are constantly battling the
 army and its people are designed in such a way as to extend the period
 of time it takes for troops to assemble, equip and move, from days onto
 weeks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept was thoroughly and widely known as a safety measure against

There had been precedents surely, but that was another time entirely, when

There was bound to be some dissidence, some kind of resistance.
 It was well known that even the earth opposes the river's flow, but the

And so I'm stuck here, he thought, trying to build a machine of war faster

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even with the help from the Arch-minister that had indeed expedited some
 processes, Tyrpledge was experiencing significant delays in most of his
 petitions and requisitions.
 It all had to sift through the gargantuan train of Ministry processes,
 officials and hearings, disappear in its labyrinth offices, clerk pits
 and then back up again through the same path, in order to probably, but
 not always most likely, end up in something useful and tangible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more he thought about it, the more incredulous it all seemed, but it
 was manifestly real.
 The other day, he just remembered, he had received a notice of an annulled
 material request for a shipment of chisels required for the maintenance
 and construction of most of the siege engines.
 The ministry's reasoning behind the annulment was mystifying at best:
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Said objects are still under examination for safety reasons
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed the ministry was contemplating whether or not a military coup
 could put chisels to good use, in preference to the usual swords, scimitars,
 bows, steamers, slingshots, siege engines and the good old knives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their lack of trust was crippling.
 He was given a colossal task that was daily compounded with the burden
 of the ministry's schizophrenic tendencies that balanced precariously between
 gross, outright denial and a maniacal urge to have everything done and
 ready armed merely with ink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arch-minister had been quite unable to help, since this was how everything
 worked and reiterating the jumbling mass of ministry people to adopt new
 sound practices in a matter of days was just as inconceivable as totally
 circumventing the antiquated ministry machine.
 In essence, he was caught between a hammer and an anvil.
 With nowhere else to go, he knew he would have to endure.
 He could feel the pressure though, and it was rising to a crushing level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He got up from his office and decided to have a little stroll outside.
 Maybe some fresh air would invigorate him.
 As he left his office, his aide-de-camp and various other officer belonging
 to his immediate staff saluted crisply, most of them with papers and ink
 in hand, designated to handle some of the bureaucracy whose scale defied
 that of behemoths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He left orders for his aide-de-camp that he was not to be disturbed or communica
ted to in any way while he was out having his walk.
 Anything it was it would have to wait for him, not the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He might not have a vote on the Council, but he didn't like being pushed
 around like a junior officer after 45 years of humble and devoted service.
 It felt wrong, that was the word.
 Plain wrong.
 He reached for someone's mug of fresh uwe and without a nod or excuse just
 picked it up and went outside in the clear cold air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked casually over the throngs of artisans, laborers and soldiers going
 about their frantic work.
 The artisans were terribly busy constructing breakable, portable siege
 engines, refurbishing and testing the steamers that had fallen in prolonged
 disuse.
 Even with the sudden influx of forced skilled and unskilled labor, he could
 easily discern they were behind schedule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the background to the main staging area of the army, laborers were hard
 at work ferrying ore from the nearby Ilo and Rohms mines.
 The mines were working at full capacity non-stop, the noble families that
 were allowed to operate the mines failing to reach the needed production.
 Already, procrastinators teamed up with squads of army men were instructed
 to gang-press as many people as needed to meet the allotted quotas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were less than ten days left before the army was expected to march
 fully armed with the maximum strength of trained men.
 There were still thousands of weapons and pieces of armor to be made, which
 meant more and more ore each day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forges had been setup right here, but artisans were already starting to
 break down from exhaustion.
 Work had been issued to forges and workshops around the Territories, and
 failure to meet the allotted quota assigned to each was punishable with
 death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same went for the grand fields of noble families.
 It was reported that even the Lords themselves, the heads of families,
 were working their own fields, busy to harvest as much grain, wheat and
 fitlle as possible, however premature the season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole of the Territories was living and breathing in preparation of
 the army - everything else had come to a standstill.
 Mills had broken down from excessive speed while grinding endlessly.
 Rumors of some of them catching on fire trying to meet the demands could
 not be far from the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Horses and tract animals of all kinds like cows and donkeys were being taken
 forcibly from their masters, inmost cases the only animal they had to work
 the lands or make a living with.
 Huge convoys stretching from one side of a town to the other were being
 created by local procrastinator forces, and went about the countryside,
 picking up whatever it was on their ministry approved lists, filling up
 cart after cart of supplies and materials for the army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of that wealth was congregated and amassed in even larger convoys that
 stretched from one end of the horizon to the next, filling up the few roads
 that carts could go traverse.
 Some of them had already started arriving at Pyr and the staging area,
 a huge stretch of land to the south of the City, where once the harbor
 of Urfalli with lay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The harbor was made a new, and ships from the farther reaches of the Territories
 should begin arriving in the next couple of days, like the convoys cart,
 laden to the brim with supplies and men, flirting with disaster from being
 overweight and prone to sinking should they happen upon bad weather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Procrastinators around the lands with the authority of the ministers rounded
 up men fit for duty of all ages, those who had received military training
 as militia men in the past, as well as new recruits that could not tell
 the pointed tip of a spear from a moose's behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was happening too fast for comfort, too hastily for any serious preparation
 to be made, plans laid out and understood.
 The people under his command, from the high ranked officers, the colonels
 and brigadiers, to the lowly green recruit, would not have enough time
 to prepare, get their bearings, get to know what their purpose would be,
 their orders and responsibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He hoped first that he could put it all together in time, since failing
 to do that would mean his head.
 He though about that, and it did not frighten or trouble him, not in the
 sense it would most people.
 Of course, it would be more than unpleasant, but he had long accepted that
 he would be asked at some point, sooner or later, to give up his life for
 the glory of the Gods and the Castigator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had just never occurred to him that such a time would come rather later,
 right before he would be rotated to an easier life of teaching young aspiring
 officers.
 And it definitely had not occurred to him that his death might not be because
 of an enemy's spear, sword, rock, arrow or fire, but because of failing
 to meet production quotas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it would more specifically boil down to a lack of chisels.
 The thought brought a bitter smile to his lips, and he sniggered with a
 dark sense of amusement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wished he could have a smoke right now, a nice pipe-blend of uwe, keplis
 and dark tobacco, but he had given up on the habit a long time ago, and
 now lacked all the assorted paraphernalia, as well any sort of tobacco
 to speak of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps a one of his officers would be so kind as to volunteer a pouch and
 a pipe.
 If it came to that he would order him to do so.
 He grinned for thinking like a brash cadet once more, and sipped a hearty
 mouthful of uwe from the cup he had confiscated with authority from one
 of the desks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It tasted horribly.
 Some idiot had let the uwe leaves boil along with the water, and the result
 was a horrible green broth fit only for mules and perhaps sailors.
 He threw the cup altogether and headed back to his offices, his head much
 more clearer but his mood equally, if not more glum than before.
 He made a mental note to himself to reprimand the one responsible for the
 terrible uwe tea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he entered the planning chamber which was filled with his officers,
 he noticed it was completely silent and everyone inside firmly standing
 to attention.
 He thought he had given orders that with such hectic work going on, discipline
 should be lax.
 He couldn't have everyone standing stiff as a corpse every waking minute,
 and the shouts of

 were a cacophony his ears and head could do away with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he gestured them to sit down and go about their work with a simple
 flick of his hand and they did not comply, only then did he notice a figure
 standing in a corner of his office, which happened to turn around and address
 him at that exact moment:

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge bowed deeply by reflex, and though at first he was utterly surprised

 he managed a constrained and somewhat witty answer:

 The Castigator walked outside and the general followed behind, careful
 to observe protocol and keep a proper distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator was keeping his hand tied behind his back, surveying the
 landscape.
 It seemed as if he was enjoying the cold wisps of air sweeping in from
 the south, almost craning his neck in a seeming effort to smell the sea
 breeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a small period of time spent taking in the scenery as if he were a
 visiting tourist, the Castigator spoke, turning to address the general
 face to face.
 His hair was slightly ruffled by the gusts of air that were quite common
 this time of year in Urfalli, and made for good ship-running as well as
 the working of the mills.
 He said to Tyrpledge:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me, General.
 Skip the formalities, and tell me what you really think about all this.
 This campaign.
 It's put a lot of strain on you and your people, hasn't it? And you'd have
 to be a gibbering idiot like the Procrastinator Militant not to question
 my motives for such an operation.
 Who wouldn't want to know what he's going up against, true? Please, Tyrpledge.
 Be unpleasant if you have to be honest.
 I do not consider myself a man easily taken by petty flattery, and neither
 should you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge felt a bit surprised, perhaps even shocked from such a straightforward
 manner.
 It was strange enough when the Arch-minister came to him and extended somewhat
 of a professional courtesy towards him.
 It was more than strange that the Castigator himself, of all people, would
 be so direct in his approach.
 It probably meant things were about to get all too serious, too suddenly
 for comfort.
 His voice was straight and professional, perhaps a bit sullen when he replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

True enough, sire.
 I'm blindly preparing for any scenario and contingency I can think of,
 working everyone to near-exhaustion to have as much as possible ready within
 the allotted time.
 If I may say so, the extend of the mobilization you have requested is simply
 overwhelming.
 There may be a possibility that we will not be ready in time, sire.
 Not completely, not fully.
 I can guarantee a bare minimum of a well-equipped, well-trained and disciplined
 fighting force, but I cannot do the same for the full weight of our armies.
 We are still receiving conscripts and draftees from the villages and towns,
 people that have only worked with shovel, pickax and hoe.
 We need more time, sire.
 Or we will not be able to field our maximum numbers.

 Then he asked, his words coming out with slow deliberateness and heavy

 woke up feeling refreshed.
 He sat up and flexed his arms and legs, all the time his gaze towards the
 direction of the bullhorn.
 It had been a more than pleasant change to find themselves under the shadow
 of the immense structure that seemed to blot out the sun quite effectively
 for the whole area to have a different feeling all together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, the one thing they noticed almost immediately was the different
 climate.
 Instead of the scorching heat and sticky moisture, they felt they could
 have actually been back in their own world, during a hot summer overcast
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heat was much more sensible, and their sleep had felt much more relaxing
 and refreshing than before.
 The moisture was still a bother, but it was not aggravating as much as
 before.
 And there was no night time to worry about chilly wetness brewing through
 their bones.
 It was an almost pleasant, comfortable climate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even the vegetation seemed to be somewhat different.
 The trees for one thing, were visibly smaller, and the canopy above them
 evidently thinner, so even though the shadow let less light inside, the
 canopy was thinner and let more of it through.
 So, lighting conditions were about the same, a twilight of sorts that though
 eerie at times, did not put a strain on the eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The greenery was still lush, but it was as if it had shrank a notch, the
 leaves were smaller, thinner, the stems resembled proper plants instead
 of soft green pipes.
 There was less rotting vegetation on the ground, much fewer dropped leaves.
 It almost felt like a weird forest that could have been somewhere on the
 far away lands of the Territories, like the south where they said plants
 like no other grew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas decided not to go for a little exploratory walk as he had done before,
 so as not to alarm Hilderich a second time.
 And in any way now that they were in the bullhorn's shadow, he knew they
 were on the right track, and all they had to do was keep going in the same
 direction.
 It was a matter of time now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would have to worry about what they would actually do only when they
 got there.
 For now, he was more than content to feel a gentle rush of air, quite a
 novelty in contrast to the non-existent wind in the sunlit parts of this
 place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They hadn't found a source of water like the small trickle of water that
 must have been condensed moisture, running through a jumbled mass of thick
 leaves and a particularly shadowy spot somewhere high above in the canopy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead he thought they could rely on that strange hard-skinned fruit with
 the sweet watery juice inside.
 He could see clusters of the trees at various distances, and a nearby tree
 had even shed some its fruit of its own volition.
 Amonas thought they would probably be most ripe and quite sweet, if trees
 worked like they did back home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word even though only uttered in his mind, brought his thoughts to a
 halt.
 He looked at the ground reflectively, a fleeting sadness visible on his
 face.
 It was not just that he longed to see Celia again, even though they had
 not been apart for more than a week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the worrisome feeling of being unable to protect her that wore him
 down.
 He had told his kinsfolk to keep their distance from her, even if something
 happened to him and he would be unable to be there for her.
 More so, especially if something happened to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As luck had brought things about, he was far away, out of reach, with no
 means to communicate that he still drew breath.
 His people would probably think him dead, or running for his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But with each passing day with no sight or sound of him, no message left
 behind, without some kind of proof, they would silently accept the fact
 that he might not have escaped the clutches of the tyrants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If he was being kept alive, reason would dictate that they'd somehow manage
 to know, and perhaps hope he would still be alive when the uprising began
 in earnest, which would be pretty soon, a matter of days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But men had been known to complete vanish before, men that had attracted
 the ire and viciousness of the ruling scum that still chose to wear the
 facade of divinely appointed men of honor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was just one man after all.
 He would not hold it against them if they already believed him dead, drowned
 at the bottom of a lake or river, butchered and fed to wild boars or roaming
 dogs.
 They had seen it happen before, they all knew the dangers and the ignominious
 ways the Patriarch and the Castigator chose to dispose of their enemies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he could not bear the thought of lovely Celia thinking him forever lost,
 never to return her trusting gaze, never more to hold her when the nights
 were cold.
 How did she take the news? What did she make of them? Was she drowned in
 sorrow, her spirit broken?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He never thought of her as a fragile thing, a snowflake that melt by touch
 alone.
 She was not a little woman, a hapless gal.
 She never did mind her own business, and she always spoke her mind.
 She was proud of her accomplishments, and knew her strengths and weaknesses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was though what he feared most.
 He was one of her few weaknesses, now that he was gone.
 He felt a knot in his stomach, at the thought of her giving up, burying
 him alive with that little ritual they buried their dead kinsfolk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could picture her, dancing to the tune of a weeping song in his memory,
 and then losing herself in the hills and fields, roaming the lands.
 Until her days became unbearable, the thought and memories crushing her
 like a millstone crushes seeds, grinding them to oblivion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, he thought, a sparkle erupting in his heart, his gaze shooting upwards
 through the canopy toward the uncaring, seamless sky.
 She was with child, she would try and burn the world itself before anything
 happened to their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She would come through this, she would endure.
 Even if the thought of his death weighted her down, she would find a way
 to use it as a focus.
 She might even go as far as thinking of avenging him.
 She was a fierce woman, he knew.
 She would be a terrible force to behold indeed, as a mother, and a grieving
 wife.
 He would definitely not want to get in her way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thought made him grin with a sense of pride and amazement, as well as
 renewed optimism.
 He thought to himself that since she would be fine, he had no reason not
 to do as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He decided to rouse himself into action, and started off towards the fallen
 hard-skinned fruit he glimpsed earlier, when a sound like a man desperately
 gasping for air mixed with what reminded him of creaking wooden hulls of
 ships, made him pause in his stride and turn around to the source of the
 cacophony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Hilderich and nothing more, awaking with a clatter and a show that
 Amonas had never thought possible, even more so in their current circumstance,
 without even a blanket in hand.
 Still, Hilderich somehow managed to give off the impression of someone
 who had been very violently and quite against his wishes woken during a
 lusciously promising dream after a night of heavy drinking.
 And all that with only soil and fallen leaves under him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas waved a hand and boosted his voice just for good measure before asking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nice of you to join the ranks of the living once more.
 Going to get us some of those sweet-water hard-skins, care to look for
 anything else while I'm at it before we move on?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich yawned with his mouth forming an impossible angle.
 For just a moment Amonas thought his jaws would fall out of place and his
 skin snap in a horrible way, blood and bone spurting forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thankfully that did not come to pass, but he was still mesmerized by the
 way Hilderich's mouth could stretch.
 He still didn't know Hilderich as much as he wanted to, but he knew that
 he was a man indeed full of surprises.
 It's not that he didn't trust him or felt wary of him.
 It was just that he made him go wide-eyed with surprise at the most curious
 of places.
\end_layout

Ehm? Hrm.
 Ah, the hairy brown ones you mean.
 The brown ones.
 That'll do as an appellation until I can sort it properly.
 Yes, I'll be fine with a brown one to quench my thirst.
 I slept wonderfully, thank you, almost better than back at the keep.
 Bad case of insect infestation.
 Never mind.
 Oh, and some food wood be most appreciated.
 I believe I can get the fire going.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, Amonas picked up a brisk pace and walked off into the distance,
 not needing to hack his way through the much less dense vegetation.
 Hilderich languidly got up, his gaze flicking all around him, looking for
 an inviting bush or hopefully a bunch of fallen branches somewhere nearby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich rested his hands on his waist and surveyed the landscape around
 him.
 He would inevitably have to engage in a wider search than what he could
 merely browse just by standing there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he set off as well into the direction of what looked like a promising
 cluster of older-looking trees, their bark craggy and moss-laden, happily
 whistling a tune he could not possibly remember what it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas seemed to be well-versed in surviving skills and at ease with finding
 his way through this remarkably chaotic mess of a forest.
 Hilderich on the other hand knew his own limitations in orientation, which
 had failed him more than once even in the simple confines of his master's
 keep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he used what he thought was a quite practical way of keeping track of
 his whereabouts: he took off his cloak and cloth shirt and hanging the
 white linen shirt on tall yet thin green stalk, he decided he would stray
 only as far as he could keep an eye on his shirt.
 Unless he went blind or some mysterious lurking thief of the wild came
 along and stole his linen shirt, he felt safe enough to wander away in
 search of some hopefully less than soggy firewood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Amonas came back with his sack filled with various edibles, he was
 surprised to see Hilderich naked from the waist up, sitting next to a few
 piles of wooden branches and bulkier logs sorted by size as far as he could
 tell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was sitting idly, his back propped up against the trunk of a tree,
 legs sprawled nonchalantly.
 He looked expectantly at Amonas sack and said in a casual manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What took you so long?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas put the sack down, laughed cordially and began picking up wood from
 the piles to build a fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it was time to move on again, their heart, especially Hilderich's was
 not in it.
 The pleasant environment in combination with their stuffed bellies was
 a major disincentive to even stand up and stretch, much less start hiking
 again in a brisk pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the ground was totally flat, the only variations in height coming
 deceivingly from the various degrees of thickness in vegetation, it was
 still an activity that required some degree of energy and patience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, all their energy seemed to be drained from the need to digest.
 They had indeed enjoyed a small feast: brown ones, some other green horn-like
 fruit with soft sweet flesh, as well as something that resembled wheat
 in taste and form, but was over-sized and purple in color.
 And then some other kind of crisp fruit, red flesh in the inside, wonderfully
 juicy and marvelously mellow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Hilderich displaying genuine culinary audacity, mixing various fruit-stuffs
 together and roasting them in small leaf parcels, they had indeed made
 the best of what Amonas had come up with, which was surprisingly, and thankfull
y, quite a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas had joked about how sorry he was for having been unable to find the
 pack of boars for which the piles of wood had been amassed.
 Hilderich had insisted that Amonas had been gone for quite some time and
 it was perfectly logical that having nothing much else to do, he would
 have kept picking up more wood if he hadn't felt stiff by the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They thought about it and thought it would be better for them to let their
 stomachs do some work first before they set off, so they talked at length,
 something which in the short time they had known each other, they had not
 found an opportunity for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they lied down around the embers of the fire, hands behind their heads,
 comfortably peering through the canopy of the forest wherever they could,
 invariably seeing not a wisp of cloud, more by habit rather than curiosity
 or expectancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich talked about his curator's apprenticeship and master Olom.
 Amonas shared his memories from a time that seemed remote now, when master
 Olom was a close visiting friend of his father's, when he had not become
 shunned by most Curator's and practically forced to live as a recluse,
 and a hermit, rather than an esteemed member of the Curatoria Prefecta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich had been surprised to know that Olom was in fact a gin connoisseur,
 and Amonas even remembered he had brought a distill of his own as a gift
 once.
 He somehow thought better of the old man now, though saving his life as
 he did seemed to have been reason enough to like him immensely, even right
 before he died.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich asked politely about Celia, having seen Amonas' reading some of
 her letters, but Amonas was somehow reticent.
 He apologized to Hilderich saying that it was not an appropriate time for
 such a discussion, but promised him though that he would be more than happy
 to introduce her to Hilderich when they both got back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, and after a time period of grace that Amonas seemed to be less
 than averse about, and once they both felt they could do so without pain
 and anguish from bellies about to burst open, they started off towards
 what Amonas had declared as the proper direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a while, Amonas was showing signs of uneasiness, stopping every once
 in a while, trying to feel the brush of air.
 He craned his neck, as if the air had a strange scent, something intangible
 but yet evident all around them.
 Hilderich could not smell anything out of the ordinary, or feel something
 out of place.
 He noticed though at some point while they were walking, a tingling sensation,
 some the hair in his back and hands rising as if a chill had settled in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich asked Amonas about it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You are uneasy.
 Even I can tell.
 What is the matter?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Amonas puzzlement showed in his voice.
 He was hesitant, reticent, as if looking for the right words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I feel..
 Weird.
 I cannot put it words.
 Nothing specific.
 But, there's something in the air.
 I cannot tell for certain.

 Wrong.

You don't feel it? A reek of sorts.

 It makes me nervous, I'll admit.
 You have felt nothing wrong? Nothing different?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich shrugged, and motioned with his shoulders in uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing as in the way you put it.
 Nothing intense.
 I did notice my hair rising slightly from time to time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, this is not because of a chilly breeze, Hilderich.
 There's something about the place.
 The sense grows stronger the closer we are getting to the bullhorns.
 Keep a wary eye and mind.
 This place might not be as pacified and indifferent to us as it seems.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded thoughtfully in acknowledgement and asked Amonas with some
 anxiety in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you think we are in danger? Of the immediate kind? Someone following
 us? Waiting to ambush us or something of the sort?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas sighed and resumed walking, his pace not as energetic as before,
 his gaze darting around him, watching for something he felt like he wouldn't
 be able to see until it was too late.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich pulled his cloak tighter in an instinctive motion, as if it could
 protect him, ward him from anything that might be wandering or lurking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, even with their slowed down pace and their almost paranoid wariness
 wearing down their minds, they finally reached the base of the bullhorns.
 They could visibly tell because the vegetation thinned out to small bushes
 and insignificant groves abruptly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the hazy background they could indeed see a wall of sorts engulfing their
 field of vision.
 Once they were past the last few trees and plants, a trench of sorts lay
 there, mossy but clearly man-made, clear-cut lines and angles defining
 it, not deeper than the height of a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And beyond the trench, was where the bullhorns front face dominated the
 horizon, defying the senses in a matter none of them thought possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed gigantic, blocking out the sun with ease.
 To their left and right, all they could see was the wall of the bullhorns
 as far human vision allowed, the horizon visibly incapable of containing
 it., an immaculate black mat wall, its appearance obsidian like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed to be shaped like a huge mount, wider at the base and narrow on
 top, like a solid triangle of sorts, a tetrahedron master Olom would call
 it, Hilderich thought quietly.
 It seemed as if it was painstakingly constructed of small bricks or blocks
 of whatever material it was built from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wall face rose with a small inclination, the blocks forming steps that
 seemed to be possible to climb with some difficulty because of their dimensions.
 The huge horns could be seen further higher and farther away, sitting majestica
lly atop a tall summit that could easily be as high as any mountain of the
 outer Territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas urged Hilderich onwards.

\end_layout

Oh, more than ever.
 But this is what we have been walking for all this time.

 wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Can we even pretend we might be able to? I mean, look at it.
 An immense megalithic structure in the middle of a huge exotic forest.
 Not to mention that it is not unique and there many more like it, probably
 innumerable from what we've seen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich seemed troubled, perhaps a bit scared as well.
 Amonas thought it was more than normal and perhaps wise considering their
 situation, but he cast aside his own doubts and concentrated on appeasing
 Hilderich's fears, appealing to his logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Even grains of sand in a beach can be counted, if one has enough time and
 is dedicated enough.
 Focus at what's in front of you Hilderich, don't fret over things we don't
 have to care for immediately.
 And where is your analytical thinking? How do you know it's made of stone?
 You said megalithic.
 If it was obsidian, it would have some shiny quality, wouldn't it? This
 looks quite different.

It's a wall, Hilderich.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' voice was mockingly serious, meant to relax Hilderich's doubts and
 make him focus on finding out as much as they could about this unreal structure.
 He definitely needed Hilderich's clear and precise thoughts, not a muddied
 assortment of insecure comments, defeatist thoughts and morose attitude.

I never thought I could be displaced in a place with one sun and no nights

Amonas held out both of his hands and touched the block of stone that stood
 right in front of him, the first line of steps leading to the bullhorns
 summit.
 Nothing happened.
 Amonas smiled to Hilderich disarmingly, to which Hilderich nodded unenthusiasti

Now that the walls are safe, what do you think we should do? Any thoughts
 on what this thing is? A monument of some sort? Should we try and walk
 around it, find an opening or an entrance, if there is one? Or should we
 climb up to the summit, to where the bullhorns are?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas had pretty much laid out their options quite concisely at that point,
 but Hilderich was still skeptical, one hand scratching at his three-day
 old beard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Walking around it would take a couple of days, my guess is.
 We'd be searching for something we assume might exist.
 I don't know.
 The other thing is that this wall face is shadowed, but the others can't
 possibly be, not with just one sun, one source of light.
 That means we would be scorched dry with all that sun and nothing much
 in the way of making ourselves a shade.
 So, I have to conclude that the only viable course of action at this point
 is indeed to climb up the summit.
 We could try and search this wall from edge to edge, but I don't know what
 might come of it.
 Quite possibly nothing.
 Whoever built this thing would be indeed quite an eccentric if any door
 would be cryptically lying in an obscure, random position.
 But that's just my guess, and not a very educated one.
 All I have to base my conjectures upon is rudimentary knowledge of common
 practices and some plain old good sense.
 But all that on a different world.

Convinced we're in another world then? That the Pantheon is a tale for condition

That's entirely another issue.
 I am convinced that we are in another world because of this damn sun and
 all the trouble I've had the displeasure of enduring in this place.
 But I've seen nothing so far that proves the Gods don't exist and everything
 we've based our society on is a lie.
 There are some lies involved, certainly, but I would be hasty to reach
 such a conclusion of perhaps catastrophic consequences and implications.
 Besides, I'm just a Curator, and only because of chance and the edicts
 of the Curatoria Prefecta.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 intone the name of the society of Curators in which he belonged now, by
 right of his master's untimely death.

Believe me when I say there was no chance involved in your master's death.

 It seems to be connected to the bullhorns.
 As if they exuded some sort of aura.

And with that last remark, once Hilderich had folded his cloak neatly, Amonas
 began their long, effortful climb up the steps of the bullhorn's base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had started their walk a few towards the bullhorns a few hours ago,
 but the walk was easier than before and less demanding, so even Hilderich
 felt he could go on for a few hours more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The large blocks of jet black though cleanly cut and smoothly finished,
 as if from fine porcelain, offered enough friction for a man unused to
 climbing to be able to push himself upwards.
 Hilderich felt it was somewhat like reaching for the top shelf of a cupboard.
 Child's play then, he thought, only somewhat much more taxing on the body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed only after a little more than a hundred steps, Hilderich felt cramps
 and stiffness overtaking his aching body, especially the legs where he
 put much of his strength in to propel himself upwards on the large blocky
 steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas noticed and motioned for Hilderich to take a breath for a while,
 relax his muscles, stretch, and breathe.
 Hilderich's lungs were starting to burn, but he hadn't complained.
 Just as long as they'd made some progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He peered over at the landscape stretching behind them, trying to make out
 where they had originally arrived, where they started their trek from,
 but he was unable.
 It all looked uniformly green and jarring, trees after trees after trees,
 a green sea under a green sun.
 Amonas was standing a few steps above Hilderich, looking thoughtfully at
 the steps behind them.
 At length, while Hilderich was stretching, feet dangling over the steps
 below, he said with a hint of worry in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know, I counted the steps up so far.
 You seem to be jaded.
 I cannot say I'm not tired either.
 The problem is I've counted one hundred and seventeen steps.
 If you look at the summit does it look any closer to you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Amonas pointed at the summit of the bullhorns, without looking directly
 at them, but rather looking at Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Uhm..
 I'm not very sharp-eyed, but I'd say not at all.

Yes we are.
 I don't know if we should go back down ant forage some more before coming
 up again.

 And we'll need some food with all the effort we're putting.

Luckily for you I've kept a brown one and a couple of those horn-shaped
 soft-flesh fruit.
 They should do until then, with a little bit of economy on our part.
 I dread to think I climbing up this monster so I would have to go back
 and forth each time I felt hungry or thirsty.
 And after all, if there's nothing important up there, something like that
 pillar of light that brought us here, then we'd be stuck here, wouldn't
 we? We'd have all the time in the world to go searching for new exotic
 fruit then, I wouldn't worry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's tone was ironic, even caustic, but Amonas thought bitterly that
 he was right.
 If their climb did not bring them closer to home, then nothing else would.
 At least not in any foreseeable future.
 He wouldn't have to worry about provisions then.

\begin_layout Standard
And so they started off to the summit, prepared to only stop for some breathe
 and relaxation, careful not to push their bodies beyond their limits.
 They climbed slowly but steadily, sweat pouring from the pores in their
 skin.
 The higher they went the more they could feel the existence of the wind,
 sometimes a gentle breeze, other times a rough gale.
 The warmth of the air varied, sometimes hot as it was below on the ground,
 other times chill as they had never felt it before here, under this sky
 with its single sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They stopped when they needed to, and moved on when they felt their legs
 and lungs could go on.
 But the higher they went and the more time passed, it became more and more
 difficult to climb and their pace dropped considerably, their pauses increasing
ly frequent and more prolonged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they had made good progress.
 They could see the bullhorns clearly now, rising as majestically as ever,
 indeed towering over them, dominating the sky above.
 But they had still some way to go before they reached the summit proper,
 and those last few steps seemed to put weights of lead on their legs and
 pour fire in their lungs with every breath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed as if they wouldn't make it and actually stop shy of the summit,
 forever perched on a jet black step of the bullhorns.
 But, with grudging determination, and the constant urging of Amonas to
 ignore the pain that made even breathing quite a daunting task, they finally
 reached the last step, and the summit lay all around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Panting from the exertion and the toll put on their lungs, they sprawled
 themselves on the surface of the summit which was similar, but not entirely,
 to the blocks of black material they had been climbing on for what must
 have genuinely been hours on end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a few minutes they lay there, doing nothing but squinting at the ever-presen
t sun, and breathing deeply, trying to get their lungs to work normally
 again.
 They felt almost unable to move their legs, and their whole upper body
 was stiff from the tension and the aggravated efforts to reach the top.
 They had succeeded, but that had left them drained and exhausted, staggeringly
 so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was the first of the two to stand up with visible effort and strain,
 and try and walk about the summit, a large terrace from which the horns
 themselves sprouted from on either side, one of them casting a permanent
 shadow on the wide mat black surface.
 He grabbed Hilderich by one shoulder as he still lay down, seemingly ready
 to fall asleep, and roused him to action once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, Hilderich.
 A last bit of effort.
 Let's stand at the shadow over there.
 It's a bit of a walk, but I promise, you can sleep later on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich moaned audibly, expressing both the fatigue that had overtaken
 him as well as his reluctance to even lift his head in protest, much less
 walk someplace in the state he was in.
 But to Amonas' surprise, evident in the furrow of his brow, Hilderich managed
 to pull himself together and stand up, though with pain written all over
 his face, and creaking and crackling noises coming from his joints, bones,
 and muscles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, they reached the base of the shadowed horn, where Hilderich let
 his body almost go limp and fall on the surface, uncaring of its hardness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas sat himself down with less violence, and noticed that Hilderich had
 not hurt himself in any way by his fall, or did not seem to feel any pain.
 At least not greater pain than the one he already was in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas then spoke with a weary, yet friendly voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Finally, we've reached the summit.
 And there's shadow to rest under.
 I'd try and look around for what we can find, but we're both exhausted.
 I think we should rest properly first.
 The place won't go away under our feet right away now, will it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas grin, as well as anything he said at that point was useless.
 Shortly after he finished his sentence, he heard Hilderich snore in his
 usually loud and unworried way.
 He then knew Hilderich must have really overworked himself getting up here.
 He felt Hilderich was warming to himself and by inference to their cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But maybe he just wanted to get back as badly as he did.
 To what was Hilderich coming back though? All he had left was a promise
 to master Olom.
 Find the Stoneforger.
 Did such a person even exist, or was it as so many other things had been
 proven to be, just a myth? He'd have to see for himself to believe it.
 Amonas felt like sleeping as well.
 His body craved it, and his mind told him he could more than use some right
 now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before he laid himself to sleep on the hard surface of the summit, he picked
 Hilderich's cloak, unrolled it and threw it over him.
 He had no intention of nurse-maiding him all the way back home, however
 little or long it would soon prove to take them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he had taken care of Hilderich's meager comfort, he turned to face
 the other bullhorn, closed his eyes and before even he could think to himself
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this whole world must be huge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, he had fallen soundly asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first one to notice the vibrations was Hilderich.
 He woke up suddenly, as if emerging from a fitful sleep, a nightmare instead
 of a dream.
 He could feel a throbbing sensation coursing through his body, very much
 unlike a headache or some other pain of the senses.
 It was a deeply mechanical sensation, as if the very air was vibrating.
 As he stood upright, senses on the edge waiting for the next sign of impending
 disaster, he could feel his teeth clatter upon each other involuntarily.
 He woke up Amonas immediately by rather indelicately kicking him in the
 ribs where he lay.
 Amonas was sluggish coming around when the whole surface underneath them
 lit up like a miniature sun lay within it, a bright white light underpinning
 their figures.
 The throbbing became a more audible trembling, a deep rumbling feeling
 that seemed to come from way underneath.
 His surprise alerted his reflexes and with a sudden and deft move he was
 on his feet, his head turning in all directions, trying to establish some
 sort of enemy direction to no avail.
 Hilderich spoke hurriedly to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Something's happening.
 This place suddenly came alive.
 We have to do something quickly.
 This might be our chance! I suggest you start looking around.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was still a bit drowsy from his sleep and slow to react, but he eventuall
y nodded in acknowledgement and visibly a little flabbergasted from what
 was going on around him, he asked Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Our chance for what? What are we looking for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anything! Anything at all is better than nothing! A lever, a button, a piece
 of tile sticking out, a mark, a sign, a sigil, a symbol! Anything that
 could be used as a control, anything that might react to a human touch!
 Anything you can find that's not just sleek, or black or both.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich left Amonas standing there trying to picture in his head what
 he would be exactly looking for and walked away towards the center of the
 surface, while at the same time the rumbling grew louder and the light
 stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich though in a frantic state, and not in complete control of his
 thoughts and actions, certainly far from being cool-headed and analytical
 in such moments, still had a knack of noticing things that stood out.
 The blemishes, the one piece that didn't quite fit, the important bits.
 So, after a quick look of the bullhorns themselves, his mind was now working
 in a sort of slowed down time, where every scene in front of his eyes could
 be slowed down almost infinitely, brought to a crawl.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There, in a bubble of time, or a heightened state of mind, he would find
 what seemed important, come up with theories about its existence and role,
 its properties and characteristics, then start eliminating what didn't
 fit or was not as probable, and in the end come up with a solution to a
 problem, or a keen insight that would prove to correct and to the point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then his mind would resume its normal operation so he would be capable of
 speech and most other things considered useful and indeed necessary for
 basic survival.
 It was something that he had caught with the corner of his eye, and had
 pretty much arrived to a conclusion about its significance before he could
 turn around and yell to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lie down! Now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas' reflexes were much better than Hilderich's and he had the clarity
 of mind not to question people when they instructed him to cover himself,
 or avoid something, since they usually did so with the intended purpose
 of saving your skin.
 His body moved almost of its own volition and he let himself fly towards
 the hard surface of the bullhorn's summit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did so, his eyes caught a glimpse of what must have been nothing less
 than fiery death.
 He was barely able to see a giant ball of fire hurtling itself with blinding
 speed towards them, towards this particular bullhorn.
 There was a silvery quality about the fire, and as it came over through
 the bullhorns beyond, he could barely make out Hilderich trying to throw
 himself flat against the bullhorn closes to him in a fashion that would
 seem rather comical in a different situation.
 The flaming apparition was just passing the last bullhorn before Amonas
 instinctively closed his eyes as if that would make it go away, and that
 was the last thing he saw for what appeared to be eternity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He only opened his eyes after the terrible sound of the sky tearing itself
 apart with the force of ten thousand cannons or more had passed, when he
 could breathe once more, when the scorching heat wave above him was come
 and gone again in less than a flash of thunder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought he had gone deaf, since he could hear himself getting up, but
 the sense of sound slowly returned, though his ears ringed like his head
 had been turned into a living bell.
 It hurt like something had ran him over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He checked around to see Hilderich, and found him lying on the black surface,
 trying to move or perhaps stand up but he seemed quite visibly as shaken
 as he was himself.
 But he was alive.
 Whatever that thing was, they were alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had come and gone like a God of thunder, Amonas thought.
 It was strange that he would think in such terms, but he had no alternative
 to express himself by.
 Whatever all that was, it was indeed as they had been nearly smitten by
 a fiery, God of thunder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He offered his hand to Hilderich to help him up to his feet, which Hilderich
 took without second thought, dazed and flabbergasted.
 As he did so, his gaze was fixed towards the direction of the fireball
 that had nearly killed them.
 Hilderich just stood there transfixed, looking out as if waiting for that
 thing to come around and finish them, as if they had been marked for death
 and this was just their executioner calling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked worried and held Hilderich by his arms, trying to attract
 his attention, calling out his name, asking him what was the matter.
 But Hilderich could only afford a mere flick of his gaze, the rest of him
 steadily fixed on the far side of the horizon, across the row of bullhorns
 from where the flaming thunder had passed over.
 Hilderich then spoke, mesmerized, grave seriousness in his every word:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That thing is the answer.
 We have to ride it, somehow.
 I've never thought anything could go that fast.
 It came and went in two blinks of an eye.
 Can you imagine that? Yet it just passed over our heads.
 Like a tamed star, made to fall forever.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked over the same direction Hilderich was, and then looked bitterly
 back at Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It nearly killed us my friend.
 And you would ride it? You called me a madman before.
 I think it's time I returned that remark.
 Whatever that was, it's not made of nature and it's not something we can
 use.
 We have to think of other ways.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There are no other ways.
 There is nothing but wild green lush forest with mushrooms and brown ones,
 and this.
 These bullhorns.
 All these bullhorns only seem to exist for what just passed overhead.
 It went through and through each of these bullhorns, like a cart on rails.
 Whatever it's headed, it can't be worse than this.

\begin_layout Standard

Still, if all that stands to reason, if this was indeed built only to accommodat
e that huge fireball, what makes you think we can ride on it? With it, inside
 it, whatever would make some kind of sense.
 Don't you see how incredibly powerful it is? What are we going to do? Catch
 it with a rope and hang on to it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich grinned and the effect on Amonas was for the first time totally
 disconcerting, perhaps even chillingly terrible.
 He thought the effect of the fiery ball on Hilderich was the loss of his
 wit and mind.
 As these thoughts made a deep frown appear on his face, Hilderich spoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You thing I'm losing it, don't you.
 You think I just went crazy, broke down, my mind left me forever and so
 on.
 But I know we can ride on that thing.
 And I also know that it was designed for that specific purpose.
 Do you want me to explain the reason why or do you think you can come to
 the same conclusion yourself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas shoulders sagged, and he took on an expression of pity, looking at
 Hilderich sorrowfully, as it was the last time he saw him, as if his mind
 had parted with him forever and he was talking to another man entirely.
 Hilderich laughed at Amonas' look:

Well if it, the building, the bullhorns, this world, the fiery thing, wanted
 us dead, I believe there would have been no warning.
 Unless it's part of a well played sport, it doesn't make sense.
 What does make sense though is that the signs appealed to almost every
 sense: Sight, hearing, touch.
 Now that I come to think of it, I could even taste something like copper
 in my mouth, and smell something too.
 Not sure I knew the smell, but something smelled different alright.

 corridors of the Disciplinarium were enigmatically silent.
 Lord Ursempyre Remis was escorted by a pair of procrastinators, at the
 behest of the Patriarch himself, he had been told.
 The mere thought of that man made him uneasy, and now he had been summoned
 personally.
 His mind raced with conjecture and possible reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As his steps echoed in the stone floor of the hallways that never seemed
 to end, he thought he had a pretty good idea of the Patriarch's intentions.
 He thought that perhaps the Patriarch knew, but he had to know for himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See it in my eyes, Ursempyre thought.
 He would play along his role to whatever end might await him.
 This was a critical point.
 Everything hang in a precarious balance, and this was the push that could
 tip things over either way.
 He calmed himself, emptied his mind and held to just one conviction: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am Lord Ursempyre Remis, Noble Representative, Duke of the Fief of Wir
 and Prefect of Urfall.
 I serve the Law and the Pantheon, I abide to the rulings of the Council
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That would be the only thought coursing in his mind, and he would make-believe
 if he had to.
 And if things came to that, he had prepared for other contingencies.
 He merely hoped there was time enough, that things would not be rushed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They passed through many hallways, some of them exquisitely decorated with
 hand-woven tapestries of a beautiful, delicate, and quite extravagant nature.
 Others were bleak, strictly functional and indifferent, not destined to
 impress or provoke awe.
 Probably hardly ever seen or used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As if he had not been summoned here officially.
 Indeed, the procrastinators seemed eager enough to take him by force if
 he had resisted.
 Would the Patriarch be so rash? Would he suddenly arrest him without good
 reason? Certainly he had the power to do so, but was it to his best interest?
 How could he ever succeed in finding out what drove the Patriarch?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man was a terrifying mystery, an uncanny wildfire people tried to steer
 away from.
 The kind of fire that only consumed, and never warmed or lit.
 He was probably the most dangerous man Ursempyre could hope to face, even
 more dangerous than the Castigator, who might be a tyrant and heartless
 man, a man that cared for naught but power and its exertion over men, but
 he was still a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His motives could be understood, some of his actions anticipated.
 Perhaps he could be reasoned, to the extent that it would seem to him to
 be in his best interests, perhaps offering him a deal he could not refuse.
 But, the Patriarch was a blank, as if totally heedless of the circumstances,
 the dynamics of power play and indeed the workings of the world around
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It felt like he had an agenda no one could hope to fathom, an agenda he
 had no intention of altering or suspending.
 He was relentless in whatever pursuit he was involved in, and once you
 laid eyes on him, he looked back.
 It was an eerie feeling, him knowing you were watching.
 It made one think that this man could read your mind with a glance, know
 your fears, your weaknesses, the things that made you cry and the things
 that made you laugh.
 It was as if he was a chilling, unnatural force that could bore right into
 your soul and leave you empty, a walking hulk, your mind and soul gone,
 his own at a mere whim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre shuddered at these thoughts visibly.
 One of the procrastinators noticed and sniggered scornfully.
 Ursempyre turned to look at what could easily be a common thug in the streets
 of Pyr, and stared at him intently, a hint of suppressed wrath in his gaze.
 The procrastinator lost his grin, and stared away, averting his eyes.
 He would remember that face, Lord Remis thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Night had only just fallen outside, and servants could be seen running about
 the Disciplinarium, lighting up braziers and chandeliers where appropriate.
 Halls, corridors, and chambers were being lit up one by one, staff and
 officials grinding on at whatever kind of work that needed to be done during
 these times of war preparations, work that would probably keep them up
 all night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went past the administrative areas, through small warehouses and store
 rooms.
 Lighting was at a premium in these parts of the Disciplinarium, only a
 few torches spread thin, darkness and lighting exchanging places with one
 another at uneven intervals.
 One of the procrastinators paused and unhitched a torch from its post to
 carry along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were descending deep down in the lower levels of the Disciplinarium,
 places that Ursempyre had always been loathe to visit, for he was aware
 of the acts usually being performed in these levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kept hidden from prying eyes, this was the place where the enemies of the
 state, the sinners and the ones considered dangerous and unruly were brought
 to be chastised and enlightened.
 His face grimaced at the euphemism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chastisement and enlightenment came at the price of torn fingernails, pried
 tongues and flogged backs.
 And then there were those who utterly disappeared, the dungeons of the
 Disciplinarium their last murky, cold abode.
 Oh, he knew what was coming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would be thoroughly interrogated by the Patriarch himself.
 The die was cast, it seemed.
 There was nothing more he could.
 He hoped he would be able to escape with his life, but if it came to that,
 he had made arrangements.
 Everything would be put in motion if the hours passed without him emerging.
 It was all planned and primed, ready for what was in the end, only inevitable
 and long ago decided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uprising would begin.
 These thoughts seemed bitter and morose, unfitting of his determination,
 his purpose.
 He would try and beguile the Patriarch, a task that genuinely seemed desperate,
 but he would.
 And if he failed at that, he would endure as long as he could, until his
 body failed him, until his mind and soul were utterly crushed.
 He had no misgivings, no fantasies of standing against the Patriarch for
 too long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew not what tools of torture he used, but he knew that none had been
 left unbroken.
 Those that he touched, they all gave up in the end.
 They all talked, they all begged for their lives like lesser men, like
 cornered animals, their instincts making a last attempt at salvation.
 But there was no mercy to be had, no humanity in his work.
 If he could not outsmart him, outplay him in a game of his own devising,
 then he would be gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps later rather than sooner, but he would be done for.
 All that mattered was that the uprising would succeed, that it would indeed
 take them by surprise.
 And if he perished during that, it mattered not.
 His memory would live on, his legacy and story told as part of the Liberation
 of the Territories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They would be free, again.
 Free to live their own lives as they saw fit.
 Damn the Patriarch and the Castigator and all their cronies, henchmen and
 little thugs, and devils, the men that willingly gave up their souls in
 exchange for a whip, or a quill or a sword.
 Damn them all, they would be free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having lost himself in thought, he hadn't been aware they had descended
 so very deep.
 Instead of stone masonry and man-made walls, they were now walking amidst
 tunnels, wide enough for two men to walk in, dug in the rock and granite
 of the Disciplinarium hill.
 These were old, older than the Disciplinarium, carved in a time lost from
 memory, that no annal had recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he was privy to most of the workings of the Disciplinarium, he had
 not known the dungeons extended to such a depth.
 He was surprised.
 He felt wary of what other surprises lay in stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon they reached a grated gate, sentry guards posted in both sides of the
 gate.
 Where the far side lay, there was little or no light from torches or any
 other kind of lighting.
 No candles either.
 Simply darkness, eerie and silent, like ink blotting the senses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the procrastinators nodded to the sentries to leave their posts.
 They would be taking over.
 The sentries looked at each other and knowingly and without protest, question
 or remark, opened the gate, handed their heavy cast iron keys to the procrastin
ators and quietly and without further ado left in an organized fashion,
 forming a single file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them looked back and cast a passing gaze at Ursempyre, an expression
 of surprised recognition formed in his face and then it was gone, replaced
 by a fearful, stung furrow.
 Even the guards around this place realized the importance of what would
 follow.
 The Noble Representative would be tortured, questioned, and killed by the
 Patriarch himself.
 An ill omen, but who would challenge the will of the Law and the Patriarch,
 Reverent and Beloved of the Gods, the Holy Avatar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the men that had led him into the caves, spoke with a restrained
 voice, somewhat confused about whether he should refer to Ursempyre as
 a Lord or as just another lost soul, knowing he was at the non-existing
 mercy of the Patriarch.
 He chose the later, fearful of the walls having ears:

-Hilderich is the random apprentice.
 He is the unknwoing target of the Patriarch because he carries tha Master
 Keystone with which entry can be gained into the SToneforger which is the
 game's center, where the current status of the game can be learned.
 The Pilgrim is the decedant of the enemy player of the Patriarch, and his
 people are the last remnants of the enemy that he has to eradicate.
 Each Pilgrimage is a desperate way to keep the game going for the losing
 side.
 Each Pilgrim has to get to the Widelands which was a huge battleground
 where the game was initially lost for the Pilgrim's playing side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
-Amonas has been brainwashed by the Patriarch.
 When Amonas first stumbled upon the teleporter, he was in fact teleported
 to the inner shell, just as when he teleported with Hilderich.
 When he was brainwashed he was led to believe he saw the truth behind the
 Council, the Castigator and the Patriarch and he was implanted with the
 mission of seeking out Hilderich and bringing to the teleporter in order
 to get to the bullhorns.
 The bullhorns and the mass driver train are the only way into the Necropolis.
 In essence, the PAtriarch needs Hilderich's Master Keystone in order to
 open the Necropolis.
 He has to get someone into the NEcropolis and his best bet is his Pawn
 , Amonas, and Hilderich.
 Once they open the Necropolis, he will be able to march into the Widelands
 under the cover of the army, capture them again and take their knowledge,
 find out why he has not won the game yet, and learn of the existence and
 wherabouts of the last pawns of his enemy, the people of the Pilgrim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
-The Patriarch has been creating more and more oppresive ways to create
 a rebellion in order to draw out what he believes must be the last remnants
 of his enemy.
 He has done so before, each rebellion failing, and the game still hasn't
 ended.
 He is fed up and wants to cheat indirectly.
 That is why he uses Amonas, who was a member of the resitence who stumbled
 upon the teleporter in the first place.
 The Patriarch as the player's avatar has knowledge of the teleporters and
 the mass driver train and such, but he cannot actively use them as that
 would be in violation of the rules and he would be disqualified.
 The mass driver train is in fact a network of such trains that serves as
 the mechanism behind the support of the two shells, it is what makes the
 structure of the shellworld viable.
 The key is to gain indirect access to the game's center, the Stoneforger,
 which is located in the Necropolis.

Ursempyre's steps were measured and slow, but steady and unwavering.

The cave seemed to be hollowed out artificially, swaths of incandescent
 light pouring out from the large orifice he was instructed the Patriarch
 was awaiting his presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he entered the chamber, the intense light made him squint reflexively,
 but his eyes adjusted.
 It seemed as if light was pouring out of some strange, tall, glass columns
 that seemed to extend beyond the floot and the ceiling of the chamber,
 as if actually grown out of the rock itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre's interest was at once piqued by what he was seeing all around
 him: Four large glass columns like huge rods brimming with light, seemingly
 supporting the tall, wide rocky chamber.
 The Patriarch was standing with his back turned to Ursempyre right amid
 the four columns, his bald scalp glistening under the blueish-white light
 of the columns, gossamer shadows of himself cast in the shape of a cross
 across the rough, uneven, rocky floor.
 Small wet brown lime stone indentations and juts with tiny spots of shadow
 dotted the ground.
 A faint humming noise echoed faintly throughout the chamber, which was
 otherwise dead silent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre was drawn into the scenery, taken by surprise, but not overwhelmed.
 He felt curious.
 So much more as to what the intentions of the Patriarch were.
 He had been expecting a torture chamber with a multitude of tools and instrumen
ts.
 Instead, he was being shown something very few people, if ever, became
 privy to.
 Perhaps the folk tales about the Ancients and the Curator's ramblings were
 not all for naught.
 But then again, what reason did the Patriarch have to reveal such a place
 to him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thoughts were interrupted by the sly, surreptitious voice of the Patriarch,
 which broke the silence of the chamber, sounding as if it resonating with
 the columns and the rock walls, each adding to its effect:

Ursempyre frowned quizzically at the Patriarch's words.
 He could neither understand exactly what he was telling him, or more importantl
y why.
 As always, scripture in High Helican decorated its hem discreetly.
 He didn't look resplendent or intimidating.
 The Patriarch turned to face Ursempyre, hands neatly hidden inside the
 folds of his robes, simple and utilitarian yet finely crafted from quality
 cloth.
 It was as if he sounded sincere for the first time when he spoke again:
\end_layout

 holding it together barely at the seams.
 The Patriarch sounded amused when he replied:

Ursempyre's voice had deep, grave undertones etched in it.
 He meant to come across as serious and truthful, yet non-plussed-plussed,
 not just a lackey or one of their goons to be simply expected to obey unquestio

 He wanted the Patriarch to know that he wasn't terrified by the Patriarch.

It was supremely decorated with fine leather and silky surfaces, girdles

 In concert, an even more ornate and large chair with a large backside,

It seemed preposterous, but it looked like as if even more extravagant events

With that last phrase, a plain wooden jug of wine appeared on the Patriarch's

 The Patriarch added while waving one hand dismissively:

Ursempyre was still dumbfounded, not as much because of the Patriarch ability
 to instantly and at will conjure items of his liking, but more so because
 of what he was saying, or trying to imply.
 The Patriarch was not, in any way, a simple man.
 He was being flippant, mocking him in the process.

Ursempyre thought he had been exposed, and all the niceties had now evaporated.
 He steeled himself mentally, closing his eyes and thinking of happier,
 earlier times.
 His muscles relaxed.
 He was waiting for a hammering blow.
 Nothing happened any time soon.
 The Patriarch drew the his chair, and sagged on it, as if exhausted from
 copious effort.
 He flexed his hands and crossed his palms, knuckles pointing upward, almost
 as if in prayer.
 At length, he sighed, and then spoke in a raspy, tired voice, more suited
 to a broken old man rather than the Patriarch, the Holy Avatar of the Gods.

I'm tired of being reminded of my failings, tired of games I guess.
 But I'm not willing to lose, not after all the time I've spent.
 Do you understand that, Lord Ursempyre Remis, Noble Representative? Can
 you, really? Even if I showed you, could you fathom? Or would your lesser,
 weak mind break down from hopelessness? Could you indeed ride on the wave
 of apocalypse that would follow, Ursempyre? I have to pity, hate, and envy

 You and your people.
 But this has to end as well.

Ursempyre was progressively more and more mystified at what the Patriarch
 was saying.
 Again, he noticed, it wasn't the trick show and the flashiness, the strangeness
 of what was happening.
 It was the Patriarch himself that was doing it, twisting reality, violating
 normalcy.

He was acting out of character, for one thing.
 It was as if he was trying to make some point, but had not done so ever
 before in his life and was unable to make himself understood in human terms.
 He was somehow circumnavigating the point in question, never directly touching
 it, uttering generalities and giving cryptically hints, as if his annotations
 alone sufficed.

Ursempyre hated that quality in a man, evasiveness, mucking about rather

Hilderich words came out sharp and proud.
 He managed to even surprise himself with his clarity and aboveboard voice

He wasn't thinking clearly now, he knew, but he imagined he'd go for his

The Patriarch reached out for a small goblet of wine, its contents sloshing
 as if it had just been poured.
 In fact, it had just appeared on his desk.
 He sipped some wine, all the while Lord Remis quieted down, his laughter
 made still by the Patriarch's lack of an answer, physical or verbal.
 At length, after seeming to savor the wine properly, like a man who found
 meaning in the tasteful little joys of life, like a good wine, he said
 with more authority, gravity weighing his words, the rocky chamber echoing
 them, magnifying the effect:

The Patriarch had risen from his seat, hands behind his back, and was very
 slowly pacing around the columns, his form every once in a while disappearing
 behind a blaze of blue and white light, each time a sliver of his figure

 if it had the ability to see behind the facade of the Patriarch.
 Ursempyre felt suddenly naked, as he had been bared against his will, but
 he had not protested.

The Patriarch paused and put a hand to his chin, stroking his beard lightly,
 a finger to his lips, as if he was searching for his next words, engrossed
 in thought, careful of what exactly to say.
 Ursempyre was transfixed, at a loss for words.
 He thought he shouldn't be doing this, he shouldn't be even listening to
 this devil.
 His heart told him to try and rip this human terror apart, for everyone's
 sake.
 His mind told him to stay his wrath, and listen.
 He was being told things he would never know otherwise.
 Thing he might use if he came out of this alive.
 The Patriarch resumed what was beginning to look like a monologue, or rather,
 an explaining of sorts:

You'll have to excuse my earlier outburst.
 These are trying times, even for me.

 I might be lying, indeed, but what difference would it make to you?

He had made a full round of the columns, and he was now standing in front

 All this time Ursempyre had not moved from the place where he had been
 left standing.
 The Patriarch motioned with a nod that he should be seated, but Ursempyre
 declined in kind with an almost imperceptible shake of his head, his gaze
 fixed at the Patriarch at all times.

 The Patriarch went on:

This is a unique offer.
 For reasons you will come to understand in due time, I'm offering you rule

Ursempyre tried to take in the Patriarch's words, but he felt unable to.
 It was an overwhelming thought.
 There were so many questions and possibilities going through his mind.
 Would he actually consider such a proposal? Did have any merit? Would the
 Patriarch keep true to his word? Was the Castigator really that powerless
 against the Patriarch? Then, what chance would he stand against Patriarch
 once he felt like he had served his purpose? If he was so powerful, why
 did he need him? Why not crush the rebellion altogether? Why did he need
 him? What were his limitations? An bloodless uprising, but to what a future
 would it lead? This rotten system would not go away.
 The Patriarch, and the Council, and all the tyranny would still be around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No.
 He felt dirty, almost soiled that he had even began to consider such an

 He had decided.
 He would not become a willing pawn.

\begin_layout Standard
That last temptation, the easy way out, a bloodless shadow of a victory,

He had studied as much of history as possible, he had seen behind the veil

 He weighed and balanced everything and he believed he could prove, by way

 A situation where nothing new and worthwhile would ever arise, a steady
 circle of people giving birth, and dying, too busy and occupied with the
 endless toils of life and too frightened of losing what little breath they
 had been spared.

I think you've misunderstood my intentions.
 This is not a political bargain.
 Indeed any bargain of sorts.
 It is merely a possibility I am willing to entertain, because it suits
 me.
 Perhaps I haven't been too clear, and at the same time I have misjudged
 your intelligence and powers of reasoning and extrapolation.
 I am not sharing power, or recognizing my decisions and rule as mistaken.
 You will not be handed real authority, and yes the people will continue
 to be oppressed as you put it, until I deem otherwise.
 You have no real lever against me, apart from certain time constraints
 that I must keep in mind.
 In other words, I am offering you a much more civilized way out, because
 I haven't got the time to grind your puny rebellious followers into oblivion.
 Is that much understood now? Am I coming across? Can you reestablish the
 true position you are in now? Can you fathom that in my greater scheme
 of things you and your 'people' are a nuisance I want to deal with efficiently
 and move on? Or are you that infatuated with your pet idea of a free world
 that you have been completely cut off from reality? Perhaps you might think
 that can all act in every way you feel like, that chaos can somehow lead
 to wonder.
 That it all sorts itself out in the end, doesn't it? How preposterous a
 notion! I can only find it natural to nurture such gross misconceptions
 since you are little more than infants, barely able to stand on their own
 two feet.
 How could you possible know the truth of the cosmos? You still think of
 the stars as prickles of light, some of them falling down as they die.
 You would know real fear and awe when you saw the death of a star, I can
 assure you of that.
 But you still would not believe me.

Ursempyre involuntarily flinched at the uncanny remark and was terrified

 I might also be giving away details and information you would never even

 my new Castigator, and if you die, well, dead men can't talk.
 Not that the rumors have hurt me much over the years.

 Suspension of disbelief can be a powerful weapon.

Ursempyre's face was stern, contorted from the anxiety.
 He realized perspiration was running down his temples for some time.
 He had to make a leap of faith, and trust in himself like never before.
 Still, he knew he was walking in a territory far more dangerous than he
 could have imagined from beforehand.
 The Castigator, another pawn.
 These weird abilities of the Patriarch.
 Like the stories of Old, before the Pantheon.
 Folk tales they had seemed, but now they were inescapably real, made manifest
 before his eyes.
 He did not know their true nature, and was loathe to find out.
 Still, why was he being offered this now? Should he not refuse? What made
 the Patriarch so certain of his superiority? What was the true extent of
 his power? Why had he not crushed them at their inception, while they were
 still a handful, weak, their organization still a dream, a footnote of
 history and legend brought back from oblivion, nothing but a speck against
 the power the Council held all over all? He had to find out before he plunged

Why should I accept your offer? What makes you certain, what can you do

 trade, economy? Isn't almost everything under your control, in one form
 or another? Except perhaps the air we breath.
 Even the earth and the water, so indispensable to life itself, has become
 a commodity, something to be sold and acquired, according to your sick
 whims and desires.
 Even though that has held true for generations, we are willing to give
 our lives to stop this.
 And believe me we will, unquestioningly, unflinchingly.
 How will you break that resolve, I ask you? Since you are the one that
 has caused this, its your Law and your rule that has brought things too
 far.
 What good will the vanishing tricks do? Will you just vanish when the crowds
 of free men will be running after you? Demanding nothing less than your
 head? Or will you put on another light show like the one around me, hoping
 that the people you consider animals will be dazed, so sublimed that they'll
 beg you for forgiveness for their sins? Tell me, oh Holy Avatar, why should

 I must admit I sometimes feel a certain measure of pride at what I have
 achieved here.
 As for your other question, I believe that you should be careful not to
 confuse what you have seen here with the true extend of my powers.
 This is not a show I put on for you specifically, Lord Remis.
 It is merely an extension of courtesy, in good faith.
 I simply meant to cast off my mask, to create an honest, conversational
 atmosphere, in which I could nurture a more direct relationship with you,
 vis-a-vis.
 I simply showed you that I am not the man you might have thought I was,

 wrath.
 An angel of the Gods who would come down from above and wipe us all in

The Patriarch took a step back, and extended his arms.
 He took on a solemn expression, as if praying or concentrating deeply.
 A strange smell assaulted Ursempyre's nostrils.
 It seemed to emanate from the Patriarch, as far as Ursempyre could tell.
 A smell that reminded him of metal against metal, the smell of blacksmith's
 shop but he all he could see was that the Patriarch was now a bit taller
 than before.
 No, he thought, he is not taller.
 Something's wrong here, his mind voiced with concern.
 He noticed the Patriarch's feet were no longer touching the ground.
 Then, faint bluish crackles of light like tiny lightning's and sparks of
 light coursed through the Patriarch, his bald scalp having taken on an
 eerie sheen, as if it was suddenly a shiny metal mirror.
 The Patriarch grinned and uttered in High Helican:

With that, the Patriarch tensed and a bright shiny aura began to emanate
 from him, as if turned on suddenly.
 Then his robes were drawn in, tightened around his body as if instantly
 shrunk.
 They visibly outlined his figure, and Ursempyre was surprised once more
 to see that such a body did not belong to an old man.
 It was an immaculate body, perfectly carved as if it was a statue, a penultimat
e monument to the human body, its musculature detailed beyond any artisan's
 capabilities and talent.
 It was the body a demi-God, exuding awe by sight alone.
 The Patriarch's face began to twist and reshape itself as if it was made
 of water or mercury, all the facial characteristics turning into a pool
 engulfed in bright light as fire was about to scorch it.
 And all the while he could see the grin of the Patriarch, even though his
 face was no longer there.
 His mind reeled from the sight before him.
 It was true then, this was a monster beyond comparison.
 the stories and legends were true.
 And the Day of Redemption had happened.
 And it was him.
 It was him all along.
 Even before, all those years past.
 It had always been him.
 The realization left him wide-eyed struggling for breath.
 The robes around the Patriarch were absorbed into his flesh, which was
 now a rippling pool of molten metal, incandescent with a fiery aura around
 it, levitating a few feet above the ground, resplendent and regal in its
 unique and terrible form.
 At length, this figure spoke at him, with no visible source for the voice:

 He only managed to nod, still staring at the majestic being in front of
 him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre felt shocked, minuscule, unimportant.
 They were against a being of unimaginable power, not based solely on its
 manipulations, schemes, and outright terror practices.
 This was something else entirely, an terrible force.
 A demon that left you mesmerized in awe.
 Why couldn't this be a mere show, he thought.
 How could he have lived so long ago? How could he have brought such destruction
 by himself alone? How did he know he wasn't just lying, as was his usual
 practice?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knew.
 When he saw him change into that thing, he saw.
 He felt its corruption overwhelm him, its malevolence flow around him,
 its power beaming right through him.
 It was true.
 He didn't know how exactly, but it was true.
 He could wipe them out if he needed too, if he wanted to.
 he did not believe that thing could be hurt, not in any real sense.
 He did not know whether the Patriarch himself was still vulnerable, but
 he now believed this was his true form, and the old man a mere charade
 he found more practical.
 Or perhaps it was another one of his whims.
 It didn't matter, this was inescapable.
 He had no options now.
 All he had been planning was for naught.
 He would play along.
 But he would not give up.
 No, he knew they were at a disadvantage, but that was now a blessing.
 Had they went on with their plan, they would have been culled like sheep.
 It was almost as if he was trying to give them a warning, a second chance.
 He would capitulate he would accept, but only for now.
 Only until he knew what was going on this world of his, what was the truth
 behind all this, who was this being that had ruled over them for untold
 years with iron and steel, and whip and truncheon? He'd do what he could,
 and perhaps find a way to bring him down.
 The others, though, who had not seen what he had seen, would they believe
 him? Or would they just curse him as the traitor he would seem to have
 become? He could do little about that.
 he only hoped they'd forgive him before his end.
 That somehow this would workout.
 He turned to face the fiery figure, and looking at were its eyes should
 have been, managed to utter levelly:

I will.
 I only do this because I now believe you when you say lives will be lost

 Always remember that I only do this as a lesser evil, nothing more.
 I will only serve my people, not you, ever.
 If I find a way to turn against you, I will do so, without hesitation.

Yes, indeed.
 I'm sure you will.
 Now that we finally settled this matter, I'll issue the relevant orders
 and perform the Ceremony of Kyryksis.
 Naturally, once you ascend to office you will also issue a statement for
 your men to stand down, and reconcile their grievances, as reforms are
 sure to be made and an arrangement has been agreed upon for a gradual transitio
n into a free society.
 I believe the majority will accept such a turn of events with relief.
 No one likes dying.
 Except for a few fools that will probably follow your plan to the end anyway.
 Nothing important that my people will not be able to handle.
 Congratulations on a well-informed decision, Lord Remis.

The Patriarch returned to his human form in mere moments, the transition
 this time a lot quicker and much less dramatic.
 He offered his hand grinning profusely, but Ursempyre did not accept it.
 He rather looked at the Patriarch's hand with boiling contempt and disgust.
 The Patriarch insisted, the hand still extended for a handshake, and said:

Ursempyre's face was tense, as if carved of stone.
 His equally hard glare at the Patriarch, his eyes like fiery pinpricks
 of unyielding light, indicated that he was expending huge amounts of patience
 and self-restrain in order for him not to lunge at the Patriarch right
 then and there.
 But he would bide his time.
 With obvious reluctance and slow, deliberate motions that brought to mind
 a man in pain, he managed to shake hands with the Patriarch.
 He felt like he now carried a stain he could never wash off.
 He paused in thought, and at length asked the Patriarch who was about to
 call out to the guards:

 tall, bleak man in a uniform approached a couple of soldiers that were
 standing over a fire, with a kettle on top of it brewing something with
 an uncharacteristic, though quite off-putting smell.
 They were sitting on some sacks laden with what must have been rice or
 wheat, having a smoke, sharing a pipe of what one knowledgeable in the
 art of uwe smoking could make out to be stale uwe.
 That is only when every once in a while the wind blew off the stench coming
 from the kettle.
 They were unaware of the tall man coming their way, since their backs were
 turned to him, and they were admiring the ships loading and unloading their
 cargoes in the distance of the harbor, the suns setting in quick succession,
 painting the sea mauve and bloody red, the sails casting their last shadows
 for the day.
 Their calm reverie was broken by a harsh, raspy voice:
\end_layout

What's in that kettle? Smells worse than the cow dung you're smoking.
 I can only imagine you're smoking it to cover that gods-awful stench you're

 Last time you bathed, it must've been when the midwife rinsed off your
 mother's blood.

One of the two soldiers turned around and with a passing look of small surprise
 offered the pipe to the tall man, in spite of him sounding provocatively
 belittling.
 The other man remained indifferent, his head seemed to follow a flock of
 seabirds in the distance, swooping over the sea, probably hunting fish,
 or perhaps idling away their time, just as they were.
 The tall man was now standing with one foot on a stack of sacks.
 He took the proffered pipe and took a quaff of smoke, savored it before
 exhaling slowly, and then spoke to the two soldiers:

Dekar Pirru shook his head, grinning at the same time.
 Mott was now stirring his broth with a thick wooden stick that just seemed
 to be lying around handily.
 Lanris was putting some fresh uwe in his pipe.
 Twilight was upon them, the smoke from their kettle barely visible now.
 Dekar Pirru seemed suddenly engrossed with thought, his gaze stuck on the
 boiling kettle, eyes seemingly out of focus.
 Lanris took notice, waved his hand to check if indeed the dekar was in
 touch with his surroundings, and found out that was not the case.
 He said with a taste of lack of conviction:

The dekar was standing upright again, arms folded, his sword sheath dangling
 about his belt, his expression a bit sour.
 Lanris on the other hand seemed quite relaxed, resting on the sacks nonchalantl
y, seemingly more concerned about the serving time of Mott's stew.
 He took a drought of smoke from his pipe, before answering his dekar without
 turning to look at him: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Not my place to tell, dekar.
 I just sharpen my sword, fill my pipe and gulp down what Mott fancies each

 Though his menu is kind of repetitive.
 It must be the fourth time in a row we're having stew.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, said Lanris with a mixed feeling of resignation and indifference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mott interjected Lanris abruptly, as if he was chiding him:

\begin_layout Standard
Lanris intoned his last word with a certain character and an outlandish
 accent that made everyone laugh, especially Mott whose sullen mood was
 eased, and was now up on his feet, stirring his stew with a certain air
 of culinary dexterity.
 Around them, more campfires could be seen, soldiers like them who were
 about to cook something of their own, usually broths of wheat or barley
 which were the main staple food the army provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were about to relax from the exercises of the day, as well as their
 other various duties.
 Some would eat something quick before heading off for sentry and patrol
 duty, and some would rest their aching muscles, have a pipe and something
 to fill their bellies, and sleep heavily until the next morning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some would have made their own arrangements concerning food, perhaps going
 out of their way to procure some meat, either by hunting, or by making
 certain trades, sometimes of a dubious nature.
 Most of the soldiers that did so, traded wine for meat or eggs.
 Wine and spirits were strongly forbidden, but vinegar was allowed to be
 carried, as it was a proven way of cleaning up wounds as well as used in
 the soldier's personal hygiene.
 At least for those that cared about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some had a knack of mixing some vinegar with wine right before consuming
 it, in case some of the officers or procrastinators were making their rounds,
 checking up on morale or discipline in the latter case.
 Some had dubbed it winegar, and the name was in wide use in the army.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even the officers partook sometimes, as it was known to them that the morale
 and cohesion of an army was far more important in battle than mere discipline
 and adherence to Law.
 It might be a sin, they knew, but who went through life as immaculate and
 free of sin as they when he was born?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as long as those buffoons, the procrastinators, were none the wiser,
 everything worked almost as it should, and the army served its Castigator,
 and the Pantheon, in a most untroubled fashion.
 After all, as some of the older officers used to say, you can't make soldiers
 if you don't break open a few casks first.

Mott announced with some enthusiasm in his voice:

Mott simply shrugged and went to his backpack to fetch his canteen.
 Lanris did so with languid motions, probably certain that the broth in
 Mott's kettle would not disappear any time soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They each helped themselves to a serving, and sat down on the ground, their
 backs against the sacks.
 They split some leftover bread-pie from their midday meal, and each began
 eating from their canteens, Mott clearly more than pleased with the quality
 of his cooking, gulping spoonfuls away with vivid enjoyment.
 Lanris seemed much more reserved in his appreciation, and seemed to just
 be thankful for having something other than the drab, gray gunk the army
 called food to fill his stomach with.

Lanris paused momentarily and furrowed his brow before continuing to eat
 slowly, more so because he wasn't too fond of Mott's stew rather than because
 he was savoring it.
 Mott on the other hand was scraping the last spoonfuls in his canteen,
 and was quite possibly going to refill it soon.
 Dekar Pirru went on:

 Pirru grinned at Mott's comment and said with a slight edge of worry in
 his voice:

Lanris left his canteen unfinished, broth and bread-pie still mixed inside.
 He placed it near one side of Mott, who surely not let it go to waste once
 his second canteen was emptied.
 Lanris wiped his mouth on his sleeve, and started filling his pipe from
 a pouch he had not opened before.
 He asked Pirru then:

Dekar, how come you got by all these news? It's not like you to run around

They both laughed somewhat bitterly in spite themselves.
 Pirru checked hastily around, not really bothering to indeed look for procrasti

 reaction to fear of getting caught.
 He reached into his uniform and produced a small leather flask, no bigger
 than their water flask.
 He unsealed it and gave it to Lanris.

Dekar Pirru and Private Lanris of the 5th, under the command of Cilliarch
 Romentho Isoract were put to the sword today at dawn, right after roll
 call, by a squad of procrastinators.
 Expeditious procedures were followed and their files of death were officially
 sealed by both the Procrastinator's Office and the Strategium Proper.
 Private Mott of the 5th, was given fifty lashes and almost bled to death
 for, and I quote: 'Not being vigilant enough in the prosecution of vile
 deeds that promoted sin, incurred the wrath of the Gods or were an affront
 to the Pantheon and the Ruling Council'.
 He was not allowed to return to his duties as an active soldier and as
 such was denied of medical attention.
 He was rotated to the work gangs as per the Cilliarch's orders.
 Also, Cilliarch Isoract relieved centarch Littmo from his duties and has
 petitioned that he be discharged dishonorably.
 The winegar in question seems to have been stolen from the centarch's personal
 cabinet, from what the procrastinator investigation revealed.

General Tyrpledge saluted briefly, almost touching his breastplate with
 his relaxed fist, and sighed.
 Major Guighan, clicked his heels, resumed a more relaxed, but still attentive
 posture and asked the general:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge seemed to ponder that suggestion for a little while, briefly consideri
ng what he could have the Major do.
 He was rather disenchanted by everything today.
 He was looking at the ceiling, the expression on his face lacking the usual
 austere, professional look.
 He took a look in his mirror earlier.
 He supposed he looked kind of glum, morose, even outright sad.
 There wasn't much he could about it, he thought.
 Neither was there something for the major to do as well.
 He waved him away with one hand, while he kept tapping a marching tune
 on his desk with his fingers on the other hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major was about to laugh when he saw the general was not smiling when
 he said what the major thought of as a joke.
 He then clicked his heels, made a couple of paces backwards still facing
 the general, turned about smartly and left, careful to close the door behind
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge sighed more audibly this time, thinking this day had started off
 more badly than usual.
 Though the term 'usual' was rapidly evolving from day to day, this was
 as bad as bad days can become.
 And it was still only morning.
 Major Guighan had just given him the latest situational report.
 These two men were the first dead in this campaign, and a single shot had
 yet to be fired.
 They'd been executed for drinking winegar and stealing from an officer.
 The centarch's career was gone.
 Perhaps at an opportune time, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last night a message had arrived, complete with high-ranking ministers and
 a squad of the procrastinator elite.
 Tyrpledge had been notified that the army was now officially mobilized
 and legally at war.
 Of course, he thought, there were no specific orders included, other than
 that he should await for further notification at a later time.
 In essence, they were leaving him and his men to roast on hot coals until
 it suited their purpose.
 Such was the fate of soldiers, he mused bitterly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, those orders had cost those men from the 5th their lives.
 As it is, they were at war even though they didn't know with who, and that
 meant that by Law, the procrastinators dispersed among them had more authority
 than he did in matters of discipline, persecution of sinners and the relevant
 penalties that might apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed that in wartime, theft and consumption of spirits and other substances
 that 'occluded the mind' were punishable by death.
 Tyrpledge was thinking that the centarch whose life was destroyed was lucky
 compared to his men.
 He then spared a few moments thinking about the soldier who was found asleep,
 next to the ones that had been drinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had given him fifty lashes because he wasn't vigilant enough.
 And then they had left him without even a towel to soak up his blood.
 Tyrpledge's thoughts on the matter was that it would be a miracle if he
 made it out alive.
 But that's what war is about.

, he voiced his final thoughts in a low voice, almost a whisper, and sat
 upright in his chair, hands outstretched, his gaze focused outside beyond
 his window, where he could see the majority of his battalions forming up.
 He could discern a sullen mood.
 It was not that the pace of the men milling about was slow.
 They were preparing their equipment fastidiously, checking their armor
 and their packs so as to make sure everything was in order.
 They had that unmistakable air of professionalism about them.
 But they seemed to be lacking the blaze in their eyes.
 The glimmer in their eyes, the red flush cheeks that let you know their
 blood was boiling, their hearts pumping with excitement.
 There were no such signs here.
 No nervous humor from his staff members, no raunchy jokes from the enlisted
 men.
 At least he could see any of them laughing.
 Every face he could make out from that distance, was stern, frigid, cold.
 This, he thought, should not be the faces of men going to war, knowing
 they might be dead before the night falls, wishing their death would be
 worthwhile, remembered, even praised.
 This was the face of men knowing they might be dead and wishing they were
 someplace else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The execution of the men from the 5th had taken quite a toll on overall
 morale.
 They might be much more cowed now, but that's not what he needed to wage
 war.
 He needed hot-bloodied men with vices and things to wish for.
 Not little meek children fearful of the reprisals of the Law.
 Why didn't the procrastinators understand that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the briefest moment he thought about contacting the Procrastinator Militant,
 asking for his assistance, perhaps telling him even to go as far as relaxing
 their vigilance, bending but not strictly breaking the Law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He immediately thought better of it, since he reminded himself that Gomermont
 was above all, first and foremost an idiot.
 And telling an idiot who has spent a considerable amount of time and effort
 to become leader of a pack of idiots to smarten up a bit suddenly, was
 if not a one-way ticket to the gallows, a certain way to scream in despair
 and agony at the mind-numbing foolishness the Procrastinator Militant exuded
 with his every utterance.
 In essence, it would be a lost cause.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a time for war and a time for peace, security, stability, lawfulness.
 War was lawlessness in itself, a grandiose lawless fair where people died
 horribly and for reasons beyond their understanding, where nothing mattered
 more than victory.
 When would they understand that? Probably not soon enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His bleak thoughts were accented by the lack of a good cup of uwe.
 He decided he wanted a nice distraction, something to take his mind of
 a situation he now felt powerless to amend.
 He would just have to swim through the wave of the coming difficulties
 as they arose stoically.
 To do that, he had to have a good cup of uwe, fresh and steamy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He now felt determined to turn his thoughts around, wish for the best, keep
 his hopes up.
 The uwe would be critical in that respect.
 He went for his bell in order to let his aide-de-camps know he wanted some
 uwe urgently, but before he could do that, as if by a miracle or a mind-reading
 ability that the major had not exhibited so far, he entered through the
 door in a hurried fashion, stood to one side, saluted briskly and clicked
 the heels of his boots, his sword smartly tucked away with his free hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before Tyrpledge could utter a single word, the Castigator of the Outer
 Territories walked in the general's office, resplendent in his war gear,
 a match for what he was wearing on the anniversary of the Pacification
 of Zaelin, the brightly polished metal casting off intense reflections
 of the suns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major tried announced the Castigator, but he was cut short by a wave
 of the Castigator's hand, barely having time to utter the word 'behold'.
 The Castigator was dressed for wartime, that much was certain.
 His lavishly plumed helmet under his one arm, he asked the general directly,
 who was still sitting down in his chair, too flabbergasted to remember
 about adhering to protocol and paying proper respect:

Celia gave her hand like Ikebod asked her, and he led her through a small
 corridor into the waiting room, which was in essence, a large guest hall,
 lavishly adorned with paintings, complete with what appeared to be well-lacquer
ed hand made quality furniture of very fine and delicate taste.
 There were even crystal chandeliers full of lit candles, brightly illuminating
 every corner of the more than adequately large chamber, fit for a grand
 banquet rather than a mere waiting room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paintings seemed to be portraits of the ancestral Lord of House Remis,
 numerous indeed.
 Celia had no intimate knowledge of the House's history and tradition, but
 it seemed like they were truly an old, venerable family of illustrious
 heritage.
 She took a closer look of some of the portraits, and the plaques on each
 one confirmed her thoughts: Some had been Generals of the Army, some Noble
 Representatives just like Lord Ursempyre.
 But she took more notice of the ones who seemed not to have taken a liking
 in politics or the army.
 Their portraits were mostly family portraits, including all the close members
 of the family: their children and wife, as well as their grandchildren
 where applicable.
 Some portraits were quite large, others much smaller, rather undistinguished.
 Most depicted smiling, warm, inviting faces.
 House Remis seemed to be bred and raised as good-hearted, wholesome people.
 It seemed only natural to her now that one of them would choose to side
 himself with what many would consider dangerous, traitorous, spiteful,
 blasphemous people.
 The thought that any man would consider people like Amonas as such, depicting
 them as worse then murderous scum, made her giggle despite herself.
 Her thoughts went briefly to Amonas.
 She stopped giggling then, but did not feel despair and sullenness like
 before.
 She simply felt a keen longing for her love.
 That made her touch her swollen belly reflexively, as if to share her thoughts
 with her unborn child.

She sat down on a wide couch with red velvet lining and only one arm.
 It must have been purposefully designed as such, for people to relax comfortabl
y in a lying position.
 With slow, careful movements she laid herself down, her head relaxing on
 a plush soft pillow propped against the couch's single arm.
 She felt her back throbbing slightly, faint echoes of pain coursing from
 her feet up to her neck.
 She was tired, she had to admit to herself.
 The tension and the urgency, the walk here, all that had been too much
 for her in her situation.
 She thought for a minute how she could hope to outrun any possible pursuers.
 She hoped she'd give birth before such a necessity arose, and if that was
 not the case, she hoped she'd find the strength to do so.
 Her gaze wondered around the luxurious but not pompous chamber.
 Small objects of art were to be found on most furniture, like the grand
 table and some fine cabinets.
 She thought the decoration was very appropriate and measured, to her surprise.
 She had thought rooms like these were designed to impress with their ornate
 luxury, flaunt the owner's riches and resources.
 But this was not the case.
 It was an elegant space, that very much invited pleasant, quiet, reflection
 and sincere conversation.
 A place to spend quality time, she thought.
 As she closed her eyes, eagerly welcoming the onset of a much wanted sleep,
 her gaze was locked on plain but beautifully crafted vase of pure crystal,
 the shimmer of the candle light forming tiny little multi-hued rainbows
 on the crystal's numerous faces.
 It reminded her of summers gone past, she and her father alone by the like,
 him teaching her about the water, the sky and the light.
 She could only remember him fishing quietly, almost reverently, with never-endi
ng patience and almost complete devotion.
 With that warm memory, she fell asleep on the couch, clutching her abdomen
 because of an instinct none could hope to suppress.

She woke up drenched in sweat and threw the covers laid on her in frenzied
 panic.
 Her breathing was fast and heavy.
 She had seen a nightmare.
 This time she had been captured by men with no face.
 The memory of it was still vivid.
 The men had tried to kill her baby, without killing her outright..
 She had made every effort not to let them, but in vain.
 They had their way and left there where she lay, a damp place that smelled
 of metal and rust.
 They'd left her there to die, right by her baby.
 She shivered at the thought and felt dry tears staining her cheeks.
 She must have screamed when she woke up, because Ikebod was running down
 the stairs, a glass of water in one hand.

You seem a little pale.
 That will not do in your situation.
 I have prepared dinner myself.
 I was waiting for Master Ursempyre to return but that has yet to happen.
 I admit I am more than worried for his safety.
 He was summoned by the Patriarch himself.
 His delay could mean a lot of things, most of which I dare not think about
 from consternation.
 In any case he would not want a guest of his to starve to death, especially
 a lady carrying.
 I would be happy to serve you dinner, even though it is now past midnight.

\begin_layout Standard
Ikebod's tone belied his fear.
 He sounded calm and accommodating, professional as ever.
 As if the danger his master was probably facing was no more than a hindrance,
 an annoyance at best, and that he would soon be surely meeting them at
 the dinner table.
 Celia on the other hand sat upright with a jolt, her eyes went wide and
 her face wore a mixed expression of anxiety, disbelief and exasperation.
 Her voice was pitched high when she said to Ikebod, staring him with a
 frown:
\end_layout

Went to meet with the Patriarch you say? Under the circumstances that does
 sound too fortuitous for comfort.
 Could it be that the uprising has been revealed? Your master could be in
 grave danger, Ikebod! Surely you must've heard the stories! The Patriarch
 makes people vanish as if they never had been born! And you ask of me to
 have dinner at such a time? How could I ever?

\begin_layout Standard
Ikebod took the courage of sitting right beside her, a gesture he would
 have normally found insulting beyond forgiveness, indeed beyond absolution.
 Nevertheless, he felt lady Celia would not be offended, and he wanted her
 to understand him wholly on the matter:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dear lady Celia, I know all that, and still I would ask of you to have something
 to eat.
 For your child's sake.
 Do not think of me as a cynic, or a bland acquiescent servant.
 I dearly love Master Ursempyre, for I have almost raised him as my own
 ever since his parents passed away when he was still just a little boy.
 When he left the estate, he gave me specific orders in the event of his
 disappearance.
 I too believe in the kinsfolk and the purpose that drives them.
 I would be betraying my master if I wavered, if I gave up without a fight,
 if I thought him dead and gone so easily.
 But even without him, lady Celia, life must go on.
 We must try our hardest to have freedom for all, for once.
 If anything should happen to him, I will grieve like a father who's lost
 his only child.
 But I've learned there's a time for grieving, and a time for hoping, a
 time for fighting.
 And so I shall hope, and fight, until I have reason to do nothing else
 but grieve.
 Do you understand that, my lady? I hope you do.
 Please now, come and have something to eat, if not for your sake, for your
 child's.

Celia looked in the old servant's eyes with compassion and a sudden care
 she had not felt until now.
 He was opening up his heart and soul to her, exhibiting trust she had thought
 rarely found.
 She thought she understood.
 In a manner, that was how she felt for Amonas, who though was nowhere to
 be found, and had not seen or heard from him for days now, she still knew
 he was alive.
 Against reason, she knew he was alive, somewhere.
 And she'd better give up her life before she gave up hope.
 Because, she thought, even if Amonas would never return, their child would
 be born.
 And she would have to do her best to deliver her child in a new, free world.
 Even if her love would not be there to greet their firstborn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She stifled some tears that welled up in her eyes and sniffed slightly.
 She nodded her understanding to Ikebod, and without further comment or
 remark she tried to smile uncomfortably and asked him:

Well, then.
 I've prepared some fawn soup with some beaten egg and lemon, a variety

 The salad is a mix of cabbage, lettuce, and radishes, dressed with oli
 and goat's cheese.
 For desert, I've prepared some cherry pie and the master's favorite, nutmeg
 and chestnut maffle.
 I apologize for the lack of salad variety, but I was in a hurry.

Celia nodded her thanks and smiled.
 She felt very lucky to be treated so warmly by, in essence, complete strangers.
 She was almost feeling guilty of overindulging herself, but she withheld
 such thoughts, since she felt they'd only serve to insult Ikebod's hospitality
 and hurt his feelings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went up the stairs and they were greeted by a large dining-hall, dark
 green and gray marble columns supporting the high ceiling.
 Exquisitely ornamented chandeliers adorned the roof and cast bright let
 across every corner.
 The dinner table was made from a fine solid piece of wood that seemed old
 and venerable, but judging by its healthy sheen, was thoroughly maintained.
 It was probably hundred of years old and from its size, Celia thought it
 could seat upwards of three dozen people, perhaps even four.
 She noticed there were no plates of food or dishes of any kind set and
 she was slightly puzzled.
 They were probably to be seated somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He led her to an antechamber through a utility corridor, meant for the servants
 to have access to the kitchen.
 Celia asked with evident interest:

Oh, most are asleep by now my lady.
 The maids tended to your room, and it's ready for you.
 I suggest you lie down there right after your dinner.
 Some of the other servants and the guards have certain duties to attend
 to in other parts of the estate, mainly the stables from what I can gather.
 House Remis is not always this silent, perhaps in the morning you will
 see for yourself.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia inquired no further and soon they entered the kitchen itself.
 Dimly lit by a few candles, it was full of utensils and large wooden surfaces
 for chopping meat and foodstuffs.
 She could see there were more than one stoves and at least large ovens.
 Large empty bowls, cauldrons and kettles were gathered in one corner.
 Though quite large for a kitchen, Celia felt the place was cramped and
 imagined it would be close to asphyxiating when people were working here
 in full swing.
 Ikebod pulled a chair for her and gestured for her to sit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She thanked him with a smile, and sat down to a quite normal table that
 seemed to have seen its fair share of use.
 It was indeed laid out with a simple linen, the bowl of soup in the middle,
 a glass and a wooden jug of wine side by side.
 Her plate was already filled with steaming soup, which gave off a light
 aroma.
 Indeed, the kitchen smelled of a lot of things, and the odors seemed to
 fight each other fervently but to no avail.
 She realized the smells exacerbated her hunger and she started to sip her
 soup eagerly.
 Ikebod asked Celia:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My feet ache.
 They tend to do that at my age.
 Would you mind if I silently kept you company?

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She felt indeed in the presence of a friend long lost, or more likely, long
 sought after.
 Perhaps Ikebod reminded her of her father.
 She was too young to remember much about him, but she knew he was a good
 father, a good man.
 She was certain Ikebod was such a man as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she finished her plate of soup, she briefly thought about having another
 serving.
 The child must be hungry as well, she thought.
 But another serving this late at night wouldn't help to ease her bad dreams.
 Ikebod, as if he could read minds, had already served her a plate of cherry
 pie and that maffle he had mentioned earlier.
 She attributed Ikebod's forward thinking to his long experience as servant
 to a noble house, very much so the Noble Representative's estate.
 No matter why or how, his timing was perfect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded to her and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'd advise you to start with some maffle, then savor a bit of the cherry

 It has a nice sour touch to it.
 Then I'd mix and match at will.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded appreciatively and happily dug in the maffle with a small fork.
 She felt genuinely happy and thankful there was time enough for her to
 enjoy a nice dessert.
 It reminded her of happier times, as if everything was alright in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her thoughts were disturbed by what seemed to be sounds akin to yelling
 and shouting coming from other parts of the house.
 She could hear there was some uproar, voices from rooms above conversing
 loudly.
 It was all too sudden.
 Ikebod was already leaving the kitchen.
 He turned to her as he stood at the open door:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please, stay here.
 I'll come back right away.
 Don't worry, you are safe.
 If we had been under attack I'd known from the sounds.
 There's some uproar that's all.
 Probably important news.
 I won't be long.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ikebod was at once gone from her sight.
 She returned her gaze to the table.
 The desserts were lying in her plate in front of her, half-eaten and unruly.
 She noticed she had not restrained herself from eating as she pleased,
 but she had rather enjoyed it.
 Which was only natural not to last forever, she thought.
 The dimly lit kitchen which had felt warm and full of wholesome smells,
 now seemed vacant, cold, dark.
 She felt like leaving the room immediately, and did so with some haste.
 She wanted to see and hear the news herself.
 Perhaps there was news about Amonas; her heart skipped a beat at the thought,
 but she brought her mind to its senses.
 That would not cause such an uproar.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Something awful's going to happen
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, she said to herself in a hushed voice that echoed uncomfortably inside
 the empty kitchen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She went through the corridor into the dinning-hall.
 She could hear voices from below, and she raced to the stairs leading to
 the waiting-room with wary expectation wrinkling her face.
 When she reached the feet of the stairs below, she could see Ikebod hurriedly
 conversing with three men, two of them clad in metal armor, and one of
 them bearing a disheveled cloak, with mud and perhaps blood on his face.
 The two men must have been guards and were being issued orders probably,
 nodding emphatically at something Ikebod was explaining.
 The other man was evidently fatigued, perhaps injured, and he seemed exhausted
 from running, breathing heavily, once every so often gulping down some
 water from a tall jug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She just stood there, not knowing if she should interrupt them, probably
 fearing she would ask something silly or impertinent.
 She thought that this was no time for being shy, and just called out for
 Ikebod, not harshly, but demanding his attention:
\end_layout

 After a brief pause of silence, Ikebod answered her:

He paused again, this time his face visibly contorted by a strange mix of
 exasperation and sorrow, his eyes torn between shedding tears of anger
 or rueful weeping.
 Celia was transfixed where she stood, her breath coming in shallower with
 every word Ikebod spoke.
 At length he continued:

I believe I have gathered conclusive evidence as to the function of the

 In fact, it can be safely proven by virtue of experimentation that these
 are in fact devices of a highly evolved civilization from an ancient past
 that perished long ago, leaving in its wake nothing but seemingly non-nondescri
pt memorabilia as the remains of a monumental metropolis located in the
 Widelands, as evidenced in the writings of Esphalon.
 I can honestly say that such an unprecedented work as I am engaged in currently

 had been watching Hilderich for what seemed to be the better part of an
 hour now.
 Hilderich was intently studying the surface they were standing on, as well
 as the base of the horns themselves.
 He kept clutching the keystone, scratching it with a finger at times.
 He seemed to be quite absorbed in thought.
 Amonas had felt he could not contribute at this time, and did not bother
 Hilderich with questions or other small talk.
 He saw no way out of this situation and certainly no way to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ride the flames
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as Hilderich had put it with enthusiasm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Amonas replayed what Hilderich had tried to explain to him, the idea
 seemed extravagantly far-fetched, more like a Curator's wild fantasy than
 anything that seemed to hold any ties with the realm of reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich insisted that they keystone was what would enable them to realize
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the plan
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The plan was to signal the flaming sphere, bullet, missile or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

train
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whatever one might call it, to stop and pick them up.
 Amonas thought that first and foremost, it was preposterous to consider
 that thing that rushed over their heads could be tamed, indeed made to
 stop.
 It sounded as if a man could command a falling star to cushion its fall,
 to peacefully glide to a stop so he could touch it.
 So the idea that one could actually even board such a thing defied any
 kind of logic Amonas could summon.
 Hilderich was either totally insane or on the brink of an ingenious discovery
 that could dwarf everything Amonas had seen, including the things that
 had been revealed to him when he stepped into the damnable pillar of light
 in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He truly hoped the latter case would hold true.
 In the meantime, while Hilderich seemed to be muttering to himself, pacing
 about the flat, matte black floor of the summit, Amonas' thoughts turned
 to Celia.
 Had she given birth? Was she safe? Had the uprising began? So little time
 had passed, but he was absent at a time that could prove to be the important
 one in history.
 He was afraid he would not be able to keep his promises to Celia.
 It all rested with Hilderich.
 It was a liberating emotion, in a sense, to have someone else hold the
 keys to your future.
 Someone else would to blame, someone else's success or failure was, in
 essence, what would gain him a trip back home or a slow, harrowing death
 filled with guilt, remorse and memories that would haunt him forever.
 But was it really only on Hilderich's efforts? Was there nothing he could
 do or think of? Had he given up on them already?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This damnable place afforded him no real rest, toying with his fears, his
 doubts, his ignorance.
 He threw a fist to the black floor, which remained unyielding, unbroken.
 The pain that swept up from his hand jogged him back into a more determined
 stance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if he had not the slightest idea about this place and the flaming sphere,
 Hilderich seemed to have at least some idea, something to follow through,
 something that could work.
 And if it didn't, they'd find something else, move on, think of another
 idea.
 Perhaps study the bullhorns in depth, find out their purpose.
 The land could support them, so they would keep on trying to get home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They would endure.
 All they had to do was endure and there would find a way.
 There must be a way.
 He'd do his best to help Hilderich, even if that meant he'd have to trust
 him with his life.
 They'd get back, that's all that mattered in his mind.
 He would get back home to Celia, and their child.
 He promised to himself he'd get back even if he'd have to walk back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clutches of reality were inescapable though and he snapped back to it
 when the sweat running down his forehead had turned into a small, steady
 trickle.
 The heat even under the shadows was uncomfortable.
 They did not have much in the way of water left, only a couple of the hard-skin
ned fruit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was wary of leaving Hilderich alone while he went back down to collect
 some more of the fruit, and perhaps locate some source of water.
 The fruit were watery enough, but their sweet taste would soon feel sickly
 if they kept consuming them all the time.
 He'd have to breach the subject sooner or later, but he decided to give
 Hilderich some more time with his musings first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did not know when the next flaming sphere would appear and that only
 served to increase Amonas' uneasiness.
 He believed it would be much more useful that they went down to the base
 of the bullhorns, where they could find shelter from the sun, as well as
 food and drink.
 He also thought that they could forage while going around the base of the
 bull-horned structure, which Hilderich was now calling 'horned pyramid',
 an architectural reference Amonas was not familiar with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway he thought that was a much more sound, safe, and logical plan.
 Hilderich had argued against it, saying that there should be enough time
 between passings for them to figure out how to use the flaming vehicle,
 and they should not wander away when they could be so close to escaping
 this place.
 Amonas had resisted the idea in more depth, by pointing out that even if
 that were so, they had not heard or seen the passing of such a thing ever
 since they arrived here, which would imply that whatever that thing was,
 it did not make frequent overpasses.

Hilderich counter-argued that as was the case with wagons and carriages,
 arrivals and departures did not have to be evenly spaced and sometimes
 schedules changed without notice, because of necessity.
 Amonas had left it that but they at least agreed to go down once their
 water supply had run out, rest, re-supply and at the same time search around
 the base of the horned pyramids for a possible way in.
 He hoped it would not come to that, but he was fairly sure that was a most
 optimistic view of things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich seemed to be lost in an inner circle of conjectures and theories
 that did not seem to produce any tangible practical benefits.
 At times he would stop and ask if Amonas had noticed anything new about
 the structure, especially the floor and the horns, and regrettably Amonas
 had quietly and calmly insisted that if he had noticed nothing new, and
 that if anything to that effect did happen he would surely notify him immediate
ly.
 Hilderich would then nod and go back to his calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had already paced around the edges of the floor, and had even walked
 over the shadows of the horns, seemingly measuring their length, for reasons
 Amonas could not even hope to infer.
 It seemed like utter charlatanism, a madman in the wilderness trying to
 make sense of something bewilderingly distant, like the suns or the stars,
 the color of the sky, and so on.
 But he would have to be patient and see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, they'd soon have to go down to the base of the pyramid for
 water, mostly.
 Hilderich must be feeling dry as sand by now, and he'd definitely developed
 a sunburn by now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The keystone in his hand was more like a sigil to him, a charm, something
 he had to connect himself with.
 He kept feeling for it, touching it, running his fingers around it, but
 he had yet to use it as a device, or as a measure or something that would
 seem somewhat pertinent.
 It was a greenish stone that gave off blue, almost turquoise reflections.
 It seemed to have a certain depth, a reflective quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be a raw gem, or something similar.
 Perhaps a glass, he couldn't be sure of its nature, and he certainly was
 no expert.
 It was just that it had a very strange appearance, one that could not be
 easily compared to whatever stone or gem he had seen or heard of.
 It must be really rare, Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rare enough for someone to keep collecting them, and rare enough to seal
 Olom's fate.
 He'd certainly miss him.
 Celia never knew, perhaps it was for the best.
 Now that he's really gone beyond..
 It was just, Amonas felt, a bit unfair on her.
 He felt guilty for not telling her, but it was a promise he would never
 break, and so did not.
 Perhaps, in time, he could find it in his heart to tell her the truth about
 her father.
 On second thought, he felt he was obligated to do so, actually.
 Just as soon as they got back.
 A time that seemed quite indeterminate at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas decided then that he had stay quiet long enough and at length asked
 Hilderich, who was standing almost at the far end of the summit, peering
 downwards over the edge:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Any progress?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich did not turn around, did not even stir or notion somehow.
 It seemed he was rather absorbed in thought.
 Amonas disliked shouting in principle, so he sighed and walked over to
 Hilderich.
 He noticed the man was standing at the lip of the summit, a step before
 falling over to the steps below.
 His arms were in front of him, the keystone in one hand, finger opening
 and closing in quick succession on the other.
 It looked as if he was counting something.
 Amonas cleared his throat audibly, more as a way to gather Hilderich's
 attention and perhaps guard him from a surprise that could set him off
 balance in a most precarious fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich paused in his counting momentarily, looked distracted for a moment,
 hastily checking his left and right with a small motion of his head, and
 then resumed counting, his fingers moving like playing the harp.
 Amonas closed his eyes in a show of mild exasperation, and said in his
 usual husky voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hilderich.
 I'm right here behind you.
 Hilderich..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich paused, and turned about slowly, a frown of surprise on his face.
 As he did so, he instinctively made a backwards motion with his head back,
 tipping his upper torso slightly aft.
 That was enough to jerk him off his feet, towards the slope of steps he
 was surveying.
 Arms flailing wildly in a vain effort to steady himself, he clutched the
 keystone hard to his chest and stretched out his free hand as a desperate
 last ditch attempt to reach Amonas who was no more than two steps away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas reacted instinctively with cat-like speed and lunged forward, making
 just one step forward and bending his body slightly towards the ground,
 making a kneeling motion that brought his center of mass lower, stretching
 out both of his hands, one reaching for Hilderich's arm and one for his
 shirt about his waist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A still moment passed when Hilderich seemed doomed to fall and tumble down
 like a rag doll to his almost certain death and most certain grievous injury,
 with Amonas failing to do anything other than watch, his grasp failing
 by hair's breadth.
 His mind was much faster than his body, so the terrible thought had time
 enough to coalesce with feelings of guilt and failure, curses and a repetitive
 voice that seemed to echo from afar, a simple form of denial, yet so piercing
 that it lanced right through his head, even before he could think he had
 uttered it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas stood there in a kneeling position, his body tense, almost rigid.
 He just sat there transfixed, wide-eyed and out of breath, his last one
 cut suddenly short.
 He gasped for air, and only then did he realize he was holding onto Hilderich
 shirt and palm.
 Not very tightly, but he could feel some of Hilderich's body weight pulling
 at him.
 He came to his senses and pulled back, edging Hilderich closer.
 He grabbed tighter with one hand and pulled harder, bringing Hilderich
 right back on his feet, safely on the summit's surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich looked surprise, the frown on his face even narrower.
 He had certainly began to show signs of sunburn.
 Perhaps he was stricken from the sun and the light, and got dizzy all of
 a sudden when I called out to him, Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was looking about the floor, his hands going through his pockets.
 Something seemed amiss to Amonas.
 Hilderich cried out suddenly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The keystone! It must have fell off! I need to go get it!The keystone!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas took him by his arms and spoke to him calmly, steadily, an hint of
 assurance in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We are going to get the keystone.
 We were running out of water anyway.
 Perhaps you were out on the sun for too long.
 Don't worry, no one's going to steal it from you.
 There's just us around here.
 I'm sure it's somewhere down there.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was forcing Hilderich to look him in the eyes, to convey a sense
 of safety, security and calm.
 It was as if Hilderich was going through the shock of battle.
 Was the keystone so vital to him? To their survival? Was the keystone that
 sensitive, prone to damage? Had their chance to return home tumbled down
 into oblivion by the slip of a foot? He shouldn't take it as granted.
 Everything in its right time, Amonas thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich turned around to look at the steps below, searching for the keystone,
 this time with a healthier distance from the lip.
 He put a hand up to offer his eyes some shade, but still he squinted as
 he tried to make out such a small thing from such a distance.
 He was obviously disgruntled with what happened, and after some more searching
 in vain, he turned around to Amonas and told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We have to go down now, Amonas.
 It could be coming any time now, the keystone is crucial.
 Please, I'll explain to you on the way down.
 I think I know how it works.
 Please, we need to go find it now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright, alright don't fret.
 We were going anyhow.
 I'm sure it's not as far down as you fear.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas jogged briskly to pick up his sack that was lying under the shadow
 of a horn, and as he came back to Hilderich, he produced one of their last
 two 'brown ones' from the sack.
 He chopped of one end and gave it to Hilderich, then got out the last,
 did the same and they both drank greedily.
 As they went about the lip ready to start their descend, Amonas told Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Remember, once we find the keystone, we continue down to the base.
 We need water, and you'll feel it yourself in a pretty bad way until we
 get down.
 The sun here is scorching hot, we'll need shadow, water and sleep once
 we get down.
 Then we search around the base.
 Like we agreed, is that alright Hilderich?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was hesitant, almost reticent to answer but at length he must
 have thought about it in a more sensible way, so then he nodded and started
 climbing down carefully but briskly.
 Soon, Hilderich was making good speed, seeing that going down was much
 easier because one could easily slide across the surface of the steps with
 his bottom, then dangle his feet and make a little jump onto the step below
 and so on.
 It might even be a fun, merry activity, especially if they were children
 and if the sun wasn't trying to boil them alive.
 Amonas found out Hilderich's unorthodox way of descending the step to be
 quite efficient and fast, so he copied it and they were both making good
 progress, rapidly descending steps.
 At each step Hilderich would peer left and right quickly but certain enough
 that not a glimmer of the keystone caught his eye.
 Amonas had advised him to talking, breath through his nose and tell him
 all about what he had come up with when they got down.
 It was supposedly a good way to conserve one's water, but Hilderich at
 one point told Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If we miss it on the way down, we're walking from corner to corner of the
 pyramid, each step up the way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I doubt we can do that with no shadow to protect us from the heat.
 We were exhausted when we climbed up the shadowy face.
 We'd be sun-burnt to death if we walked every inch of this side.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

No keystone, no ride Amonas.
 We'll have to if we don't find it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas did not reply and instead carried on climbing down, and put himself
 in the lead.
 At length, after a little while, and while Amonas they had already climbed
 down half the steps, Hilderich cried out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There! Over there! I've found it!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas stopped to look as Hilderich ran across the step towards the keystone.
 He knelt down and seemed to examine it closely from every side, look for
 signs of damage or any chipping he might hope to collect.
 Instead he found a perfectly shaped keystone, and what appeared to be a
 small dent on the steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It appeared quite strange to him that the keystone could actually do that,
 if the stone was indeed the cause for the dent.
 He decided he'd better try something like that later on.
 It perplexed him at a time when he thought he had most things figured out.
 It didn't seem that important, but it was too strange even under the circumstan
ces.
 He let the thought go for the moment, and when he stood upright again he
 was smiling, waving his hand with the keystone tightly gripped, and cried
 out to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It is fine! Impeccable as ever! Not a scratch!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Glad to hear it.
 Now come, let's make haste.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was indeed glad to hear but he was not sharing Hilderich's enthusiasm.
 He had yet to understand the importance of the stone.
 The only thing that stood to reason and supported somewhat Hilderich's
 claims was that someone had been collecting keystones in every way.
 It had even cost Olom's life, and perhaps other lives had been lost in
 a similar manner as well.
 Perhaps, the keystones were parts of ancient technology that had yet to
 be made working again.
 Perhaps not all keystones were as important, and some were different unique.
 Perhaps they were all unique, indispensable parts to a whole.
 He couldn't know, and he couldn't imagine what Hilderich had come up with.
 It would all remain a mystery until they could get back.
 He reminded himself that first and foremost, he had to get back.
 And right now, he thought, I have to keep myself from drying out.
 And so they descended, with a bit more speed now that Hilderich had secured
 the keystone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun had taken its toll on them; they were sweating profusely, their
 bodies glimmering with perspiration under the hard greenish light of the
 lone sun.
 By now, they had both been sun-burnt, their skins bordering the color of
 the meat underneath.
 Hilderich seemed to be in a much sorrier state than Amonas, his every movement
 by now painfully evident on his face, and with each thrust of pain from
 his limbs making him flinch in reflex and aggravate his pain, the skin
 of his face wrinkled and coarse like a thick sheet of paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas came to his side and tried to help him a bit, lending some of his
 strength for Hilderich to go down the stairs.
 Hilderich at first seemed glad to be offered some relief, but then cried
 in pain and waved Amonas to leave him be.
 Before he resumed his painful descent, he told Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It hurts, everywhere you might touch me it hurts.
 I have to do this alone.
 I ache all over.
 Even speaking hurts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded his acknowledgement and looked sympathetic, understanding.
 He replied kindly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright, Hilderich.
 You can see the trees now, can't you? We're not that far off, just a few
 more dozens of steps.
 And then..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was cut in mid-sentence when Hilderich collapsed from what must have
 been a deadly mixture of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and searing pain.
 He lunged forward, head over heels his hands gnawing at the air for an
 instant as if trying to catch on invisible ropes, and then they fell limp,
 together with the rest of his body.
 Amonas did not have time to react like before, and this time Hilderich
 went tumbling down the steps in a state of unconsciousness, no control
 over his fall and no protection.
 He seemed to fall really badly on the first step, his chest thudding on
 impact, and then swiveling slightly to his side, he rolled two, maybe three
 steps before coming to a stop, his limbs sprawled at almost impossible
 angles.
 Amonas feared the worst and came rushing down the steps as fast as he could
 without challenging a similar fate.
 The way he fell, Amonas thought he might have broken almost every bone.
 He hoped his head was as intact as it seemed, and that he would be able
 to move him.
 When he got there, Hilderich was not communicating.
 He tried crying out to him, but he could not rouse him.
 He was definitely unconscious, probably the reason for him collapsing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He did not know which bones on Hilderich's body were broken, but nothing
 seemed to jut out gruesomely, so that meant that if something was broken,
 it was not visibly.
 He tried to feel Hilderich arms and legs, as well as his ribs, but he was
 not an expert man of medicine and he could not make any seriously correct
 assessment.
 He believed his arms and legs were fine, but some of his ribs felt funny
 and might be broken.
 He might be in pain when he woke up, but he could still walk probably.
 Under the circumstances, he felt he should be counting Hilderich's blessings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With strenuous effort he managed to lift Hilderich's waist on his right
 shoulder, his body laid out so as to bear the least burden on his probably
 broken ribs.
 Amonas' movements became difficult and strained, with Hilderich's limp
 body seemingly protesting at their every move, feet and legs getting in
 the way, sliding uncomfortably along the steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas felt very close to collapsing himself under the strain and the heat,
 but he pushed on heedlessly nevertheless, trying to make it to the tree-line
 which was only a few dozen feet away.
 He was coming down the last steps, when Hilderich started coming around,
 moaning deeply from the numbing pain.
 He managed to croak a whisper, while wheezing, his breath troubled:
\end_layout

 exaggeratedly harsh, literally dried out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You fainted and fell down the steps.
 You've broken some ribs.
 Don't talk.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was silent again.
 Amonas thought he might have fainted again, but that was not his principle
 care.
 They had to make it to the tree-line and the little shadow it offered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was walking over the canal-like indentation on the ground, tall grass
 around him, dragging his feet with admirable effort and determination.
 His face was contorted from the pain of his aching muscles and the extra
 weight they had had to carry for these last few minutes.
 A little while longer, Amonas kept thinking to himself.
 A little while longer into the shadow, and I can rest.
 He closed his eyes and kept on walking with the same pace, Hilderich slung
 over his shoulder like game, him gritting his teeth, his breaths coming
 short and hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When at last he reached the relative shadow of the trees, he could still
 feel the heat, but the scorching rays of the sun were gone, dwindled as
 if kept at bay by the forest.
 With one last bit of effort, he knelt down to the ground and offloaded
 Hilderich as carefully as he could, trying not to hurt him much.
 Hilderich came to for a moment, moaned deeply and grimaced from pain, and
 then was out again, his breathing shallow, as if his body knew anything
 more would hurt like stabs of red hot iron in his lungs.
 Amonas then braced Hilderich from under his armpits with both arms, trying
 not to cause him any more pain, and dragged him over to the wide trunk
 of a tree, propping him up against, so he could breathe without fear of
 drowning.
 He felt he could do nothing more for Hilderich for the time being, so he
 crawled a bit farther away under the shadow of a tree with a bark as wide
 the wall of a cabin, closed his eyes and just slept without dreaming a
 single thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
He opened his eyes to the sight of the green canopy, a labyrinth of shades
 of green, large and smaller branches criss-crossing it like a net cast
 out onto a sea of leaves.
 His mouth was parched, he felt his head heavy, a headache pounding his
 mind like a hammer on an anvil.
 He was thirsty, he needed water.
 Hilderich was still unconscious it seemed, just laying there, his breathing
 laborious, a raspy, unhealthy sound.
 He needed a doctor.
 They needed to get back to civilization, back home.
 Amonas judged Hilderich was in no shape to walk around the base of the
 pyramid.
 The most immediate need was water though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas stood up with a lot of effort.
 He felt disoriented, his senses failing him, his vision slightly blurry,
 unfocused.
 He misjudged the location and distance of things around him.
 The dehydration must have been more severe than he had felt it.
 And the heat was only making things worse.
 He slowly paced himself through an opening in the vegetation, a path that
 offered less thick greenery, more easy terrain.
 He was looking for the, usual by now, tree with the brown nut-fruit, the
 one with all the watery juice inside, but couldn't see any.
 The trees did look a bit different, as if this was another part of the
 forest, less thick, with more space.
 Fewer but larger trees, wider openings and more upwards space.
 Like a vast hall, supported on wooden pillars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But no fruit.
 Or something else to eat, most importantly no water.
 He could still make out the clearing in front of the base of the pyramid
 where Hilderich lay.
 He had not gotten very far, though he felt already tired, worn out.
 The dehydration was severe now.
 He paused and sat by the exposed root of a tree.
 He thought it was too dangerous to venture farther away from the pyramid
 and Hilderich.
 He was looking up, a vast net-like congregation of saplings extending from
 one tree to the other, like ropes meant to build a bridge.
 They were probably carrying water or some juice, but he could not reach
 them, they were too high up.
 He'd need to try and climb up a tree like a mad cat, and he was certainly
 in no condition to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then turned to the thick root he was sitting up against.
 It looked healthy and vital not gnarled.
 A young root, a young tree.
 There should be some water flowing through it, he thought.
 He brought out his knife and tried to put a stab to the root, deep enough
 to go through its skin to the veins of the tree.
 Hopefully some water would seep, at least enough for him to drink now,
 make him able to go on, search further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stabbed as hard as he could, then worked his knife, twisting and bending
 it as if trying to cut out the tree's heart.
 At length, pieces of the root came out with a strong, pungent smell, something
 like oil glistening on the knife's blade.
 Amonas ran a finger on it and sampled it, the taste woody and bitter.
 It felt indeed more like oil rather than water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With some more effort, his head now feeling like a ministry bell tolling
 incessantly, he dug deeper into the root, trying to get past its meaty
 part, into the core of it, where water coursed.
 He dug with his knife, and his hands, feeling the oils giving way to moist,
 soft wood matter.
 A final chip with the blade, and he saw a trickle coursing down, dripping
 on the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With sudden greed, he put his mouth on the wound he had inflicted on the
 root, and sucked like a newborn baby.
 It was water after all.
 He wet his lips and his mouth thoroughly, letting the cool liquid refresh
 his flesh, and spat it out.
 He then let the trickle fill his mouth, while he filled the two flasks
 he was carrying, patiently waiting for the trickle of water to fill them
 drop by drop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the while, he sat more comfortably, leaning against the trunk of the
 tree, almost as if ready to take nap.
 He swallowed small portions of the water in his mouth, savoring it.
 He had been dehydrated before, and knew it was a lot of worse if a man
 that had been denied of water for too long, just dived straight in a lake
 or drank to his heart's content.
 He had seen men die of it, for reasons he could not know, or even the doctors
 explain.
 He thought it was a sick way of nature to make men pay for their greed
 as well as their lack of respect to water, and thinking about how important
 it is to them from beforehand.
 The irony was, he had been none the wiser, barely carrying an extra flask
 with him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mind did not wander or drift as it had done so before in the days before.
 Necessity drove him, and his instincts.
 He took things as they were, his mind enjoying a numbness while both it
 and his body recuperated slowly, the effects of the dehydration slowly
 withering away, vigor reappearing in his face, his head throbbing gently
 instead of being about to explode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the flasks were filled to the brim, he had drank a couple more mouthfuls
 by now.
 He was feeling markedly better, and he believed he could find another such
 root with more wandering, but with no way to carry more water, it would
 be in vain.
 So he decided to get back to Hilderich, and tend to him, rouse him, and
 give him badly needed water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he got back to where Hilderich was sitting, he tried speaking to him
 to rouse him, shake his head, but to no avail.
 Then he used some of the water, letting it run down on Hilderich head,
 face, and back, dousing him carefully so as not to waste a lot of it.
 The cool water slowly coursing Hilderich's body had more effect.
 He fluttered his eyes momentarily and then gasped, and a sting of a pain
 immediately ran through him, the bones in his ribs stabbing him without
 warning.
 Amonas offered him the flask of water and told him in a soothing, reassuring
 manner:
\end_layout

\end_inset

Breathe lightly, or it'll hurt like death each time.
 You have broken some ribs, that much is now certain.
 You are dehydrated, your head must spin and hurt like being swung at with
 a mallet.
 I am too, only I drank some water and feel good enough to stand on my two
 feet.
 Now, you just sip some of this very slowly and carefully.
 Don't gulp down on it, it might kill you, and I'm not known for my humorist
 streaks.
 Now flex a bit your arms and legs if you can, you've been lying there for
 hours, your muscles will go dead stiff if you don't.
 We'll wait it out, you'll drink till you feel a bit better and then perhaps
 I can make you a splint out of some wood I might rummage.
 How does all that sound?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich managed to lift his head and look at Amonas briefly.
 He was evidently in a lot of pain, and in a pretty poor state.
 He needed genuine rest and this was not the place for it.
 Hilderich nodded silently in acknowledgement, and Amonas smiled bitterly.
 He said then:

If you agree then, let's keep to that plan.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich seemed then to be trying to flex and move a bit his arms and legs.
 But one hand he laid on Amonas arm, who was kneeling down beside him, and
 then rasped in a low whisper:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The..

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded once more wearily, his head moving imperceptibly.
 He managed to say something else after he sipped on some water:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was insisting that Amonas listened to what he had to say, tugging
 his cloak with a grip that belied his feebleness and injuries.
 He spoke with a rasp, his throat still too dry for comfort:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The keystone.
 The wall.
 They're like water and sand.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas furrowed his brow intensely, puzzled at what seemed a very vague
 half-statement especially when coming from Hilderich.
 He motioned Hilderich to shush himself, putting a finger to his mouth,
 but Hilderich went on, in spite himself, after coughing with what appeared
 to be blood in his sputum:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know it doesn't make sense.
 The stone can be absorbed into the wall.
 It is a keystone.
 The wall is a door.
 It should work.
 Please, try it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded condescendingly and said:

\end_inset

You can try all you want to when you get better.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich gave off another cough and a splutter of bloody saliva forced
 him to look away from Amonas.
 He then turned his face again to look into Amonas eyes, wheezed while breathing
 harshly and told him, this time with what seemed to aggravation in his
 voice, even annoyance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You need to listen to me! Use the key, force it into the pyramid's wall,

 Let it be drawn into the pyramid.

Where have you been getting these ideas Hilderich? You must be delirious,
 running a fever surely.
 Please, stop exerting your self and drink some water.
 Here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Hilderich's face was suddenly contorted, wildly disfigured from anger
 and despair at the same time, and with a jerk he threw the open flask Amonas
 proffered away, spewing its precious water content along its flight.
 He was now talking fast, anger in his voice, pain underlining every word,
 gasping between every phrase:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not listening! You think I'm seeing things! I saw the keystone left
 a dent on the stone, a bump that wasn't there before.
 There is some affinity with the pyramid stones.
 What are you going to lose if you try? Your vaunted pride? If you don't
 do it now, there's every chance we are going to miss the next fireball
 and that might be our last! Do you want to die here? Use the keystone!
 Find a way in!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas made a backwards step, like being physically pushed and had to re-balance
 himself.
 His face wore an expression of disbelief, hints of feeling awkward, hurt.
 He felt like he had been lied upon, whereas he had trusted Hilderich almost
 unflinchingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But you said it was like hitching a wagon, that there's a schedule and so

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich coughed once more, his lips now red with his blood:

Haven't you heard of wishful thinking before?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas stood up while staring down at Hilderich, accusation in the tone
 of his voice, a finger pointing at him waveringly, as if he wasn't sure
 whether this man was to be blamed or not:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You..

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich rasped once more, this time with more volume in his voice, making
 it sound rather inhuman and menacing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You wouldn't know your head from your arse.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich looked at Amonas with fiery eyes that stung and looked as if embers
 were burning inside, and told him slowly, painfully, with fear, pain and
 real anger showing on his face and in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just push it through the wall! Like driving a nail! Gods dammit!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He coughed once more, blood spewing forth, running down his lips and chin.
 Amonas thought that since he could do nothing more, he could perhaps indulge
 him and that might bring some sense into him.
 He nodded without genuine assent, stoop upright and walked to where the
 flask had landed.
 He picked it up, exchanged strenuous looks with Hilderich and carried on
 to the wall of the pyramid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he reached it, feeling the sun blazing hot upon him, he took some time
 to study it.
 He could not hope to really understand to what purpose it was made, the
 fiery bolt that ran through the horns before only adding to the puzzle.
 The black matte stones were strange, glass-like to the touch, but hard,
 not brittle.
 Not much of all that had transpired made any sense though, either.
 So he just did as Hilderich told me, took the keystone and placed its longer
 side flat on the stone that stood right in front of him, forming the first
 step, waist-high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing happened, as expected of something that the delusional mind of a
 seriously injured man had come up with.
 Then, for the sake of proper procedure and carrying out the idea to the
 letter, he pushed the keystone down with one hand, feeling quite unwarrantably
 stupid.
 As he pressed down momentarily he somehow felt the keystone give way.
 He let it go, and then used his index finger to press ever so lightly.
 Nothing that his senses could grasp ensued, and he kept on pressing slightly
 harder and harder, when after a certain threshold, the keystone indeed
 gave way and it seemed to bury itself gradually in the black stone.
 To his untold surprise, once he had indeed pressed it halfway deep into
 the black stone, the green keystone lit up with a rainbow of colors cast
 from an inner light that could not have been a reflection of the sun, as
 his shadow was blocking it.
 It was as if somehow the stone had come alive.
 Unable to contain his surprise and sudden enthusiasm, Amonas started yelling
 back towards Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You were right! It's doing something alright!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flaring lights suddenly stopped, and the keystone remained inert, half
 way there into the black surface of the pyramid's blocky stone step.
 Amonas did not know what to do next.
 An instinctive fear raced through his mind, preventing him from even moving
 or thinking.
 He stood there almost impassively, not knowing what to do next, fearing
 the unknowns that he had been hunting down.
 It was ironic that now that he was able to actually progress past theory,
 thought and conjecture into something that seemed to work, react, do something
 even though it remained unknown, he had frozen.
 From his basic, human fear of the unknown.
 He knew he had to focus his mind, force himself past such notions.
 So, with his indecision hidden away he touched the half-buried keystone,
 one more time with his palm, and then it was gone, like being swallowed
 by the blackness of the stones alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the most amazing thing he had seen, only comparable with the fireball
 from before, unraveled before his eyes with astonishing speed and seeming
 complexity.
 The stones in front of him became somewhat transparent, letting some light
 through.
 Their smooth surface became crystallized, faceted, rough, but not coarse
 and random.
 It looked rather like wrinkled paper that was folded a thousand, a million
 times and then laid out again, perfectly patterned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stones started to part, dissolve, each little part of absorbed by the
 facets next to it, like the stones were eating themselves away.
 The sight reminded him of a half-frozen lake being shattered and the ice
 sinking down instead of floating though in a very fast and methodical way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This transfiguration, this certain proof of the otherworldliness of the
 place, was over before Amonas could even blink twice.
 And what was left in the place of the stones, was a corridor as if carved
 in the stones, wide enough and tall enough for a man of Amonas size to
 walk in.
 He was stunned from awe, unable to fully comprehend what he had witnessed.
 It was as if magic was as real as the ground, as real as stones and air
 and the sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With some effort, he gathered his wits and cast aside the protests of his
 mind to see, and hear and touch and wonder wide-eyed at this inexplicable,
 majestic building that challenged reason every time.
 He focused on the harsh reality and its necessities, and peered over the
 half-lit entrance that had not been there moments before.
 He could see no lights coming from within, no other sort of emplacements
 or provisions for torched or the like.
 It was pitch black in there, but the important thing was that it was now
 open.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instinctively he thought about the newly built entrance closing suddenly
 in a manner similar to how it had been opened and trapping him inside,
 or even worse trapping half of him inside.
 He made two quick steps back, as if he had been warned in advance, but
 nothing happened.
 He shook his head in disbelief and disapproval of himself.
 They had a way in and that was all it mattered, though.
 There was a way in and Hilderich was right.
 They had to move inside now, and that meant moving Hilderich as well.
 That would be troublesome, Amonas thought as he made quite a few steps
 backwards before running to Hilderich, almost unable to let the sight of
 the wondrous entrance depart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was still propped up against the trunk of the tree, wheezing as
 he drew his breath with painstaking effort.
 Amonas noticed he was grinning now though, and his spirits flared high
 anew.
 With a broad smile he knelt next to Hilderich and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It worked you were right.
 Once the keystone went in, an entrance opened up as if by magic, a wondrous
 affair.
 Filled me with awe and that rarely if ever happens.
 You should be proud of yourself, Hilderich.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich flinched painfully as he repositioned himself in a more upright
 position using his hands and replied, grunting some of the words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I shouldn't be in this..
 mess.
 Then..
 I could be proud.
 The..
 keystone? Do you have it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas face turned into ash and froze at that question.
 In the tumult, amidst all the surprise and awe, he had forgotten all about
 the keystone, that had just disappeared into the stone.
 That made him uneasy.
 He licked his lips with his tongue, and tasted his sour sweat.
 He had no answer that might quieten Hilderich's fear, so he simply told
 him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 It went into the stone, the entrance into the pyramid opened, and that
 was all.
 The keystone did not reappear.
 I'm sorry.
 I think it has served its purpose.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's face lit up somewhat and then he burst into a painful mix of
 choked laughter and blood-sputtering coughing.
 He tensed up and restrained himself, the pain from his broken ribs becoming
 unbearable while he laughed.
 He grimaced while the waves of pain coursing through him settled down,
 took a shallow breath and replied to Amonas, who was now sitting down with
 his legs woven together, looking quite perplexed with Hilderich's strange
 reaction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You talk as if..
 it were alive.
 Could be, for all I know.
 That's alright..

 Made me..
 laugh.

 pensive.
 Almost, mourning.
 The keystone's fine, you'll see.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas face relaxed and he seemed to accept Hilderich's thoughts as if they
 made sense.
 In any other context, he would still believe the man was making up things
 in his mind, but he now felt indeed compelled to take Hilderich's every
 word seriously.
 He couldn't know why, but he had been right so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright, Hilderich.
 So, now we have to figure a way to get you in as well.
 It only fits one man about my size.
 That means I won't be able to carry you through on my shoulder like I did
 back then.
 How are you feeling? Have you had any more water to drink? If there's no
 water left I can always go back and hack at some root, fill up the flasks.
 Hope you don't throw half of it away though this time.

Amonas shook his head briskly in acknowledgement, but insisted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see that Hilderich, but I need to know if you can move on your own

 You also need water.

 I'll fill both later, somehow.

Hilderich grinned and replied:

My head is still buzzing..
 I feel weaker than an ant, but..

 Something to..

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas waved Hilderich's last remark away with one hand and looked him up
 and down, thoughtfully, as if measuring him.
 Then, he looked around him, trying to identify something around him within
 sight that he could put to good use.
 He said to Hilderich while standing up, his head darting in every direction,
 searching for anything that he could use.
 At length, he asked Hilderich with a certain degree of hesitation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will a sort of harness do? Something I could wrap under your armpits, around
 your shoulders too perhaps? It should hurt anyway I go about it, but I
 think it's the most practical thing I believe I could manage in reasonable
 time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich looked at his feet, sprawled as they were, his vision evidently
 out of focus.
 He seemed lost in thought, but then he coughed, still traces of blood in
 his saliva and replied to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Whatever makes sense to you.
 I'm pretty..
 useless at these crafts, so I'll make do..

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded with a slightly comforting smile, and hurried away, headed
 to a cluster of trees and bush that Hilderich could not clearly make out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich' body was constantly assaulted from the heat and moisture that
 had only been bearable under the shadow of the bullhorn pyramid.
 Now, with his ribs broken, his skin sun-burnt and his body dehydrated,
 he felt like someone had left out his mind to dry over white hot sand and
 stone.
 And every breath felt like he had been dismantled and put back somehow
 wrong, the bones in his ribs turned into blades set against his insides,
 stabbing him every chance they got.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His throat felt like a dusty canyon and what little saliva was left in him
 was bloody and thick.
 He needed more water, that was true.
 But more than anything else he needed to get in there.
 Get in the pyramid.
 See for himself.
 After all, he thought Amonas could not make it without him, he'd have no
 chance to understand what surrounded him.
 But in this sorry state, they both needed each other, more badly then ever
 before.
 He just decided to wait though, and in doing so slowly and despite the
 constantly painful and irritating coughing, fell asleep fitfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas woke him up, gently shaking his leg.
 He woke up without really wanting to, and saw Amonas had indeed prepared
 a sort of harness, a piece of paraphernalia that must have been tacked
 together while he was asleep.
 It was made out of thick straggles of some kind of vine that seemed to
 be abundant here, a somewhat flat branch of sappy wood, and a quite large,
 thick deep green leave, shaped like a flattened arrow's nose.
 Amonas was grinning, as if he had intended for this appurtenance of sorts
 to look like an exotic mule's rein, and was certain that the irony would
 not go wasted on Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich indeed looked at what Amonas had fashioned, and though still in
 a sort of after-sleep haze, he managed to point at it and snigger, as opposed
 to laughing outright which was rather painful.
 Amonas came closer and holding the various parts together told Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, I know what you're thinking since you're in such a good mood, but any
 similarity with a donkey's strap and rein is purely unintentional and simply
 a product of the same basic design principles that define both pieces of
 gear.
 I'm sure you would agree in the end, but let's try and get this on now,
 shall we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded in agonizing agreement, and Amonas grabbed him by the arms
 and lifted him upwards, propping him upright against the trunk of the tree.
 Hilderich let out a cry of pain as his ribs must have had his insides jarred
 once more.
 Amonas tried to be quick about it since he saw Hilderich was barely able
 to stand, much less walk.
 He placed the branch of wood as a backplate, a support to keep his torso,
 chest and ribs strict and unbent, to prevent further aggravating his wounds
 inside, as well keeping the bones somewhat steady, if they were to build
 a proper splint once they went back and found a doctor.
 The prospect seemed ever closer now, and filled Amonas with ardor.
 He completed fastening the gear on Hilderich, binding the ropes and setting
 the large leaf across Hilderich's back, as a sort of cushioning, without
 which he believed he'd be unable to move him more than a foot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he was finished, he lowered Hilderich down to the ground again, and
 then passed the other end of the rope around his waist belt and tightened
 it.
 He said to Hilderich who was evidently uncomfortable, his arms sticking
 out in a weird fashion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Ready when you are.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded in a disgruntled fashion and Amonas then started to move,
 at first rather sluggish, but soon he was able to walk slowly with Hilderich
 in tow.
 Soon, they reached the large ditch which proved somewhat of a pain because
 of the angled banks.
 Hilderich almost slipped down and Amonas barely avoided being dragged down
 and falling head first into the ditch.
 In a similar fashion, heading up the ditch put evident strain on Amonas,
 who reached the entrance with Hilderich behind him, sweating and out of
 breath.
 He stopped a few steps behind the actual entrance and gestured at it with
 one hand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This is it.
 You were right.
 It just, sprouted open in a most perplexing way.
 The stones acted on their own, remoulded themselves somehow.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was still attached to Amonas via the makeshift harness, and was
 craning his neck in an effort to somehow see better inside the passageway
 that led deeper inside the pyramid.
 He told Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let's go in.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded in agreement and started to walk inside.
 As he reached the foot of the entrance, he noticed the passageway in front
 of him starting to flicker and shine.
 It was doing it again, the stones in the structure were rearranging themselves,
 like before.
 Hilderich let out a gasp of surprise and enthusiasm and asked Amonas instantly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is that what it did before? That's wondrous! It makes way for us! The passage
 is wider now! Look!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what it looked like, the corridor was widened a bit more to more easily
 accommodate Hilderich as well.
 Amonas was surprised once more, but he wasn't feeling mesmerized this time.
 He believed though it would take him awhile to greet this is as normal.
 Without further ado, he took a few steps more, and they were both now inside
 the pyramid proper.
 The sunlight could not reach them here and a cool fresh air greeted them.
 They were following a corridor that seemed to glow faintly from within
 its walls, strangely illuminating their way as they walked through it,
 a spot of soft light between harsh darkness.
 As it was they could not see very far into the pyramid, the radius of lighting
 comfortable enough it simply followed them and did not extend beyond a
 few feet.
 Amonas stopped then, and asked Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you sure we should be going inside like this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was looking with amazement around the walls and the ceiling, the
 black matte stone having turned into a semi-transparent glass, the light
 casting hues and specks reminiscent of a artisan glass-work, perhaps even
 a gemstone.
 It took Hilderich a while to respond to Amonas question, but he did so
 in a gleeful voice despite the condition he was in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

More than ever! It's a wonder in itself, this material!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich coughed then and spat some more saliva with blood.
 Amonas trudged onwards bearing Hilderich in tow and simply said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just be patient, Hilderich.
 We're getting somewhere.
 The draught is getting stronger somehow.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was indeed a matter of a few more minutes spent in silence and awe, before
 they reached a sullen, gloomy opening, with a single column of light shattering
 the darkness, illuminating a blocky metal or stone artifact, its surface
 a mirror with a bronze-like sheen.
 Amonas was awestruck when he saw his image reflected on that surface, even
 while there was still a wide gap of shadow between them and the artifact.
 Hilderich noticed Amonas had paused and asked him in what seemed to be
 like a worrisome voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why did you stop? Is something the matter? What do you see? I only see blackness.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas replied while still measuring and looking at the block of stone,
 a monolith of sorts, his voice a low whisper, like men fearful of awakening
 something terrible:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a block made of, something like stone, metal, or glass.
 Something like the rest of what this place is built from, but not quite
 so.
 It can..
 See me.
 Through the darkness.
 My reflection is right there.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich went silent with thought after Amonas' answer.
 Amonas waited for Hilderich to make a remark, perhaps give some advice,
 but he said nothing.
 He said then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll just walk over there.
 If it was dangerous, it wouldn't have let us in, would it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich answered with some uncertainty trailing his words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That would be quite illogical, so I'd have to agree with your..
 assessment.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich coughed right before the last word, pain traveling up his throat
 feeling as if it was about to choke him, his lungs burning.
 He was almost used to the pain now, but that did not make things much easier
 for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas did not reply but simply headed for the bright area where the monolith
 stood, the reflection of Amonas on its surface beginning to look somewhat
 strange.
 Firstly, Amonas noticed it did not reflect the harness or the bulk of Hilderich
 that should be visible.
 Secondly, the reflection did not seem to grow larger the closer he came
 to the stone.
 It seemed to be the same size as Amonas, all along, from when he noticed
 it first.
 He thought to himself he should be feeling wary by now, but all he felt
 was puzzlement, interest.
 Fear had not crossed his mind, which was either a good sign, or extremely
 stupid of him.
 If they were in danger, he had no such notion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was mysteriously silent, but then again his injuries made it that
 difficult to speak his mind as Amonas would've thought he should have been
 doing constantly since they had entered the pyramid, especially now with
 this intriguing artifact laid out before them.
 Hilderich then took him by surprise when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tell me.
 What do you see on the stone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas was surprised and stopped.
 Light was shining down on them, bright and white, but not hurtful to the
 eyes.
 As if it poured from around them, not from the ceiling of this chamber
 or cavern the size of which they could rightly assess.
 They had noticed no echoes whatsoever, and their eyes could not see beyond
 the illuminated area around the monolith.
 They could be anywhere.
 Amonas responded, offering a simple description to Hilderich:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's about twice my height, thrice my width.
 It looks black, but that's not exactly right.
 It gives off a feeling of glass, and has a bronze sheen.
 I can see my reflection on it, imperfect, like what it would like through
 a thick sheet of cheap glass.
 I look somewhat deformed, a honey-like hue on my image.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich took a few moments to digest that information, and asked Amonas
 again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you see me in that reflection? Shouldn't you be seeing me?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't.
 I think not even the harness is visible.
 But I can see myself talking, waving an arm and such.
 It's uncanny, I'll admit.
 Like someone is standing there.
 Mocking me.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich shuffled where he lay, and said to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Please, help me stand.
 I need to have a good look.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

We're only wasting time.
 If I need to make some observations, I need to do them myself.
 Please.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas then lowered Hilderich carefully and undid the ropes.
 He unclasped the wood on Hilderich's back, and offered Hilderich his hands.
 They embraced, arm with arm, and Amonas gave a questioning nod.
 Hilderich nodded in acknowledgement, and Amonas pulled him upwards hard
 and fast, so as to minimize the after-effects of splintered bone against
 Hilderich's raw flesh.
 It didn't work all that well and while Hilderich was gripping Amonas' shoulders
 for support, he almost fainted from the stabbing pain, his cry splitting
 the silence in the chamber in two, but still no echo.
 His shook his head as if trying to shake the pain away, and after a few
 more moments of shallow breathing he managed to stand on his two feet,
 and slowly turn around to look at the monolith himself, Amonas supporting
 him by his side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are right, it only reflects you.
 It's as if I am non-existent, indifferent.
 Like it doesn't recognize me.

\begin_layout Standard

I don't know if that's true but it, whatever it is, seems to be able to
 recognize, identify.
 Perhaps that's all it does, its chief function.
 Like a guard, or a gatekeeper.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich coughed somewhat hard, and flinched before spitting out a blob
 of bloodied sputum.
 To his amazement, he saw it reach the floor and then seep through it, like
 it was absorbed.
 A mere moment later, Hilderich's reflection appeared on the slab's surface,
 as if it had always been there and no one noticed.
 Amonas pointed and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How can that be? Suddenly it..
 Why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's gaze was locked were he had spat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

My blood.

 It knows me now as well.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I used the keystone.
 I pressed it, it went inside the stone half-way, and then just touched
 it and it was gone, like the stone had sucked it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It seems it did.
 You touched the stone, and then this place knew you.
 I certainly do not know how, and it does sound like magic or what people
 would call 'divine powers', but it must be some kind of elaborate ancient
 technology.
 I knew it wasn't just a myth, but I had never imagined it would still be
 around, certainly not in working condition.
 And not at this scale.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas glanced upwards frowning, and then spent a few moments surveying
 the darkness, the light, and the monolith before saying:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But where is this place? Where have we been for the last few days? If it
 is ancient technology, what is it doing here? Where is

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you really wish to know, Amonas? We could stay and find out.
 Investigate.
 It would be a singular chance in man's history.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's voice hinted at genuine passion and untold possibilities, real
 enthusiasm in his voice.
 Amonas looked him in the eyes sternly, dispassionately, almost coldly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 We are going back.
 You can stay if you want but you won't get far like that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded painfully with a grin and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was only thinking out loud.
 I want to go back.
 I have a job to do, didn't forget about that.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Well then, focus at going back.
 What now, Hilderich? Any ideas?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich spared a few moments of thought and then with some reluctance
 in his voice asked Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could you, touch it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

Nothing awful has happened so far, so I'd think that nothing awful will

 Of course, there's always the possibility something really awful happens
 in the end.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas touched the monolith without letting go of Hilderich and they vanished
 in an instant, their shapes horribly deformed and twisted right before
 a final flash of light made them disappear.
 Not an echo of them remained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\begin_layout Standard
They were comfortably seated in a white, non-nondescript couch, in what
 would more or less pass as a common room, with a small table, also white
 in color.
 The predominant color of their surroundings was, in fact, white, and all
 around them, a white wilderness seemed to stretch, and it was impossible
 to discern between sky or ceiling and the ground, since it all was white.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no visible source of light, but everything was softly lit, the
 white objects around them, like the couch and a small low table casting
 the faintest of shadows.
 The effect was, strangely enough, not disconcerting or disorienting.
 It all felt, quite normal to them, and actually soothing.
 A part of their minds was screeching in horror for it could not comprehend
 how they had ended up in this friendly but evidently inconceivable place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The better part of their minds though decided to just feel comfortable for
 a change, perhaps worry about such things and details later.
 Hilderich was feeling much better, being able to move his arms and torso
 without feeling pain.
 No bloody coughs either, no sunburns, no dehydration.
 He was actually feeling quite fit, fitter than ever.
 He felt he could run a hundred miles without breaking a sweat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas, who was sitting beside him, was similarly in the best of shapes,
 feeling well beyond normalcy.
 He turned around to look at Hilderich who was still checking their surroundings
 and making sure with his hands that his ribs were in place just as he felt
 they were.
 Amonas took notice of Hilderich's much improved state, and simply said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You look better.
 I look better.
 This place is, great.
 I have a nagging sensation though this is extremely strange.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I have that feeling too.
 I actually think I can hear my voice in my head screaming loudly in protestatio

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
A voice from nowhere interjected suddenly, vibrant and warm, but somewhat
 stilted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I should be fixing that.
 Strong residual harmonics in the transitional field transmogrification
 phase.
 The effect should diminish soon enough.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas reaction was immediate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Who is this? Show yourself! Where are we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich remained silent.
 The voice was heard once more:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The question is odd, but I am required to answer, indeed inclined to indulge
 your questioning nature.
 So, to answer in the same order: 'I' am part of a vast network of hyper-dimensi
onal computational self-aware matrices that effectively keep this whole
 world running.
 You could call me avatar, or thing, if you like, but that would not only
 make this conversation even less intelligent.
 I do not have anything to show to you as 'myself', since my genuine physical
 form is a hyper-dense cloud of matter in an amorphous plasma state.
 If I did, you could possibly distinguish a small prickle of light the size
 of a hairpin.
 I like to dispense with physical form whenever possible, I find it serves
 no purpose other than easing the fears of fairly primitive cerebral cortices
 like yours.
 And to answer your third question, you could be said to exist inside the
 buffer matrix of the conveyance sub-system of the Support.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked at Hilderich frowning intensely, as if he had understood almost
 nothing of what he had been told, and Hilderich was somehow able to make
 sense of everything.
 Hilderich returned him a wide-eyed look that brought down Amonas hopes
 crashing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see you are perplexed.
 More like dumbfounded, actually.
 I can explain somethings if you like, others I literally cannot.
 Some, will prove unfathomable to you even if I do explain in length.
 I believe we do have some time available until the next conveyance.

Hilderich looked upwards as if addressing God when he spoke next:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The next conveyance? Could that be that you are talking about the fiery

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Your choice of words is surprisingly pertinent, though very crude indeed.

 ballast vehicle.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich looked as if he wanted to learn everything at once, his face almost
 split from the effort of containing his thoughts and questions.
 He managed to ask once more, while Amonas walked around the small white
 space that surrounded them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So it is a vehicle? I had been right all along! Amonas, we're going home!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas turned and grinned, and was about to say something when the voice
 chimed in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, I happen to know the centron is devoid of human habitations, so I
 can safely conclude that you are mistaken.
 You will not be going home.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked at Hilderich with shock and indignation and then shouted,
 vaguely outward,at the unseen entity that had been talking to them for
 the past few minutes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We will not be prisoners no more! We demand to return to our home! You,
 with your ancient technology will certainly be able to accommodate such
 a want.
 We will pay in whatever acceptable currency you demand, if that is necessary.
 If you are in league with the Patriarch, we can buy back our lives.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The voice sounded as if it sniggered, and it then added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pay? Currency? Primitive indeed.
 You are not prisoners of any kind, you are merely being conveyed.
 All conveyance is to the centron, there is no other destination.
 If you will, it is a design limitation.
 It is not within my powers to alter that.
 You are going to the centron, that is why you entered the Pylon.
 Or maybe not.
 Well, you had the pass, so I had to comply.
 Really, you had no idea what you were doing, did you? Fascinating.
 Hasn't happened in a long time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich looked like he was suddenly drawn by something the voice had said.
 He asked with some degree of meticulousness, carefully, slowly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

By pass, you must mean the keystone.
 What happened to it?

Well, it is quite uncommon to walk around with a physical form of the pass.
 I understand it could be stolen, lost, even destroyed under certain circumstanc

 So, as is the usual case, I took the liberty of reintegrating it in your
 helix, your bodies, in a cellular level.
 Much more practical that way.

Amonas hands went to his heart and stomach instinctively, as he was indeed
 looking like he was searching for the keystone to jut out someplace.
 He shouted in anger:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

You put it inside us? What kind of devilry and sickness is this? Why not

Hilderich grabbed him by the arm and looked him in the eye, feeling his

 He said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Amonas, it's alright.
 I think.
 It's not there as a keystone.
 I think he means that it is now part of us.

 We are, a keystone each, I believe.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Amonas looked at Hilderich wide-eyed, in a further show of disbelief.
 He gasped but could not speak a word.
 The voice continued:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You really are from a primitive civilization.
 I rarely keep account of events on the outer shell but I was certain that

Hilderich asked then, his mind trying to focus on what he should ask next,
 the unknowns branching off each other like a mystic tree, the questions
 gnawing at him vying to be voiced first:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Right.

Both Hilderich and Amonas nodded, though Amonas face was slowly building
 up creases of anger and perhaps even wrath.

Well it's not real.
 It is an energy grid field-inducing construct.
 Think of it as a temporary room for your minds.
 All this is in your mind, for the sake of understanding.
 Your bodies are, right now, non-existent.
 You have been disintegrated into a complete series of information.
 You have been thoroughly, digitally and quantically, deconstructed, in
 order to be reconstructed, at the place of your destination, which is the

 The ballast vehicle will provide the actual transportation of the total

Hilderich was puzzled.
 Amonas was beyond puzzled and the total sum of unknown and impossible to
 believe or comprehend things had already overcome his tolerances.
 Instead of boiling in anger, he simply gave up and let Hilderich do the
 talking, since he seemed to understand some of what they were being told.
 He lied down on the couch, and closed his eyes, as if he was about to sleep.

The voice stopped, and suddenly the scenery around them became dark.
 Amonas was no longer lying down on a couch and he felt he was floating
 in mid-air, the darkness all consuming.
 He called out to Hilderich, but no answer came, then in an instant he saw
 a flashing bright well of swaths of light passing by him in horrific speeds.
 He could see no hands indeed he felt disembodied, unable to move.
 The well shot past him and now he was looking at little bright pin prickle
 of blue light, like a lonely star at night.
 Before he could see what it was.
 It came rushing at him, filling his entire field of vision, glistening
 on his every sense, a blue-white hot light engulfing him, as it was ready
 to devour him whole.
 He tried to shield himself, he felt like turning his back around and running.
 But he was more than unable.
 He had no body to flee with.

 Pilgrim aroused Molo from his fretful sleep with a nudge.
 Molo woke up with a gasp, his body tense, his face and palms sweaty.
 The Pilgrim thought his brother was troubled, as he had been for the last
 two nights.
 It was as if the spirits of the land and sky were not in his dreams, safekeepin
g him from the malevolence of the archenemy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would pray for his brother at dawn, perhaps something else was troubling
 him.
 Some lover, or wife.
 His children.
 He couldn't know yet, he wasn't learning his brother's tongue as fast as
 he could.
 But he had understood his pilgrimage was different.
 The had taken the same path, for the same reasons, but there were different
 customs to be obeyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, his brother was unlucky enough to have a wife and children that
 he had needed to leave behind.
 Perhaps a lover was awaiting his return.
 That might be the reason he suffered at night.
 He embraced his brothers arms reassuringly, and he nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He started walking again, towards the direction the walking stone pointed
 to.
 The night was chilly but dry, the desert a harsh, rocky field of red and
 brown, good enough for walking, but useless for everything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Very little was to be found in the way of a shelter, and water as scarce
 as snow flakes in the summer.
 And little more than burrowing furry creatures and small sand lizards in
 the way of eating.
 God provided, as ever, but his brother was uneasy with what they were able
 to gather.
 At first, he would not even taste the food, even when cooked on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When hunger took over him though, he mellowed, and grew wiser to the ways
 of God in his Holy place.
 Still, he seemed to be somewhat reserved in his adoration, somewhat aloof
 at times, his mind wandering at times.
 He could hear him sometimes speak in his native tongue, other times in
 the tongue of the Pilgrim's people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In his sleep, he talked as well.
 He could not make much, though he sometimes spoke of the Forge of Stones.
 He is young, I'll give him that, thought the Pilgrim.
 He has not yet had the time to fully embrace God in his true, purest, unblemish
ed form.
 Here, in his Holy Land, where he is most welcome, were his Truth sublimes
 us all, even the rock and sand.
 He would learn though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim saw in him a fervency, an ardor.
 He saw the determined glitter in his eyes, the way he looked at the Path,
 the awe when facing the suns setting over where His Gardens lay.
 He was worthy of the travel, and the peril.
 He was a brother sent from God, indeed.
 Though his brother's purpose was still to be revealed, the Pilgrim knew
 his own was renewed, that he would act as this man's mentor, tutor, as
 a wise and benevolent father, to fill his heart and mind with the joy that
 was God and Truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim's heart burned with vigor and his mind raced in these warm thoughts
 of God and His work and plan.
 He was so enthralled with what God had in stock for them both, that he
 had barely noticed his brother was not walking alongside him.
 He checked behind him, and he could not make out his figure in the blooming
 moonlight.
 He must have fallen asleep again, the Pilgrim thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he walked back, over the small sandy crest where they had curled and
 laid to sleep.
 He would be cold now that there was no god-stone to bring them light and
 heat and comfort.
 I should have been more thorough when I woke him, the Pilgrim thought,
 while he walked with a sure pace, slowly climbing to the top of the crest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There, he saw him sleeping, serenely this time.
 The Pilgrim momentarily thought he should leave him be for a little while
 longer, but the moon had been up for sometime now, and they had to take
 advantage of the night as best as they could.
 When the suns rose again in the morning, the heat and the cloudless sky
 would make traversing the desert an insufferable affair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They should be at the Dunes by morning, where the sea of sand could claim
 a man's life if he wasn't ready for its tribulations.
 God would provide, but man should be wary as ever.
 Many Pilgrims before him perished while traversing the Dunes, and left
 nothing but bleached bone as a warning to those that came after them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim shook Molo more violently this time, making sure he would wake
 up, stand on his feet and walk with him.
 It was for their own good, and the good of the Pilgrimage.
 It would not serve God if they tarried and indulged themselves.
 That was one of the lessons his brother had still to learn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo stirred and moaned a complain, something unintelligible even if the
 Pilgrim could understand his language.
 He rose from the ground wearily, languidly, and put a hand out as if letting
 the Pilgrim know he was really awake this time.
 He said in low Helican, the commoners tongue, signs of exasperation in
 his face, a disgruntled voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm up.
 I'm up, you heartless driver.
 Don't you get tired? Don't you need to sleep? I guess you're used to this
 sort of thing.
 When will we be getting there? Do you really know or are we wandering aimlessly
? You still don't understand a single word, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim smiled and made the hand gesture for 'God will provide', turned
 around and started walking, faintly motioning Molo to follow him with a
 flick of one wrist.
 Molo sighed wearily and started walking behind the Pilgrim, in a disheartened
 fashion, almost shuffling his feet, kicking up small clouds of fine dust
 in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim said something that Molo could not understand perfectly, something
 about the weary man finding consolation in God's plan, but he wasn't sure
 that was a proper translation.
 The man spoke High Helican, but it was somewhat mutated over the years
 probably, flex and intonation varied from the original.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it was the other way around, maybe the High Helican Molo had learned
 was the mutated form, but it mattered little since the only thing the man
 ever talked about was God, his plan, and this Pilgrimage he was on.
 That was alright, he didn't care if the Pilgrim was a half-mad ascetic
 fanatic, as long as he brought him to the Necropolis.
 Then, he would see what he might do with him.
 Perhaps he knew more than he let on from time to time about the place.
 He talked of gardens and a citadel, of a forge of some kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd stick around, as long as he proved useful for.
 If they ever got there, that was.
 They had been wandering farther into the desert for a couple of days now.
 The had left the marble road behind two nights before, and that was about
 the time when Molo had run out of food.
 Perhaps the man had saved their lives, with his uncanny ability to find
 food in such a forlorn and inhospitable place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though lizards and rats were not real food, it somehow became agreeable
 when one had not eaten in three days, and the smell of cooked meat wafted
 into his nostrils.
 Molo shuddered at the memory of Pilgrim cutting the lizard's head off,
 skinning it, and eating it raw, limb to limb.
 The man was a savage, that much was certain, but he somehow knew more about
 the Widelands than any man alive.
 The man had only identified himself as 'Pilgrim', but that much was enough
 for Molo to call him by when the need arose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were walking through a rocky desert, passing through low crests sometime,
 their direction unchanging.
 From what Molo could gather from where the suns rose and fell each day,
 they were walking roughly towards the northeast, and that seemed logical.
 The terrain had progressed from a rough savannah, into this rocky desert,
 and it seemed like soon they were about to enter the great sand dunes he
 had read about in Esphalon's accounts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And from then on he'd be almost lost.
 Esphalon had written down that once they entered the sand dunes, the pack
 mules they had brought with them died, choking to death in a sand storm
 they themselves barely escaped alive through sheer luck and perhaps, as
 Esphalon put it, providence.
 That was when they met the girl, that went on to lead them to the Necropolis
 per se, which they had failed to enter after fruitless labors of days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The girl was the one who sustained them through these perils, producing
 food and water out of what seemed to be thin air.
 That was not all though: The girl was quite insistent in preventing them
 in their efforts to enter the Necropolis proper, what Esphalon described
 as 'a gargantuan cluster of megalithic buildings that either shone or absorbed
 light, tightly packed together, as if they were wood on a basket, encircled
 by a wall that itself defied logic, in size, shape, and function'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had even used some kind of invisible force on them, on more than one
 occasion.
 She had began to weep and talk incessantly, begging them to halt their
 efforts, as she 'pushed us away from what could have been an entrance point
 to the dead city, what Master Umberth called a Necropolis.
 She did not seem to be angry or wrathful because of our attempts, but rather
 terrified, pleading with us to leave the place'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo hoped the Pilgrim would be much more helpful in that respect.
 After all, he had told him he had to enter the Holy Gardens, and pay his
 respects in the Citadel of God, reaffirm his people's faith in him, and
 be rewarded with the Forge of Stones.
 Those were the exact words he used, in perfectly proper High Helican.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Molo that sounded like the man was planning to enter what Umberth had
 dubbed the Necropolis of the Widelands.
 Indeed, he was not simply planning it, but was driven by a religious fervor
 Molo had not seen even in the Ministers of the Pantheon, or the most pious
 and faithful of lowly people that clung to such notions like a man about
 to drown clinging on a driftwood.
 This Pilgrim, was different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His faith drove him, inspired him, made him determined, unwavering.
 The contrast with the Ministers of the Pantheon was sharp: they instilled
 fear, caution, piety, obeisance, misery.
 A faithful man for Molo was a fool, a person reduced to a muttering idiot
 who felt the Gods were in his favor if his children were not taken away
 from him, and his crops were not dying of thirst or the cold of winter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moon was high above them now, the shadows it cast hard and short of
 stature, the only mark in the horizon the outlines of the small crests
 they had left behind.
 All around them the land was still, not even the sounds of scurrying desert
 rats, or the rush of the wind from a night gale.
 All he could hear was their feet on dirt and sand, and perhaps the sound
 of gravel on gravel, as they trod their feet over patches of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had noticed how much his boots were worn out by now.
 It was not the many miles he had traveled until he met the marble road
 that had made them so.
 It was the relatively few days he had been walking in the Widelands, that
 had made him feel he should've packed a pair of boots with him.
 The hot days and chilly nights had put some stress on the boot's leather
 skin, but t was the asperity of this place, this outer desert, the abrasive
 nature of the rocky ground, the mix of dust, sand, dirt and gravel that
 had made his boots little less than sheets of leather about to slit themselves
 open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remained a mystery to Molo how the Pilgrim seemed to be unperturbed by
 the roughness of the terrain, the adverse conditions, and the unforgiving
 miles he had walked to get here in he first place.
 As far as he knew, his people were nomads, living in the cold, harsh tundras
 of the north.
 It was understandable that he would be proficient in survival skills, but
 his ability to adapt to changes in climate and terrain must be one of a
 kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there were also the strange stones Molo had noticed the Pilgrim carries
 with him.
 They were small stones, but regularly shaped, as if they were cut by human
 hands, on purpose.
 They were dark green, with violet and cyan lights flashing in the morning
 suns, their surface smooth but with mysterious shapes looming right below,
 like patterns that kept moving each time you looked at one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the stones the Pilgrim uses as a guide, for getting his direction
 straightened out.
 Molo had noticed that every time the Pilgrim used it, always after offering
 praise to his God and praying, he slightly changed course, as if adjusting
 to what the stone showed him.
 Molo deduced that the stone points him somehow to the direction of the
 Necropolis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had briefly entertained the idea of killing the Pilgrim and getting the
 guiding stone off him, but had decided against that because he believed
 he would be much more useful to actually enter the Necropolis, rather than
 just reaching it.
 The other stone was much more interesting, Molo thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was what the Pilgrim used for shelter in this forsaken land, and probably
 something his people also used to stay alive in the harsh tundras of the
 north.
 The stone was a marvelous object: It offered them a small glowing light,
 enough to see each other's face, and it exuded warmth, but unlike a fire,
 the warmth did not seem to radiate from the stone.
 It felt as if they were enclosed in a bubble of sorts, where pleasant warmth
 occupied it, and the sounds and the wind outside were kept at bay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, as if they were suddenly put inside an invisible bubble of glass,
 protective and mindful of their basic comfort.
 From what he had seen, he believed that whatever the conditions outside,
 such a stone could keep them warm and dry, exactly what a human body would
 need to stay alive in any climate.
 Molo thought of the stone as a fantastic artifact of mysterious origins
 and unheard of qualities, in the hands of a savage that could barely use
 a wheel, if in fact he had ever seen one in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Molo felt there was probably so much more he could learn from the Pilgrim.
 So many mysteries that could be unraveled just because the Pilgrim knew
 these things, like he had always known them.
 As if it were rote, custom, and legend that was passed on from generation
 to generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo thought more about how the Pilgrim had introduced himself at first,
 and remembered that he had referred to himself as 'a' Pilgrim.
 Which meant that there were others.
 Or had been others in the past.
 He had not broached the subject because when he did ask the Pilgrim about
 things, even about relatively simple things like what will they eat or
 when will they stop for a break, the answers he received from the Pilgrim
 were nothing short of enigmatic, or occluded by religious reverence and
 pious deference to God and his plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo thought that asking him about his Pilgrimage would make the man erupt
 in a series of prayers and gestures, long recitals of stories and tradition
 as well as many other minutiae that would only complicate his efforts at
 understanding whatever useful information and knowledge this Pilgrim could
 offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He believed that it was best he gathered what the Pilgrim would share without
 knowing, and infer knowledge from that alone.
 When the time came, perhaps he could press him for more, or outright do
 away with him.
 He did not think the Pilgrim could be extorted with fear or driven to betray
 his beliefs, especially know that he was on a holy mission, a Pilgrimage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if his life was forfeit, he would rather think himself as a martyr,
 a holy failure.
 In that regard, Molo had to endure his presence, and learn as much from
 him as possible through what little interaction they had.
 Truthfully, Molo did not think he would have been able to survive the tribulati
ons of the desert had it not been for the Pilgrim and his stones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He grinned when he thought that how ironic it would be that in the end,
 it was most likely that the man he had saved, would take away his life.
 When he did so, the Pilgrim had turned around to check up on how far behind
 he was, noticed the grin, and smiled with puzzlement and naivety.
 Molo took the chance to build more of a rapprochement with the Pilgrim,
 something he could use later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He remembered that according to Esphalon, the moonlit nights were held as
 having special significance to his people, for some reason he had not stayed
 long enough to decipher and understand.
 He had noted down how they paid homage though, which was by turning to
 face the moon, kneel down with folded arms and kiss the ground.
 That last part made Molo uneasy for a moment, but he proceeded to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he rose again, he saw the Pilgrim was wearing a sad expression on his
 face, as if he was sorrowful all the while.
 That made Molo try to copy his mood, as if such was the appropriate thing
 to do.
 He suddenly looked sullen and respectful, just like the Pilgrim.
 He noticed then that the Pilgrim simply told him a single word: 'apalgos'.
 He then bowed his head and made the sign of God, and resumed his walk as
 normal as ever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo had not known that word, never saw it in scripts or texts, and seemed
 to have no other common root or sound like something he could understand.
 It was as if the word was new, or his vocabulary incomplete.
 It baffled him, and made a mental note to himself to perhaps ask the man
 to describe it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had seen how the Pilgrim had reacted when he had by error used the word
 'Gods' instead of 'God', and he had known the man was dangerously fanatical.
 It would not serve him well to have to kill him if he found out he was
 not a fellow believer as the Pilgrim believed.
 He used the word 'our' when referring to God, as well as 'brother' and
 'believer' when referring to Molo.
 Molo had never thought that learning High Helican would ever be of such
 a use in his life's quest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim felt he understood his brother better now.
 Everything made much more sense, if the man was on a journey of sorrow.
 It was only natural if he was grieving that he'd be troubled in his sleep,
 aloof sometimes, disenchanted and forgetful in his devotions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a way, the Pilgrim thought, it was even harder on him, having lost a
 loved one on such a day, to walk through the Land of God, with its many
 trials, and hidden dangers of the mind and soul.
 It was indeed a mixed sign for the Pilgrim: a grieving man on the Land
 of God that needed guidance and help to make it through alive and be free
 of his sorrow, along with a Pilgrim that needed something to focus lest
 he stray from the path of Truth, and fail his people and his God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had not heard of such a Pilgrimage before.
 He felt like the moonlight shone upon him with the brightness of his God's
 light.
 He felt inundated with honor and love.
 He felt wary of such sudden rushes of strong feelings, and breathed slowly,
 carefully rearranging his thoughts and feeling to protect him from the
 sins of pride and arrogance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was in God's hand alone the manner in which his Pilgrimage would take
 place, and that was all that he needed to know.
 It did not mean he was special.
 It meant that he carried a special burden, and had a special purpose in
 life.
 Himself, he was but a man of God, as was his brother.
 They both had their reasons to walk this path.
 He felt reassured now, and he troubled his mind with such no more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked in silence from then on, until their legs were sore and their
 throats dry.
 In the middle of the night, with nothing but the moon light and the stars
 to shine upon their eyes and let them find their way, reveling in a divine
 solitude, the Pilgrim stopped walking, and gestured for Molo to do the
 same, with a repetitive downward motion of his hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He did not like to use the words of God in His Holy Land in vain, or for
 mundane things such as simple communication.
 He found the hand gestures and nods to be enough, and his brother understood
 most of the time.
 He was also mindful of using the Holy Tongue, and only did so after he
 had done so himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes he spoke in this other tongue of his, a somewhat crude, harsh
 tongue, that seemed to resemble the Holy Tongue somewhat, but was very
 far from it.
 Maybe it was a way to speak a form of his tongue without speaking the Holy
 Tongue vainly.
 Maybe their tribe was older, and their customs still clung to the time
 before the Purge, whereas they, the God's chosen children, had been instructed
 in different ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a miracle indeed to find another believer, another man of God, whose
 people had survived the Purge, so far away.
 The wise men had always said that God works in mysterious ways, and lo
 and behold, a brother long lost is found wandering in God's Holy Land.
 The Pilgrim thought to himself that if that was not an act of God, then
 all this was nothing but a fantasy woven in his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was real, as real as his purpose, as real as the True Path, as real
 as anything he had believed in since he was born.
 He was sitting down, legs woven together, when all those feeling of certainty
 and faith, the warm knowledge of God's plan working so delicately through
 him, left him with a smile on his face, tears welling in his eyes.
 He held those tears, feeling he would be misjudged by his brother, and
 that would only serve further to his befuddlement, whereas he should be
 enlightening him by action alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim offered Molo his leather flask, filled with water they had gathered
 from a meaty, barbed plant, its juices nothing more than water.
 Soon though it seemed to Molo, they would be entering the real no man's
 land, where nothing ever grew, and the only change was the shifting of
 the dunes, slaved to the whims of the wind.
 Molo accepted the flask with a nod, sipped cautiously and dived in a sea
 of thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Esphalon's tales of this part of the Widelands, the inner desert were sparse,
 and yielded little information.
 They were mainly concerned about the lack of water and the sandstorm that
 had almost killed them and denied them of most of their supplies and all
 their animals.
 It was a race for survival, and the telling of Esphalon focused more on
 how their lives were coming to an end day by day, rather than anything
 really useful about their survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the girl that had actually saved them, if that indeed was fact and
 not mere fiction or the wild imaginings of a man brought to the brink of
 death.
 In any case, he would have to trust the Pilgrim on their survival.
 Unfortunately, he had not seen yet the Pilgrim use a stone that would produce
 food or water like the girl in Esphalon's account presumably did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had no idea how they would make it further into the desert, closer to
 the Necropolis.
 But he strongly believed that the Pilgrim was somehow prepared for the
 ordeal, much better than he could ever be.
 It was ironic, Molo thought, that a man that bears a grudging disbelief
 against all sorts of divine creatures and indeed faith itself, has such
 a strong belief in a man wholly devoted to a fantastic person, a lingering
 myth from an older civilization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was very opportune that at that specific moment, the Pilgrim rose again
 and asked for his flask.
 Molo drank once more, a greedy gulp running down his throat, refreshing
 and invigorating, exactly what he needed for the rest of the walk.
 They seemed to have a few hours until the sun rose, and from their brief
 period of rest Molo assumed the Pilgrim was not planning on making any
 other stops.
 That was just as good, since the more they walked through this landscape,
 the less time they would have to spend in this treacherous desert, and
 the sooner they would arrive at their destination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They started off once more, and trudged onwards, Molo right behind the Pilgrim.
 They were silent again as ever, and after a couple of hours weariness and
 boredom overcame Molo.
 His pace lessened and soon the distance between him and the Pilgrim began
 to grow.
 The Pilgrim took notice at some point, paused, and urged him onwards with
 motions from his arms and nods from his head.
 He pointed at the moon that had started to sink lower and lower.
 It meant that dawn was near, and they'd soon stop, rest and sleep.
 Molo gathered what little of his stamina remained, and with painful effort
 picked up his pace for one last time that day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon, the colors of dawn were starting to paint the sky.
 In a matter of minutes, the suns would make their bright entrance and wash
 away the night.
 The Pilgrim stopped then, and beckoned Molo to come sit right next to him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were atop a rather wide crested hill of rock and dirt, with coarse
 sand covering its very ridge.
 Molo indulged the Pilgrim and as he climbed the last few feet, he saw the
 sand dunes before him, eating away at the horizon, the crests of the dunes
 like waves of sand, their ever-changing nature imperceptible to the naked
 eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A thin line of blood red, sun yellow and sea blue hung between the sky and
 the desert.
 It was the break of dawn, and the Pilgrim seemed to marvel at the sight,
 which Molo could not help thinking was indeed a sight to leave a man speechless.
 The Pilgrim made his morning prayers, and Molo followed suit, as had been
 the case since they met on the marble road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, he started looking around him as if searching for something that he
 had dropped.
 He moved over to a patch of sand a few steps away, and with deliberate
 movements of his hands, he began digging into the sand with his bare hands.
 Molo frowned in puzzlement at this weird behavior, which topped everything
 the man had done so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was even more surprised, when the man briefly paused digging, turned
 around and nodded to Molo for help.
 Molo could not even imagine the purpose of the Pilgrim's toils and he thought
 this entire scene to be acutely comical and would have made him laugh profoundl
y if he had not been part of it.
 He acquiesced though, and soon enough found himself to be digging right
 beside the Pilgrim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within a few moments, he felt the sand damp under his palms.
 Perhaps, there was reason in this, and the reason was water.
 Soon enough, a grinned formed in his face, while the Pilgrim remained apathetic
, almost indifferent.
 They had dug out a small hole in the sand, where there was enough water
 to fill their flasks, and perhaps drink a handful each.
 It was downright astonishing that the man simply peered through the sand
 and found a spot where water was only two feet underneath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could have never guessed such a thing for the life of him.
 The Pilgrim was proving his value to Molo with each passing day, and he
 couldn't help but feel genuine respect for the man, even though he suspected
 there had to be some aid from the stone, albeit he had not seen him use
 one right then and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When their flasks where filled and they had some water to drink, the Pilgrim
 motioned for Molo to sit in a somewhat flat space of sand.
 As he did so, he brought out his shelter stone, and set it down roughly
 between them.
 He made the sign of god, and laid down, with his back to Molo.
 Soon enough, the air felt pleasantly warm.
 The suns came up, two blinding spots of light walking hand in hand, rising
 across a violet-blue colored sky.
 Pretty soon, daylight became too bright for the naked eye to handle, but
 where the stone lay, it was pleasantly dusky, and one could actually close
 his eyes and fall asleep.
 Molo noticed the Pilgrim had already done that, the outline of his rising
 and falling ribs following the rhythm of his breathing, slow, deep, and
 steady.
 Molo thought to himself he might actually leave the man be, when the time
 came.
 'After all, what harm could he do when the secrets of the Necropolis will
 be laid bare to me', Molo thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace medskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had slept away most the day.
 When Molo woke up, it was to the recently-made familiar smell of cooked
 reptile meat.
 The Pilgrim was handling the roasting of the meat on his knife expertly.
 Curiously, Molo noticed for the first time it was a knife with a strangely
 fashioned two-edged blade: one was serrated and the other seemed to be
 razor sharp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The knife seemed to be made of steel or a similar metal, perhaps even silver,
 but that could not explain how it had been able to weather time without
 being reduced to little more than a useless piece of metal.
 And it seemed certainly implausible that a tribe of nomads on the brink
 of savagery could have fashioned a finely crafted blade without expert
 knowledge, foundries, forges and artisans capable of supreme craftsmanship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He concluded in his mind that the knife must be a thing of a long forgotten
 past, a treasured relic handed down from one generation to the next, indeed
 crafted by a civilization like the one that had erected the Necropolis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was fascinating to witness an ancient relic wielded like a common utensil,
 nothing more than a tool, when it's value to knowledge and the unlocking
 of hitherto unexplainable mysteries was incalculable.
 Molo realized he had been staring at the knife for too long, his sight
 out of focus, as if he was still drowsy from sleep, as if his mind raced
 to meet the dreamworld it had unjustly been forced to escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim jogged him back into reality with a slap on the shoulder that
 he must have considered an expression of brotherhood and amicability towards
 him.
 Molo noticed he was also offering him the knife with the piece of unknown
 meat on it, charred somewhat on the edges and slightly curled, as if it
 had been roasted on the fire for too long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo thought about inquiring about the origin of the meat, but quickly his
 inquisitiveness dissipated into a forlorn hope that some of the desert
 was populated by hares or something equally less hideous than lizards.
 The smile on the Pilgrim's face assured him of how wildly imaginative he
 had become concerning food during the past few days, and grudgingly decided
 to feed on whatever the Pilgrim had caught.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reality, he thought it was quite important to never know what it was
 that the Pilgrim had offered him, especially since it tasted much better
 than the previous things he had been forced to taste by necessity.
 The thought of actually beginning to enjoy desert-hunted reptilian wildlife
 made his shiver with disgust at himself for even thinking of abasing himself
 in such a barbaric way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Momentarily, the memory of some exquisite sauté veal liver assaulted his
 senses, and he could almost smell its fine taste and texture against his
 palate.
 He felt certain he could kill a man for a glass of Fironian dry white.
 But all that was just tricks of the mind.
 He knew he was eating something that was meant to crawl and slither instead
 of walk, fly, or swim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The illusion though, when maintained in his mind, was a shelter for his
 mind.
 A way for him to ignore the nuances of survival, and proceed to complete
 his aim, and purpose.
 And on that day, he knew he was so much closer.
 The sand dunes beckoned before them, and it would take much more than the
 mere lack of luxury to prevent him from the most worthwhile of goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once his hunger was satisfied, he took a swig of water from his own flask
 and rolled it around his mouth in an effort to wash down the uncannily
 chicken-like meat.
 Then, noticing that the eyes of the Pilgrim were lost in the sea of sand,
 he sat for awhile idly gazing at the dunes, trying to make out anything
 worth noticing in the amorphous dune crests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt that they should be moving on right away, but the usually relentless
 Pilgrim had quietened down and was sitting still and cross-legged on the
 warm sand, the shelter stone nowhere in sight.
 To Molo, it looked as if he was basking in the light of the suns, like
 the lizard he must have deftly caught with nothing but his knife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was serene, his face almost glowing from within.
 It was like looking at a man who thought his existence was made just and
 fair by virtue of his devotion to his God, his Truth, his Path.
 Molo felt like the man was actually basking in a swath of divine light,
 his God's gift, a warm and bright light that could fill a man's soul to
 the brim, and yet could not possibly be spilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo thought those were very strange feelings, and he could not understand
 how they had suddenly appeared unbidden.
 He felt a strange kind of sympathy for the Pilgrim, one he could not put
 down in all detail.
 Something evaded him, and though such feelings were not totally unknown
 to Molo, he had spent a great deal of his life hurtling them aside, uncovering
 the truth underneath such deceit of the heart and soul, and ascribing the
 true logic behind such manifestations of the human psyche.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, he was struggling to accept the fact that he had no easy answers,
 indeed no answers at all.
 The Pilgrim was a mystery that defied Molo's reason, since he was unable
 to fathom why this man exuded this air of spirituality, of homeliness,
 of trust.
 These were feelings that Molo had years ago cast aside and attributed to
 man's various futile efforts at making sense of the world and his existence,
 making up emotions in the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here he lay, a savage man with no ties to such trappings of the civilized
 man, a pilgrim that somehow managed to cripple his mind with nothing but
 a smile and a prayer.
 Perhaps, Molo thought, these are side-effects of malnourishment and dehydration
, a prelude to hallucination.
 Perhaps, there is something very strange about this Pilgrim.
 Or, he admitted reluctantly in his mind, he might have been wrong in some
 of his assertions about various things he had vowed never to revisit again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim's pull on his shoulder brought him to world of the senses once
 more.
 He could see the falling suns, their glare losing its strength as they
 slowly glided past the sea of sand into a thin velvet horizon of scarlet
 and violet blue.
 His nostrils were assaulted by the grains of sand that were starting to
 float wildly in the air, and he felt his mouth filled with the salt of
 the earth under his feet.
 He looked towards the northeast where their path would take them and all
 he could see was the ashen gray and dull brown-yellow of what he judged
 to be a cloud made of sand.
 And it they were going to walk right through it, if his sight was as clear
 as his mind at that moment.
 The notion rang a deep bell of life-threatening danger that superseded
 every other thought, feeling and intention.
 The writings of Esphalon came to his mind, where he had written down about
 the sandstorm that almost killed them and left them hapless to roam the
 desert in vain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'..clouds the size of mountains no man had never even imagined toppled the
 reign of the suns and cast them down into the night side of the world.
 The air was suddenly thick with dirt and cold as a dead man's touch, heavy
 with the sand and stone of the desert sea.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We made haste to what seemed like a rocky alcove in the distance, barely
 visible under the cusps of sand that harrowed the very air we draw breath
 from.
 The mules would not budge, no matter how much we pulled and pushed them.
 As the wind grew more intense, and sand began to hurt our very skin, we
 had to abandon them to their fate, mindful to take as much water and food
 as haste allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We hid under that alcove, while a maddened storm raged just beyond the reach
 of our palms.
 A couple of feet separated us from the unwavering madness of this uncaring
 place that assaulted any form of life with the same deliberate indignation.
 For hours on end, all our senses were of no use, except from ears.
 The howling sounds of the sandstorm ruled supreme, whipping the very earth,
 tormenting the sky, challenging the moon for the reign of night eternal
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When exactly the storm had died down, we knew not.
 All we could see was the moonlight shining upon the desert once more, as
 if nothing of import had occurred.
 It mattered not that the clean-picked bones of our mules told otherwise.
 That was the Widelands, and life had no place there.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words of Esphalon coiled in his mind like a snake, ready to leap out
 from his mouth.
 He saw the Pilgrim was already putting some distance between them.
 He called out to him in High Helican so he could understand him without
 needs for further explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim then turned around and looked at Molo as if he had uttered a
 nonsensical statement.
 Briefly, Molo thought he had mispronounced what he had meant to say, and
 his words carried no meaning to the Pilgrim.
 A moment passed though, and the Pilgrim stroked his beard and nodded knowingly.
 He gestured for Molo to hurry up and come closer, fill the distance, while
 he set out again.
 Perhaps he had an explanation, or had already seen a place that could shield
 them from the approaching clouds that could grind anything alive down to
 the bone.
 When Molo caught up with the Pilgrim a few moments later, he grabbed him
 by the arm and forced him to stop, asking him in High Helican:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What will we do about the storm?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which the Pilgrim replied with a gaze to the sky and the sign of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was now losing his temper.
 This man must be mad, he thought.
 His mind raced with the possibility that this man was indeed mad from the
 beginning and had somehow made a journey of thousand of miles only to offer
 himself as sacrifice or something equally idiotic like killing himself
 because he had sinned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But no, that was not the case, Molo decided.
 He looked at his calm, serene face as he turned to face the sky and praise
 his God solemnly, and knew that he had a solution, he had an answer to
 this enigma.
 He was certain of it, and his determination proved it somehow.
 There was nothing to be afraid, everything is accounted for.
 It will be alright, no reason to worry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These were the words that streamed through Molo's mind, and it felt as if
 the Pilgrim was the source, the reason for these thoughts.
 He seemed now to Molo like an unyielding, irresistible beacon of hope,
 unmoving as mountain, stable as rock, a haven for any troubled soul.
 His gaze was not hard as it was before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He relaxed his grip on the arm of the Pilgrim, and his jaw slackened.
 The dust was beginning to swirl around them, the sand getting in their
 mouths, trying to bore through their skin.
 It was a very strange feeling for Molo, surrendering himself, body and
 mind, to an illogical notion.
 He stood there, transfixed, the Pilgrim knelt down before him, facing the
 approaching sandstorm head on, while all around them the makings of a whirlwind
 abounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo had mysteriously let go of his prohibitions, of his logical and analytical
 mind, of his reasoning and his fears, and just trusted the Pilgrim.
 It was all a matter of trust, here in the Widelands, as far as he could
 tell.
 And he had decided to trust the man, with his life, and ultimately his
 purpose in life as well.
 Which of the two he valued most, he sincerely could not tell by now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim had knelt down, seeing his brother was filled with fear, worry,
 doubt.
 It would be no different to God, for if he had deemed that he should live,
 he would live, and his brother with him.
 If he had deemed that he should die, and they should perish, and that would
 be the end of their lives, for better or for worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But to appease his brother, and make him ready for the coming trial, the
 trial of their souls, he would pray.
 He would pray loudly, fervently, with ardor and passion.
 He would sing praise to God, with all the power his lungs could afford,
 and he would ask for forgiveness for their sins, known and unknown, willing
 and unwilling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would ask of his God to deliver them, but he would also offer his life
 and soul as a last service, of his own volition, if so God wished of him.
 He would speak on behalf of his brother, and plead for his salvation, body
 and soul, because he was a grieving man, born of pain and want, not a sinner
 whose mind was set, neither a blasphemer who thought himself beyond the
 reach of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would pray, until the storm had passed and their God had decreed their
 souls clean, unyielding, fit for a human being.
 And his brother would pray with him.
 He turned around and saw his brother was also kneeling down, his eyes closed,
 his hands buried in the sand.
 The sky was now bleak, the front of the sand storm coming to greet them
 head on, the suns almost drowned in its dark gray wave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned around then, and touched his brother's arms, who was already doing
 as he should.
 He shuddered slightly at his touch, and then started crying, in fervor
 or in fear, the Pilgrim could not honestly tell.
 And then he started chanting, his clear voice challenging the howls of
 the rising wind, cutting a clean path through the hurtling sands towards
 the heart of the storm.
 And the wind grew louder and stronger, and the sands started to tear at
 their skin, lashing them like razor sharp tufts of steel grass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, while the voice of the Pilgrim went on unwavering, seeking God,
 asking him to reach down from where he dwelt and lift them from their fatal
 fate, the suns could be seen in their last streak of light, for once more
 hiding until the morning came, leaving behind them a lukewarm trace of
 violet, stars already visible on the edges between sky and earth.
 And the storm had cleared, dissolved, like God had simply wished it away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wind fell into a light breeze, and the sands quietened down, and became
 still as the night that had just arrived.
 The Pilgrim made the sign of God, and stood upwards, gesturing for Molo
 to follow him.
 He even offered him his hands, which he rarely did, as he thought it was
 unbecoming of a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His brother was still on his knees, and had just opened his eyes.
 Without warning, he saw tears running down on his cheeks, the look of a
 man who was blind and could now see again on his face.
 His brother made the sign of God, this time somehow different than before.
 It was quite possible, the Pilgrim thought, that his brother was beginning
 to learn how to love God properly, like any man should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pulled him up by his hands and they both walked away into the night.
 Now that the trial of the storm had passed, they should be able to see
 the Gates by tomorrow night, when the moon would be empty once more, and
 nothing but starlight would shine upon the sacred walls.
 He briefly considered telling him, but he thought he already knew.
 Why else, the Pilgrim asked himself, would he be carrying no guiding stone?
 It was because he knew.
 Because God had sent him.

 were banging at the door, he could hear them getting ready to bring it
 down.
 There was not much he could do, other than take the flight of stairs to
 the upper floor, and then try and jump over to the inn from across the
 balcony.
 He could die by the sword, or with his neck snapped in half and his head
 smashed onto the cobbled street.
 He might make it though, and keep running.
 Any chance was better than certain death at their hands though, so the
 decision was quick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as soon as they barged in, with swords drawn at the ready, he glimpsed
 at them as he ran up the stairs, their frenzied faces bearing witnesses
 to their folly and madness.
 He thought he knew one of them, from the time before he had joined the
 army.
 His feet raced in pace with his mind, though in quite different directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could hear their steps heavy on the wooden stairs, its planks creaking
 from the weight and the sudden rush of bodies upon it.
 He was trying to remember his name, while he saw a shaft of light falling
 down on him, for a moment blinding him causing him to squint.
 His hands barely touching the rails of the stairs guided him onwards, his
 steps unfaltering, haste in every movement, like a fleeing hare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, it was Theodorus Fellman, the stabler's boy who worked with him as
 apprentices to the brewer.
 The shaft of light was coming from the attic's window, a place he seldom
 visited and duly avoided when he could.
 His feet kicked up dust that had settled in during many years, after long
 winters and hot summers had passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their voices grumbled with vulgar words and curses, demanding his blood.
 Sinner, he heard them call him, blasphemer and the like.
 Things he had not thought of himself.
 Theodorus, he remembered, was not very good as a brewer, always botching
 the brew, drinking mostly when the master left them to cater the shop on
 their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had kicked him out after a couple of weeks, and Theodorus had cursed
 him.
 Now he was back, hunting him down, a dog of war, unleashed upon meek prey
 such as himself.
 As he thought that, his one foot was already on the foot of the window,
 hands outside, ready to take the leap.
 He turned around waiting to see teeth upon his flesh, hear the howls of
 the pack vying for blood, his blood to be spilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that moment, he only saw Theodorus mad with blood lust, and as his blade
 tore through his torso, he thought he saw a sad moment of realization,
 a sparkle of recognition in the eyes of his killer.
 As he fell to the ground, his eyes looked up to the clear sky and the wonderful
 day the dawned had promised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When his body met the ground with a clatter like broken clay, he saw no
 more, and his blood ran down the cobbled street like red wine from a dripping
 keg, a waste many would find regrettable but only few would weep for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The smell of blood, like iron, barely covered the stench of the bodies.
 But that was only because the slaughter had just begun.

General Tyrpledge was riding his horse, making an inspection of the City
 walls from a safe distance, his personal guard along with his adjutant
 following him from a respectful but close distance.
 He still could not believe he was tasked with the sacking of Pyr, and if
 it came to that, its razing.
 The Castigator had been blunt in orders and frugal in his explanations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had told him that the Patriarch was in league with a cluster of rebellious
 religious fanatics that wished for total domination of the Patriarch over
 the ruling council.
 He also said the Patriarch had made the first move against peace and prosperity
, and we would bear witness to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, a messenger arrived bearing a message from the Patriarch, that the
 Castigator had been deemed unworthy in the eyes of God, and that the Noble
 Representative, Lord Ursempyre Remis, was the new Castigator of the Outer
 Territories.
 The General was dumbstruck, utterly flabbergasted at the turn of events,
 and did not know how to react.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator talked to him in earnest, urging him to uphold the Law, honor
 his rank and office, protect him and the Council as a whole, crush the
 rebels before they could take root firmly.
 He had asked about the Arch-minister, who had seemed a reasonable enough
 man, to intervene, somehow mediate, so that balance could be restored and
 things would not deteriorate into profuse madness at the speed of a rushing
 waterfall, as it seemed to be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator had informed him then that sadly, the Arch-minister was found
 dead, assassinated by the rebel scum, the henchmen of the unholy demon
 that had posed as their Patriarch.
 Most of his staff were also cruelly killed, their skin flayed out to the
 bone, while the Arch-minister himself seemed to have been made the object
 of a ritual to the Deceiver, the False God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator, with tears in his eyes had insisted that there was no better
 way to avenge his memory, other than to bring those heathen scum that had
 infiltrated their society to their knees, grind them into oblivion and
 spread their ashes in the oceans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect on the General was devastating; in one night, everything that
 he had been taught, everything that he had built his life upon was crumbling
 down around him, around them all.
 The Patriarch, in league with rebels? Absurd! The very word had fallen
 into disuse, and was used only in an historical context, of ages past,
 or in thought-provoking discussion that rarely allowed its participants
 to delve deeper into such subjects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of rebellion was indeed, taboo.
 It had been since he had learned how to read and write.
 He thought to himself with bitterness that he might have been spared such
 skills, but then again, how would the army live and breathe without notices,
 requisition forms, and orders in triplicate?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Castigator, fleeing into the night, beset on all sides by danger
 and hounds set out for his blood? All under the design of the Patriarch,
 with the Noble Representative aiding him? Himself, the most noble of the
 Lords, ruler of a family of great tradition and honor, an arch-demon in
 the flesh, thousands of men acting his bidding like minions? Incredulous,
 inconceivable, unimaginable, the General had thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until he had seen the orders written and signed from the Patriarch, have
 his army stand down, ignore the Castigator before him as a traitor and
 conspirator set to overthrow the Rule of the Council, disarm the men and
 dissolve the Army peacefully, under the watchful eye of the procrastinators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The letter was signed and sealed by the Castigator of the Outer Territories,
 Ursempyre Remis, the acting Arch-minister, and that buffoon, the Procrastinator
 Militant, Gomermont.
 That was enough to bitterly set his mind, and order the immediate assembly
 of all fighting units.
 Once General Tyrpledge reaffirmed his army's oaths to the Castigator, he
 ordered that the army march toward the City of Pyr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They marched in a campaign to uphold the Law, and free their land and people
 from the tyranny of evil men.
 Men whose sinister purposes knew no bounds and would stop at nothing other
 than the utter desecration of the Gods, the dissolution of the Law, and
 the destruction of their divinely crafted society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As these announcements were made in front of the whole army, the few procrastina

 sent, fled with alacrity in an unusual sign of intelligence.

\begin_layout Standard
And so it had began, the campaign that would forever change the history
 of the Outer Territories for better, or for worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General had been musing on these recent past events for some time, it
 seemed, because he could hear anxiety and worry in the words that his adjutant
 repeated in the same staccato manner:

Guighan, this is not a parade ground.
 This is war.

 It's because of this stupid war.
 However, one must choose a side.
 And I chose what I've believed in all my life.

You must be an expert in terseness, Guighan.
 Let's continue the inspection.
 I need to find a weak spot or something we could use to our advantage.
 If possible, I would like to keep bloodshed to a minimum.
 The insurgents could be hiding anywhere, posing as innocents, sheltered
 by anonymity.
 Unless they put a jester's hat on with bell's and whistles, our soldiers
 will be unable to differentiate between the enemy and the common folk.
 Though the distinction by the time all this is over could become a lesson
 in semantics.
 Carry on, major.

Major Guighan saluted briskly and rejoined the guard further back, where
 he relayed the order to continue.
 With that, they set off, the horses slowly trotting, and the foot-soldiers
 keeping a brisk pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, the insurgents seemed ready to hold their ground, and
 the walls looked well defended, with no exceptionally weak points in sight.
 No significant breach had been made from the first shots of the siege engines,
 and the rest of them had barely began to be assembled at this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once these were completed, and a point of entry selected, they would fire
 a barrage concentrated on a specific point in the walls, hoping to tear
 it down and gain entry.
 His cavalry had made attempts at reconnoitering but had not succeeded in
 gaining much other than some fatal injuries and lots of worn out horses.
 It seemed that these men defending the walls would not be caught napping
 so easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General from this distance could see the milling masses of men, assembling
 to receive their orders for the day, cleaning their swords and tending
 to their armor and shields.
 He could see the pike-men polishing their halberds in an almost ceremonious
 fashion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bowmen were stretching the chords of their bows, testing its tension
 limits, filling their quivers with arrows.
 The swordsmen were up and about, ready to be called for action, their longwords
 a mirror sheen, their chain-mails and helmets gray dull steel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General was generally pleased with what he was seeing, the men following
 orders, adhering to protocol, going about their business as usual.
 As if this was one of many exercises, as if they were not marching against
 their own people.
 A rarity in his career, the General did not know what to make of that?
 Did his men care not at all? Or was their sense of duty overshadowing their
 other emotions? That remained to be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The outlook of his army, he deemed, was a professional, determined force
 ready for action.
 But some of the units though required special attention, because of their
 special nature, and special abilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The men of the vaunted Thorax regiment were still trying to put on their
 monstrously over-sized armor, huge burly men, encased thick sheets of plate
 metal, almost impervious to arms, even against steel rifles.
 They would form the front line of the assault, to cover and shield the
 men behind them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And far behind at their maximum range distance, while all the rest of the
 army was preparing for battle, the crews of the steamers were making sure
 their machines would be ready when called upon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything seemed as it should be, everyone seemed professional, going about
 his work.
 It somehow felt wrong for an army to be this distant, so indifferent to
 an enemy that was in fact their own people, though wildly misled and utterly
 wrong in their decision to upset the way of life.
 Or so Tyrpledge felt.
 He didn't know, and could not know, though what his men thought and felt.
 He'd have to wait for them to show their true demeanor and spirit in the
 ultimate test: In battle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When battle was joined, the true feeling of his men would emerge.
 Beyond wrath and blood lust, beyond the will to survive and in doing so
 kill a man, would they show remorse? Guilt? Would they stay their hands
 in a moment of doubt? When they see their brother coming at them with ax
 and sword, will they judge him wrong or will the animal inside have the
 final word.
 When all this is said and done, will there be victory? Or nothing but loss?
 It would be for the Gods to decide.
 Him, as General of the Army of the Outer Territories, would follow his
 own path to the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His look was now veritably sullen, withdrawn.
 He had reined his horse to stop its trot.
 He was not even looking at the walls now, or his men, or any of the machines.
 He was looking at his own hands, gloves taken off, fearing that somehow
 blood had already soiled them.
 The blood of his own people.
 But their lives were forfeit now, he knew.
 The moment they decided to carry out every unholy blasphemous act ever
 imagined.
 And perhaps some that were never.
 What would they hope to gain, other than seed war, bloodletting, misery,
 hate? He could not fathom.
 And he could never remit their folly now.
 They may have dug their own graves, but it saddened him very much now the
 thought that he would have to fill them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked up again, squinting slightly at the bright light of the suns.
 He noticed from the corner of his eye Major Guighan approaching almost
 sheepishly, a trait that usually provoked his anger and irritation, even
 though he did not consider himself an irascible man.
 It was probably because he did expect men around him to perform their duties
 to the best of their abilities.
 Major Guighan was his adjutant, so he was supposed to stay close to him,
 advise him, confide in him.
 How could he do that from all that distance? He was an exceptional logistics
 officer, very capable at handling personnel and men via manifests and report
 forms, but his communicative skills were somewhat sub-par.
 Perhaps the major was for some reason intimidated by the general, or his
 rank and office, but that would not do for the position he currently held,
 in the General's opinion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Major approached him at a respectful distance, as if the General
 emitted some kind of aura he did not wish to step on, he saluted crisply
 and asked him in a most professional, clipped tone of voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sir.
 You seemed to have stopped here for no apparent reason.
 Is there something of specific importance at this part of the walls, sir?
 You seem to have lost your color sir, if I may add.
 Perhaps you are feeling ill? Should I fetch the physician, sir?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge turned and stabbed the man with his eyes, his face a mixed expression
 of exasperation and wild disbelief.
 The General thought he would give the Major one last chance before he placed
 him at the front of a Thorax battalion.
 With no armor whatsoever.
 So, with evident effort to restrain himself he replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Should I require a physician, Major, I would ask for one myself.
 Unless of course I'm bleeding to death.
 But that's the reason you are my adjutant, it seems.
 You always remind me blissfully that I am not bleeding to death.
 You accomplish that with your hollow remarks and repetitively inane questions.
 I will ask you just this once Major, to act accordingly and spare me the
 dung.
 If there is something of import to be said, say it.
 If you think a question in matters of tactics and strategy pertinent, ask.
 You've proved to be an efficient man.
 Now, please prove to me you are an efficient soldier and not a paper-man.
 There will be death around here by nightfall.
 Don't ever ask me again if I'm feeling ill.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Major Guighan stood stock still, as the General's incisive remarks made
 their way to his heart and mind.
 Before the General could turn his gaze elsewhere, the Major managed to
 speak:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will not, sir.
 I realize now I had been wrong to assume you were a cold hearted bastard,
 sir.
 I could not bring myself to speak openly to a man who seemed not to care.
 I know differently now.
 With that being said, I believe we have made an extensive examination of
 the walls, and no notable weaknesses have been spotted.
 The patrols will try again at nighttime, though we are not expecting hopeful
 results.
 The men seem to be ready as they'll ever be for such a fight.
 Should we return to the staff tent and plan our tactical approach on the
 matter?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge was stunned to hear the man speak his mind after all this time.
 He believed no one had called him like that since he became General, and
 he also felt kind of hurt that a member of his staff would think him so.
 It actually meant then that the others thought so as well.
 He guessed the major would make amends though.
 After a somewhat awkward moment of silence, Tyrpledge replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'd never thought I'd pass for cold-hearted.

Ursempyre was fretfully looking over the tall arched balcony of the Disciplinari
um's east tower.
 His gaze was deeply woven with sorrow and hurt.
 His soul felt empty, broken.
 Whatever he had been planning, was now nothing but a dream.
 The gale of the wind brought to his nostrils the smell of ash and cinder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fires had started in some parts of Pyr.
 Fires from the siege engines of the Army.
 Tyrpledge was leading them, a good man as far as he could remember, as
 far as he could judge a man.
 He believed he no longer had that privilege.
 Who was he to judge others? A consummate traitor, by any account.
 He was bereft of the things he valued most: Truth, honor, friendship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had lied, and he had deceived.
 He had lost his honor and sworn oaths that had filled his mouth with venom
 and choler.
 He had sacrificed everything, to save something.
 And now this.
 Within a single night, he had been duped not once but twice.
 He had been played like a puppet, and now his people would pay the price.
 All of his people, not just the kinsfolk, not only those that were prepared
 to pay some price.
 Everyone would now pay for his failure, his lack of wisdom and foresight.
 He was arrogant, he could see that now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He believed him capable of achieving the dream of countless generations,
 seeing himself as the leader behind which the kinsfolk, the old-folk, would
 spread like wildfire, uniting the people against a tyranny as old as stone
 and earth.
 He believed he could have liberated them all, usher a new era where every
 breath would smell of freedom instead of fear and oppression.
 He loathed him! That was what had blinded him.
 Loathing, unquenched passion, blinding wrath.
 He was more than shrewd, he was a demon incarnate, laughing behind their
 backs, toying with their minds and souls.
 Every single thread of fate firmly in his hands like reins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only last night, he had thought that his the worst fate could have in store
 for him was horrible meaningless torture at the hands of the Patriarch
 and his cronies.
 Now he was in living hell, unable to even scream in agony.
 There was no point, none would listen to him now.
 He had been crushed, mind and spirit, in one blow.
 He had been quite effectively made redundant, irrelevant, obsolete.
 He should not have given his offer any thought.
 He should have denied him.
 Denied his immense powers, his demonic shell and form.
 He should have told him that his people were not afraid of death.
 That it did not matter for him if they perished in hellish flames of an
 uncanny nature, or bled their lives away one by one by sword and bow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But that would have been a lie, and the Patriarch would have seen through
 it.
 There was no hope all along, Ursempyre thought.
 As fate had brought things together, and life had shaped him into the man
 he is, there was indeed nothing that could be done.
 He had lost this fight before it had even began.
 He could now do nothing but watch idly from afar, hoping his people would
 survive, that they would endure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What would become of them then though? What had his mind devised? To what
 end, these extravagant machinations, this endless pulling of strings and
 dials, like the movement of wheels within wheels, a dizzying sensation,
 meant to disorient and mesmerize, while right behind us shadows were setting
 the real stage, Lord Remis thought in silence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch's purpose might have been unfathomable, but Ursempyre was
 only certain that it hold nothing good in stock for the people.
 If there was one thing he might try as a last attempt at redemption, was
 to try and learn as much as possible from the man.
 But he somehow felt that was as if trying to squeeze water out of stone,
 an impossible task either way one might look at it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sooner or later, Ursempyre thought, the army would find a way into the city.
 They had the men, the equipment, and the time to do so.
 And then the procrastinators would perhaps find a deserving end, unable
 to put up a fight, under-equipped and overwhelmed by numbers they would
 lose the fight for Pyr.
 Even though the total strength of the procrastinators had been summoned,
 it would take days, perhaps weeks for them to arrive in time to stem the
 tide of Tyrpledge's men.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre tried to imagine what must be going through the General's mind
 at such a time.
 Was he torn between his devotion to duty and his feelings for his fellow
 men? Or did he relish the prospect of exacting vengeance in the name of
 the rightful Castigator and the Pantheon? What lay in his heart? Was it
 furious anger? Was it righteous wrath? Blind dedication and dispassionate
 will, the markings of a professional soldier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He rather hoped the General was dumbfounded, left vacant inside at the realizati
on of this horrific reality.
 Perhaps he regarded all this with deep-seated consternation, and was troubled
 at his every step, haunted by images of the monstrous consequences his
 actions would have, for all of them.
 Was he such a man? He could not know, and was deadly afraid that he would
 like that question to be answered.
 It was only a matter of time before it did though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lord Remis was standing in front of the stone arch, the weight of his body
 supported by his hands touching the granite, as if they had been attached
 to it for ages, rigid as if they were not made of flesh.
 Servants had asked him to bring food and water.
 He had waved them away, but he could hear the frailness of their voices,
 their disbelief, their fear.
 He did not know what they feared most: the coming battle, the Patriarch,
 or the sudden realization that the world had come upside down in a single
 night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His guards outside the chamber had seemed equally perturbed.
 Though hand-selected from the ranks of the procrastinators, they were not
 as blind and unintelligent as their lesser comrades.
 He had seen the complexion on their faces turn into the color of ash, blood
 pumped away into their hearts lest it explode in shock, when they saw him
 appointed Castigator, in the stark middle of the night, with only the Patriarch
 and a few Disciplinarium officials to attend as witnesses.
 It all smelled wrong, even to simpletons such as these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He did not question for one second though, that should he try to act wildly,
 fear would overcome and their instincts would not be reined, and they would
 bring him down, as the Patriarch had ordered them to, 'for his own good'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On recollection, it seemed to Ursempyre that the Patriarch was somehow swinging
 this whole affair, precariously navigating between duplicity and lawfulness,
 trying to rewrite the Law and everything it had stood for since the very
 founding of the Territories.
 It was as if he had no clear view of the future he wanted to create for
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If indeed, the Patriarch planned for any future at all.
 Ursempyre thought such a being more than capable of planning nothing more
 than their complete extermination.
 The total annihilation of the Outer Territories, starting from here, from
 Pyr, the seat of power and Law.
 That would not be beyond a hateful being of such power, malevolence, and
 intelligence.
 The only thing that such a path would lack, would be reason.
 But then again, Ursempyre thought as he smiled bitterly and shook his head,
 who said reason had any part in all this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre could see now the smoke from the fires rising, procrastinators
 running in the streets, forcing people to follow them press-ganging them
 to be used as firemen, workers, craftsmen, and ultimately, he feared, fodder.
 The siege engines of the Army were starting their baleful song again, the
 thudding and creaking of huge catapults and trebuchets launching stone
 and lit barrels of tar against the city, indiscriminately, randomly.
 They were killing the same people they were meant to protect.
 How very much like something the Patriarch would have conjured in his ineffable
 mind and ultimate wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sniggered bitterly despite himself.
 Then he heard a sparkling voice, and could almost see the insipid smile
 behind the words of the Patriarch without needing to turn:

Ursempyre turned to face him, his eyes sizzling with hatred.
 He felt like lunging at him and ending this farce before he had to bear
 witness to the atrocities that would stain every street with blood and
 fire.
 But that would be cowardice, another treasonous step towards the hell that
 awaited men like him.
 No, he would try and make something out this charade he had been forced
 to play in.
 So, he indulged the Patriarch's cruel sociability and answered with a flat,
 stern voice:

 in it, as if he had genuine curiosity.

Calling me names, Castigator? How improper for a man of your rank and lineage.
 It has been my firm conviction ever since I can remember myself that the
 true nature of things certainly lies in their death.
 Only when something dies, can anyone really understand what it's true nature
 was.
 Trees wither into ghastly dried hulks of wood.
 Plants rot away and turn into dust, returning to the soil.
 Man is a beast, and like most beasts, he is made of flesh and bone, and
 the maggots make good use of him when he is dead.

The Patriarch very carefully intoned the last word with a certain nuance
 that made it sound hollow.
 Coming out of his mouth the word sounded like a wooden mallet brought down
 upon a plank.
 Ursempyre's blood was coursing fast and hot through his body, but he kept
 his temper in check, trying to make good use of his aggravation at being
 forced to play with words:

The Patriarch was looking at an exquisitely fashioned silver egg encrusted

 Though, it would be more than a surprise if you did.

The Patriarch summoned a sardonic smile that made Ursempyre feel queasy.
 He was relentlessly carving up his mind and soul to feast on at his leisure.
 His words infuriated him and tore him apart at the same time.
 The Patriarch noticed he was not going to reply and pressed on:

What are you thinking now, Ursempyre? I told you I can't read minds, not
 unaided.
 But I do take delight in toying with you, that much is certain.
 Why you ask? Should it be beneath me? A being of my powers? You talk as
 if you could understand me fully, as you know the extend of my abilities.
 You've made the same mistake as the men before you.
 Like Shan, especially like him.
 You think of me driven by the same desires and needs as you.

\begin_layout Standard
Do you really think this is about power? The ability to control others?
 That is nothing but a tool to wield.
 Power can be used to transform people, bend them, chastise them, shape
 them.
 Isn't that much more fun than simply using a person? I could talk around
 it for hours, Ursempyre, but you would still lack the acuity of spirit
 to grasp the notion in its fullness.
 How could I explain something so simple to such an occluded mind as yours?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vying for a freedom you would fail to maintain.
 Unable to control yourself in the simplest of urges, you would wish you'd
 be able to assert control over power itself, share it as if it were pie.
 The weak-minded leading the blind over a sheer precipice.
 Would you take the plunge first of them all, Ursempyre? Would you lead
 by example, like a good ruler? Would you become their final, benevolent
 dictator? Would you ruin my game?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's what it feels like for me, Ursempyre, a game where I can have it
 all if I want to but I choose to play by some rules.
 I set the scene, and act my part, with you as unknown partners.
 What makes it so grandiose, Lord Remis, is the fact that for the most part,
 you are willing partners.
 None of this foolishness you dream of, simple lust.
 Passion.
 Life exploding from every inch of your pathetic existence in contrast to
 your inane mewling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is life, Ursempyre, and I'm living it.
 I'm living it as I please and there's no one to make me stop, no one to
 make me hurt, no one to make me feel anything other than great about it.
 If you could ever aspire to something Ursempyre it would be to aspiring
 to a perception as clear and total as mine.
 You would not weep then, indeed the idea would bring tears of laughter
 to your eyes.
 You would see the true nature of things.
 Despair now, for you very well know you have nothing else left to do in
 this world.

He felt inundated with anger and sorrow and wanted to vent, spill this rueful
 cup of emotions he carried.
 He could not find the strength to do so.
 By all means, the Patriarch had managed to break him, force his will into

 them and their tyranny.

\begin_layout Standard
He had not foreseen it all stemmed from this man.
 That was his biggest failing, the breaking point where he had been canceled,
 turned into a shadow, a creeping thing that should cease to be.
 He felt like his very being was an affront to man.
 His dark thoughts swallowed Ursempyre whole, and he lay there on the floor
 of his chambers, upon a carpet with the embroidery of the Castigator, weeping
 for himself, mourning for the future that would not come, a people that
 would cease to be.

He had helped in that crime, he saw it again more fully now, and he had
 been unable to do anything, even now, with the root of the cause standing

 He was a lesser man, he knew now.
 There would be no turning back, for no one.
 Parts of his mind urged him to endure, but his soul was crushed, the spirit
 gone.
 The Patriarch was right all along; he would despair, because nothing else
 was left for him to do.

Ikebod leaned his head carefully out of the corner of the street, and looked
 up the street to his right.
 Once he was assured it was safe, he motioned behind him.
 Celia and two trusted guards from House Remis came to his side.
 The guards wore non-nondescript armor and clothing, plain, unadorned and
 utilitarian.
 Their faces wore stern expressions, exuding an air of determination and
 professionalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia looked wary, but she felt confident of her guides.
 She thought Ikebod would even give his life to protect her, if it ever
 came to that.
 Which was more than a mere thought, with the City burning, under siege.
 The smoke from the various small fires hung thick in the air, the light
 breeze blowing through the city of Pyr unable to clear the atmosphere.
 The rosy red of the coming dusk was mingled with the sooty gray of the
 smoke, turning into a dark crimson red, gloomy and menacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They hurried across the street where the shadows would offer them some degree
 of protection from ever searching eyes.
 Word around the kinsfolk was that the procrastinators had begun press-ganging
 people in the streets, eagerly searching for any poor soul that happened
 to wander.
 Houses were being invaded and the men forcibly taken away from their families.
 It seemed that it had all begun quite the other way around from what it
 had been planned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of leading the revolution, Lord Ursempyre Remis had suddenly sided
 with the Patriarch.
 It was more than a bitter blow to the Kin.
 It was an unimaginable, completely unthinkable event, that nevertheless
 had come to pass just the night before.
 From what Celia could gather from the dealings of Ikebod with various people
 from the kinsfolk while they still remained at House Remis, they were not
 safe in the estate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had to flee, and disperse.
 The various cells, the people in the organization delegated with some degree
 of organizational responsibility would convene somewhere else, in one of
 the places prepared elsewhere according to a carefully laid out contingency
 plan.
 No one had thought though that Lord Remis would be absent, indeed turn
 traitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had not known the man personally, but from the people around him, working
 with him, she could not understand such a thing.
 Amonas was one such man, and he could never turn traitor, his heart and
 mind utterly devoted to their cause.
 He had dreamt of a better future, and he had shared that vision with her.
 They were planning to raise their child in a bright, hopeful future.
 What would become of that vision now that everything seemed to crumble
 like a wall of dried mud? She felt the child kick with vigor, blissfully
 unaware of what was transpiring in the world it would be born in soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were walking briskly, anxiously throwing gazes all around them, wary
 of being seen.
 Ikebod was leading them through the streets instead of the underground
 passages because he was afraid they might have been compromised.
 If procrastinators were indeed running around the underground passage looking
 for kinsfolk, they would be caught like mice with nowhere to run.
 While running on the streets presented a more obvious danger, it also offered
 them more venues of escape.
 It was a gambit they hoped would not fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They could hear the distant cries of procrastinators and the thuds of impacts
 from the siege engines.
 The army was methodical in his approach, wearing down the defenders of
 the city, forcing them to occupy themselves with the spreading fires that
 threatened to engulf the city in a firestorm that would burn the city of
 Pyr to the ground, along with most of its populace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the opportune time arrived, they would then probably try to breach
 the walls in their weakest point, or storm them in mass, whichever would
 seem to offer the best chances of entering the city.
 As things stood, it was a matter of time.
 The most pressing issue now was, what the kinsfolk would do in this mayhem?
 Would they try and rescue the city and its people from certain destruction?
 Or should they try and flee.
 Ikebod had seemed reticent to disclose any more of his thoughts on the
 matter, but he seemed to have his mind occupied with many other unvoiced
 concerns.
 Celia hoped he could also propose some solution, some idea that would bring
 hope instead of the gloomy despair and doubt that seemed to hang in the
 air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had reached another crossroads now, and they were about to emerge in
 a brightly lit wide road.
 They were hiding in a dark alleyway, the light from the street casting
 flickering shadows on the walls around them.
 Ikebod and one of the guards peered over the street.
 Ikebod motioned the guard to hide again.
 He seemed agitated when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Procrastinators.
 Two, maybe tree squads.
 They are herding a throng of people.
 It seems they're going to pass this way soon.

 I can see them holding buckets, and jogging briskly.
 We have to double back.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guards nodded in acknowledgement and turned around to go back the way
 they came.
 Ikebod gently pushed Celia to follow them, with him right behind her.
 Suddenly, the guards in front of them froze, and drew their swords.
 A patrol of procrastinators had seen them, and they yelled:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
They had drawn their swords and were rushing to meet them.
 The guards drew their sword and stood their ground, ready for the procrastinato

 One of the guards turned around to Celia and Ikebod and told them in a
 quiet, determined way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The way is blocked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ikebod nodded crisply and took Celia by the arm.
 She turned around and opened her mouth to protest, but soon her feet were
 galloping in the pace Ikebod set.
 His pull became stronger as she seemed to hesitate, but she yielded, her
 instincts driving her body rather than her mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They crossed the wide street without caring whether they or not they would
 be seen.
 It no longer mattered.
 They would now have to make haste, they had been seen.
 As they ran down the streets of Pyr, passing through small alleys and brightly
 lit roads, they realized night had come and the building and houses around
 them were lit by firelight.
 Pyr was burning.
 Celia felt a sudden pang of fear grip her heart and instinctively tightened
 her grip on Ikebod's arm.
 The wizened, trusted servant of House Remis told her soothingly as they
 ran together:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Her feet felt somehow lighter and despite her carrying, she made good speed
 and did not slow them down much.
 Ikebod was also straining himself, though she believed he was leading them
 with a fast pace, especially for a man his age.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They heard confounded voices shouting directions.
 Other procrastinators must have been alarmed of their presence.
 They could hear the galloping of horses on the cobbled streets around them.
 It felt like an invisible noose was tightening around them, and was about
 to close tight too soon for comfort.

Ikebod urged her to hurry and spoke to her while out of breath:

\begin_layout Standard
He freed himself from her grip and started heading the way they came.
 She stood there transfixed for a moment, and then thought of her child.
 She believed she would feel torn inside, but the decision came instinctively.
 She ran with all the alacrity she could muster, holding her abdomen with
 care, while she tried to follow Ikebod's directions to the letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She felt like crying, but the tension prevented her from doing so.
 She really hoped Ikebod would somehow make it alive out of this ordeal,
 but she did not really expect him to do so.
 She wasn't even sure about herself and her child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She turned to the street Ikebod had told her, and saw the blacksmith's shop,
 derelict and shabby from the outside, wooden planks barely concealing broken
 windows, and a shrank, shabby wooden door only half-closed, a rusty chain
 holding it from falling down, a lock that seemed to be purely decorative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She thought she heard then the pained cry of Ikebod from afar, echoing over
 the stones of the streets.
 She did not stop or look behind, she knew there was no point.
 She was in the dark alley, looking at a rather sturdy looking door.
 She knocked thrice, and after a brief pause of silence, a reply sounded,
 in the form of two knocks.
 She hesitated for a second and then knocked only once.
 Another small silence followed, and the door opened, barely a fist wide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moonlight shone upon a grimy, ugly face of a man, who asked her sharply,
 without even bothering to look at her for a moment:

Celia was surprised, and instinctively took a step back.
 She searched her mind for a moment, and could not recall Ikebod telling
 her any password.
 She was worried she might have misheard, or in the panic of the moment
 forgotten about it.
 Without anything else to reply, she simply told the man what she could:

 As he led her through the darkness of the shop, he asked her:

He reached for the floor then, and pulled a hatch, then lowered a small
 ladder from somewhere nearby.
 Dim light filled the place.
 He motioned her inside with a wave of his hand.
 She hesitated and asked him:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded and went down the small flight of steps, and heard the hatch
 close behind her.
 She was standing in a corridor carved in rock, with lit torches affording
 the place enough light for someone to walk without running onto a wall.
 In the distance, she could only see darkness, but she thought she could
 hear a din of sorts, like men talking, some of the voices louder than the
 others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She walked with an almost wary pace, not knowing where the corridor led.
 She felt unsure now, vulnerable.
 She thought of Ikebod, and renewed her trust in him and his words.
 She should be safe here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she walked towards the dark end of the corridor, she could see light
 pouring in from one side.
 The din grew louder, and now the sound of quarreling voices was evident.
 She felt pain in her lower abdomen, and flinched.
 With every step she took, the voices grew clearer.
 She could now clearly hear men having a very loud argument, many people
 trying to speak at once, a cacophony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She reached the end of the corridor and stepped through a narrow opening
 into a wide, much more brightly lit cave, large enough for hundreds of
 people, like a chamber of sorts.
 Large stalactites hung from the ceiling and where mirrored in some places
 by their corresponding stalagmites.
 Some stalagmites seemed cut by man, and others had joined with the stalactites
 forming columns, some thin, others thick as pillars.
 The bright light was coming from numerous torches and braziers, casting
 enormous shadows on the walls of the cave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She could see more than a hundred men standing, with maybe a dozen of them
 standing separately from the others, forming somewhat of a circle around
 a brazier that seemed to stand squarely in the middle of the cave.
 They were shouting at each other and she could not make out a single phrase.
 It was as if the market of Pyr had secretly gathered in here, each man
 trying to sell his wares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She took a few more steps closer and she felt pain in her lower abdomen
 again, this time more acute.
 She let out a single cry as the pain left her with stabbing sensation,
 and made her gasp.
 A couple of men that were standing closer to her, almost isolated from
 the throng of people, must have heard her, and turned to look.
 They were surprised, and quickly strode to her side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They seemed wary, even suspicious of her.
 As she stood there with an expression of pain still written on her features,
 one of the man grabbed her gently by the arm, noticing she was carrying.
 She asked her then, while the other man overlooked, and the cacophony behind
 them continued unabated:

The pain welling up from inside her numbed her senses, she gasped and struggled
 to stand on her feet, clutching the other arm of the man for support.
 At the mention of Ikebod's name they seemed to relax somewhat, but furrowed
 brows appeared on their faces.
 The man who hadn't yet spoken, asked her:

 first sense to return to Hilderich was smell.
 He could make out the distinct sharpness of metal lingering on his nostrils.
 He sniffed some more air and felt its odorless freshness enter his lungs.
 His breath was easy now.
 He opened his eyes and his sight adjusted to the ambient dim light.
 He felt his ribs with a hand and could feel no pain.
 It seemed that what had transpired seemingly moments before was not a dream.
 He was feeling fine, his broken ribs seemed to have mended miraculously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw the place they were in: It was a small room, non-nondescript, walls
 greenish hues all around, a shape of many corners, and a relatively high
 ceiling etched in shadow.
 There was no obvious source of lighting, nothing in the way of a lamp or
 a torch.
 It was as if faint light somehow seeped through the walls and the floor,
 as if moonlight could pass inside this strange chamber.
 Amonas was lying right beside him unconscious or perhaps sleeping.
 They were both sitting on what seemed to be a circular dais with a glassy
 surface, a material that only cast the tiniest of reflections, and seemed
 to absorb what little light there was in an uncanny manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich felt refreshed, invigorated.
 He stood up and gazed around the chamber.
 He was curious of their new surroundings, and believed that they had probably
 arrived at what that voice had called the centron.
 It was a quite a long stretch taking the words of a disembodied voice seriously
, but he felt he should put some trust in something that can mended his
 body without pain, effort, or time.
 What mattered right now to Hilderich was that they were off that accursed
 place that came close to claiming his life.
 They were not quite where they were hoping to be, but they were on their
 way, and that was a truly blissful achievement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The room was otherwise uninteresting, sporting a single door barely recognizable
 by its very thin frame, probably made of the same material as the walls.
 As he was searching for other signs around the room, anything that would
 pique his interest, he heard Amonas beside him grunt and moan slightly.
 He turned around to look at him and smiled brightly:

Amonas looked disoriented, dizzy, as if he had been very recently hit on

 He managed to ask Hilderich with his usually gruff voice sounding even

Here! The centron, if the voice we heard is to be believed.
 I, for one, cannot think otherwise; my broken ribs are mended, my lungs

Amonas looked around him, soaking up his surroundings, flexing the muscles
 in his hands and head with deliberate motions.
 His face wore pained expressions at some of the moments, as if he had been
 injured or strained.
 Hilderich noticed and asked him:

It feels as if my head is about to pop open.

Indeed.
 But we're not quite back home yet.
 And I've been thinking only just a few moments ago..
 My master's work were the keystones.
 He had this theory..
 Well, many theories but I was not privy to the bulk of his work.
 I was supposed to find a man that held all the answers I could ever hope
 for.
 Indeed, all the answers our world could hope for.
 This man, the Stoneforger, I believe he's here.

Amonas looked at Hilderich in pure disbelief.

 asked Hilderich with a puzzled voice:

Please, hear me out.
 I believe the Stoneforger is here.
 I believe that the voice that spoke to us and tended to my wounds is indeed
 what it claimed to be, from what I could gather, an ancient technological
 marvel.
 Do not easily ascribe such wonders to things as magic and Gods, Amonas.
 You were right to believe our world is built upon heaps of lies and deceit.
 I do not know what you saw when you stepped into that pillar of light the
 first time, but this time, that pillar of light brought us here, and I
 believe all the evidence you will ever need to show me is here, in this
 place, the centron.

Amonas was staring at him now with a frown, his silence a clear sign for
 Hilderich to continue:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is vast knowledge and certainly intelligence of some sort here, Amonas.
 It must be this man, this person I'm seeking.
 Though my reasoning is that he is so much more than a simple man.
 But he exists.
 He should exist.
 Everything points to that logical assumption.
 My master had devoted most of his life searching out for more clues to
 prove the existence of a place very much like what we are standing in now.
 It would cause him to gape in awe and astonishment surely, because he believed
 this place belonged to an era long ago forgotten, to a civilization totally
 extinct.
 He believed these were for the most part relics, Amonas.
 But as you've seen, there is much more to that.
 Inane artifacts like stone and marble and brick do not speak with disembodied
 voices, Amonas, that much is certain.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas shook his head and replied to Hilderich as he stood up, his gaze
 now bearing tension.
 He still wore a pained expression on his face, only this time it was mingled
 with wariness and suppressed annoyance.
 He believed he was beginning to understand what Hilderich was about to
 propose and he did not relish the thought.
 He asked him tersely:

All I know is that the keystone is what has enabled us to reach this place.
 A keystone that was in the care of my master, who had spent years of his
 life connecting the keystones with other devices, and an extinct civilization
 of extreme sophistication.
 The keystone, the voice, all we've seen so far are indeed proof of the
 concepts and theories in his studies.

Amonas sighed and exhaled deeply before asking Hilderich with an increasingly
 exasperated look on his face:

I could never have hoped to happen upon such marvels by mere perseverance,
 Amonas.
 I would have spent my days around arcane texts and chronicles, researches,
 studies and dusty volumes written by men who had lost their minds in the
 process.
 A process that would take me years, perhaps decades to carry through myself,
 analyzing and cross-checking references, names, places, artifacts.
 It would have claimed the better years of my life.
 And it would have proven a futile endeavor just like the one my master
 had embarked upon.

At the mention of Hilderich's master, Amonas brought to his mind the image
 of Cimon, always a thoughtful person, gentle and kind.
 A good friend with which he had spent many nights discussing the finer
 points of drinking.
 He was soothing for his soul, Cimon.
 And he had met Celia because of him.
 He owed him more than a fleeting memory.
 His face mellowed somewhat, he even felt the headache had subsided as well.
 He asked Hilderich with a calm, friendly voice this time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know he was troubled by some arcane mysteries, but he was most circumspect
 about his work.
 I never knew details.
 All I knew was that he had become unwanted in the circles of the Curatoria.
 What exactly happened?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich sighed and took a deep breath, as if about to apologize for a
 grievous mistake in the past that he could not make amends for.
 He then replied to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Even though he was the first Curator to assemble enough evidence to support
 such a theory, when he presented his work he was met with derision, laughed
 upon as another half-mad fool.
 Sadly, only few of his friends and colleagues supported him in public and
 pleaded for him to maintain his status as Curator, albeit on the condition
 that he would burn the bulk of his work and renounce it as a work of fiction.
 He had never broached the subject during my apprenticeship.
 I learned about it from my surreptitious ventures into his personal study.
 To tell you the truth, I did not believe him either, and sided silently
 with those who considered him little more than deranged.
 I was sorely mistaken and the proof came in the worst of ways, the day
 my master died.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas nodded thoughtfully, looking for a moment away from Hilderich, biting
 his lip with a hint of consternation, as if sudden angst filled him.
 He then shot an even gaze to Hilderich and asked him:

If it was by fate or chance alone, it really matters little to me now, but
 we have gone through a bewildering journey to end up in a place where myth
 meets reality.
 In a sense, stepping through that pillar of light was both a blessing and
 a curse.
 We're here now, Amonas, closer than ever.
 I need to find him.
 Not just for my sake, or my master's sake.
 It would be a revelation that could change the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't you see? We have to find him first and foremost before we do anything
 else.
 Answers to everything you could possibly imagine, Amonas.
 Everything is here.
 Everything began here.
 It must have.
 This is the place of legend man has locked out of his mind, but has kept
 it in his soul.
 A world that is somehow connected to our own.
 A world steeped in technology undreamt of.
 Common links from our past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have to find him, Amonas.
 Or his people.
 Their history, their lore.
 We must have access to it so we can learn our own past.
 Don't you see? We walk into a pillar of light and then end up in another
 world, another sun, without a moon! And now we're here, somewhere.
 Going back and finding the Stoneforger, those are now intertwined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can't go back unless we unlock some of the mysteries behind all these
 wonders we've witnessed.
 Whatever makes this place, this world even, tick, we have to find out about
 it.
 Let's find him, Amonas.
 Only then will we be able to go back.
 Unless you think we could just open up that door and be right where we
 wanted to be.

Amonas stood staring at Hilderich's eyes, a tiny glitter barely visible
 in their black.
 He felt compelled.
 The words rang true to his ears.
 He only believed he was doing the right thing when he at length said to
 Hilderich, gesturing with a slight nod:

They were now walking through a stupendous underground cavern of exquisite
 beauty.
 Huge crystals of many colors and large clear-cut facets hung from the ceiling,
 mirroring their walking figures with pristine clarity, sparkling from the
 faint light that filled the vast space with remarkable ease.
 Some of their reflections were large enough to see, even though the roof
 of this gigantic enclosure was improbably high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simply looking at it filled them with awe but disoriented them as well,
 making them feel queasy after a while.
 They had been walking on a narrow gangway that connected two crevices on
 opposite sides of the cavern.
 Far below their feet, furious swirls of white hot and molten red rock churned
 with rage, their emitted incandescence gracing the thought-defying towers
 that seemed to vanish into the infernal abyss with an eerie glow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cavern had stunned them with their wild, harsh beauty when they first
 laid eyes upon it.
 And the towers had been another unfathomable wonder that imagination would
 have failed to conjure.
 They rose from the depths of the inferno of molten rock and lava up to
 the level of the unique gangway that traversed this astounding cavity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their surface was matte black, almost obsidian-like.
 It very much seemed to resemble the material the bullhorns were made of,
 but it lacked the same refinement.
 It seemed as if this was more coarse in nature, more suited to the harsh
 environment they were set in.
 Indeed their foundations seemed to lie in a hellish sea of fire where every
 nothing could ever hope to remain intact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, these towers endured.
 A thin lattice of glass-like pipes connected the towers as if they formed
 a grid.
 Bright white light seemed to flow through them with slow, deliberate pulses.
 A marvel of technology, certainly a feat of engineering only a civilization
 hundreds of thousand of years old could hope to achieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had passed through various corridors along the way, not all of them
 uniform in appearance and size.
 Some were brightly lit, sporting white paneled walls of porcelain-like
 material, others were dimly light, in the fashion of the room they had
 woken up in.
 Some were pitch black, none of their features visible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most were in pristine condition, like people lived in this place and dutifully
 kept it clean and polished, but they had not met a single soul.
 Their senses informed them that this place was void of life, deserted,
 abandoned.
 No smell or sound gave away the presence of living men.
 There were no cobwebs, no dust, no grime to call this place abandoned,
 forlorn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it was uncannily void of life in general, as if everyone around had
 left in a hurry, no trace they even existed behind.
 But surely men must have walked past these walls, for though varied, they
 seemed designed and engineered to accommodated men.
 Men like them, not giants, demons, or Gods.
 It was fascinating to uncover such a common trait with men from an undeniably
 very distant, glorious past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a strange mix, this network of corridors and passages.
 As if it had been built by different people, at different times, adding,
 removing, restructuring as they saw fit, by whim or necessity, it was impossibl
e to know.
 Hilderich had felt filled with wonder and awe at the prospect of systematically
 mapping these passages, thousands of questions formed in his mind seeking
 answers, in-fighting for a quota of attention and thinking time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the moment they left the chamber where they woke up in, they had followed
 an almost random course, generally preferring lit paths whenever possible.
 They had ended up in dead-ends, mostly doors that would not open of their
 volition like most of them did.
 They had backtracked and chosen alternate tracks.
 Amonas had suggested that they somehow keep track of their path, lest they
 end up going in circles in a place which had no labels to follow, and no
 map as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich had calmed Amonas down and told him he'd keep track of their path
 in his mind, as there was no other way to do so.
 Marking the walls was impossible, as they seemed impervious to Amonas knife,
 unable to even put a slight notch on their surface, irrespective of the
 force exerted and the effort spent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had paid out in the end, since their path had taken them to the crystal-roofe
d cavern, with a brightly lit gate on the opposite end of the gangway.
 The gangway itself was as non-nondescript as the walls they had seen so
 far, but what had genuinely picked Amonas' interest, apart from the immensity
 of all that surrounded them, was that the gangway did not possess any guardrail
s, as if it was impossible for someone to trip himself and hurl himself
 down to certain death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas shared his concern before they had even made the first steps, cautious
 as ever.
 Hilderich briefly pondered such a scenario and with a wild grin on his
 face, before Amonas could react, he had tried to simply walk off the gangway
 into the churning lava below.
 He had stopped in mid air, with a silver sheen suddenly adorning the wispy
 air around his leg and knee, as if an invisible wall stood on each side
 of the gangway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas had sighed and scolded Hilderich in a fashion that made Hilderich
 laugh with all his heart.
 Amonas did not perceive the whole incident with the same amount of good
 humor and for quite some time he wore an expression of mild exasperation.
 If one did not know better he could have mistaken him as having his feelings
 genuinely hurt because of Hilderich's lack of consideration.
 It was dangerously immature, Amonas thought, for someone to behave so precariou
sly in such a place of unknown danger and roaming uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich did not seem to notice, and if he did, he seemed not to care.
 In fact, it seemed that he was impervious to anything less than the magnificenc
e of the wonders, both natural and technological, that surrounded them while
 on that gangway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While they were walking on the gangway with an easy pace, almost casually
 in fact, Hilderich asked Amonas without turning to look behind him:
\end_layout

Impossible to imagine, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas did not answer him, and remained silent as ever.
 He was not gazing around him like Amonas did, woolgathering.
 He seemed preoccupied, lost in wary thoughts of where all this might lead.
 He could still remember stepping on that pillar of light, and could certainly
 remember their tribulations in that hot steamy world with one sun and no
 moon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this place, this centron, where was this place if not on that same world?
 Where were they now? Until he would find these answers, his mind would
 not cease to worry.
 He tried to remember more of what the voice had been saying, but he had
 been utterly confounded by its explanations, if one could attribute that
 term to incoherent ramblings of a dubious nature.
 His mind was also still jarred by the headache that had subsided considerably
 by now, but a sting of it still lingered and made his thinking muddied
 and unclear, his most recent memories a blur.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It troubled him most that Hilderich's mind seemed to wonder.
 He had turned from a reserved, cautiously inquisitive man, into an enthusiastic
 juvenile that would not leave a rock unturned until he satisfied his insatiable
 lust for knowledge.
 He felt as if he had been forcibly restrained, not free to speak his mind.
 He had agreed to such a course, he was committed now.
 But he found it less and less wise with every passing minute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had found nothing to drink or eat, and every door that they had been
 able to open lead into what might have been living quarters, or other utility
 rooms.
 Some chambers contained metal crates they could not open and frustration
 had built up inside Amonas.
 Hilderich was so excited with each new little discovery that he seemed
 unperturbed by the fact that like all living things, they needed food and
 water, and they had found naught.
 As if the people that used to live here in ages past conjured their food
 out of thin air.
 To Amonas, this place was even harsher than the steamy wilderness they
 had left behind.
 At least there, they could find something to eat and drink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what of their vaunted attempts at gaining knowledge, Amonas thought
 with aggravation.
 What had they found out so far that they could use? Almost nothing of import.
 All they knew was that they were somewhere underground, and that they had
 found out when they ran across the cavern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sighed and looked at Hilderich in front of him, who seemed to be filled
 with vigor and an enthusiasm he had not thought possible.
 Perhaps he was rushing his judgment on this matter.
 It was in fact an unfortunate series of events that had led them here,
 to a bleak place that seemed to offer little, but they were here for mere
 hours.
 He supposed it was too early to expect much from their wanderings.
 But soon they would have to worry about sustenance, purely in a practical
 sense.
 Amonas decided to let it be for now, but he felt his unease would only
 grow given time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon, they were standing at the end of the gangway, a small plateau opening
 before them, where the large gate stood, a work of man set against a jutting
 rock wall that seemed to crash upon the gate like a granite waterfall held
 in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was marveling at the dimensions of the gate.
 It seemed large enough for a siege engine of the army to pass through,
 almost three stories high and as wide as the keep.
 Hilderich wondered what manner of things, machines and people, had passed
 through these gates.
 It was indeed larger than any other gate he had seen.
 What manner of need had led to it being designed and built to these dimensions?
 Another mystery for him to solve when time allowed it, he thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas spoke then, his voice sounding somewhat distant, as if his mind was
 removed elsewhere and he was merely glimpsing what surrounded him:

Hilderich took notice of the strangeness in Amonas voice, but he did not
 pay too much attention to it.
 It was probably the aching headache that did not seem to be leaving him
 in peace.
 He turned then and replied to Amonas:

Yes..

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas shook his head as if trying to clear his mind, as if his vision was
 blurry and his mind fumbling to find the words.
 He nodded then lightly, his gaze drifting away from Hilderich.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Alright.
 I see.
 How do you propose we do that? Are there any levers? Any wheels to turn?
 Should we knock?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's brow was furrowed.
 He did not know what to make of Amonas' strange behavior.
 These mood swings and the evident trouble he had concentrating fully, these
 were things he would have to ask him about once they stopped.
 Preferably when they had something to eat.
 He was indeed beginning to feel famished.
 It was the endless fascination and enthusiasm that kept him going, the
 tension, the thrill.
 He noticed Amonas' was looking at him with an aggravated, expectant look,
 and answered him in an excusatory tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ahm.
 No, though it might come to that.
 Knocking, that is.
 There seem to be no visible controls no, which would suggest that this
 gate can only be opened from the inside.
 Or, that it's just another large door that opens up on itself like the
 ones before.
 We'll just have to see now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas grunted with restrained disapproval and nodded.
 Hilderich had known Amonas to be circumspect at times, taciturn and almost
 spartan in his words sometimes, but he had never showed feeling of dislike
 or animosity towards him.
 He was beginning to feel that had somehow changed since they arrived in
 this place, the centron.
 Maybe he was having second thoughts about their change of plans.
 Maybe this place made him uneasy because of its otherworldliness, its antiquity.
 Maybe it was because they were still alone, not a soul in sight.
 With the exception of that weird voice, if it indeed had a soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After his brief inner contemplation, Hilderich stepped on the flattened
 plateau of rock.
 It seemed to be cut smoothly and then carefully smoothed, just short of
 turning its surface into a slippery, polished trap.
 He took a few more steps, and stood before the gate, gazing at its minimalistic
 features.
 It's singe door seemed to be made out of a dull gray, not a single ray
 of light reflected off its surface.
 It almost looked like stone, but it had no pores, no cuts, no graves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich looked at it with one eye.
 It's flat gray surface reminded him of bricks made of argyle and ash.
 The border of the gate were different, though.
 They were a uniform white material, almost porcelain-like, glossy, with
 a smooth reflective quality.
 The two pieces did not seem to fit together at all.
 Hilderich thought there should be some sort of adequate explanation for
 that, but whoever built this gate did not seem available for answers.
 Hilderich conjured the image of the builder of the gate being asked why
 the colors in his gate seemed wrong, and the childish thought brought a
 grin to his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As much as he looked, Hilderich indeed could not discern any sort of controls,
 levers, ropes, weights, wheels, nothing a gate would be associated with
 in his experience.
 Then again, it would have been almost ridiculous to expect such crude forms
 of mechanisms in such a landscape after what they had witnessed.
 But it never hurt to check the obvious things first.
 So, he simply leaned against the door, standing smack before the middle
 of the gate, and pushed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing seemed to happen.
 He turned around and looked at Amonas, shrugging his shoulders.
 His look was apologetic in nature, and at length he said to Amonas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I'm sorry.
 Nothing you would expect in a gate of this size.
 I guess we should try knocking after all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich thought Amonas had a very strange expression on his face.
 To him, it looked as if Amonas had felt incredibly stupid somehow, perhaps
 like if he had tried to cut a rope with his knife still sheathed, or poured
 himself a glass of wine from an empty bottle and drank it anyway.
 It was the look of a deeply dumbfounded man.
 Hilderich was suddenly worried, believing the man to be sick, in need of
 aid.
 At length, even though he seemed unable to speak, Amonas managed to point
 with his hand to the gate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich turned around and to his great surprise, saw the door had vanished,
 a sight that defied the very sense of human sight assaulting his vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was now standing in front of a hall of sorts, only the word did it no
 justice at all.
 It was a gargantuan circular chamber of immense radius, nothing short of
 a small plain.
 It must have been the area of a small township, complete with the surrounding
 fields.
 It would probably take them hours or the better part of a day to walk across
 it.
 Its dimension in height was almost impossible to measure.
 The walls ran above his field of vision.
 And there was something about the lighting that seemed recognizable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His feet moved of their own volition then, guiding him to enter this vast
 space proper, see better, even though sight alone was incapable of handling
 such a view.
 Air wafted down upon him, as if from an overhead opening.
 It was dry and chilly, almost cold.
 Instinctively, he looked up, expecting to see some sort of mind-boggling
 roof structure, something truly awe-inspiring as the rest of this vast
 enclosed space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a mix of terror, bewilderment, joy and disbelief that contorted his
 face in an almost painful way, what he saw, was clear blue sky set between
 the circular edges of the walls, as if looking down a very long pipe.
 The distance was immense, unimaginable.
 Sunlight shafted down in an angled column overhead and its reflections
 on the surface of the walls gave this place this familiar ambient light.
 As he looked up, he saw the bright ring of the sun appearing over the edge
 of the walls.
 In a moment or two, the pillar of light would fall on him, bathing him
 with light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He turned around to Amonas, who stood where he was, transfixed.
 He called out to him, gesturing wildly with his hands to come and see for
 himself.
 Amonas shook suddenly, as if waking up from a living nightmare, almost
 trembling.
 He shook his head, and came to Hilderich's side with a brisk pace.
 His gaze wandered around as if this was a strange hall or just another
 chamber, unable to feel mesmerized at the impossibility of the scale surroundin
g them.
 He just said then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's..
 big.
 Very big.
 Huge, indeed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich spared a moment to look at him sideways.
 The significance of Hilderich's furrowed look was lost to Amonas, who looked
 extravagantly out of place, acting almost non-nonchalantly, something that
 was indeed very much unlike him.
 Hilderich did not press the matter, and instead point at the sky, the bright
 rim of the sun glinting at the far edge of the wall.
 He pointed upwards and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look how far these walls reach.
 This is colossal.
 The sun can barely reach this far down this sort of, shaft, for lack of
 a better word.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hmm.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas suddenly looked thoughtful, as if contemplating not what Hilderich
 had said, but rather as if he was trying to come up with a better word
 than 'shaft'.
 Hilderich was about to ask Amonas about this sudden rush of strange behavior,
 but then the sun shone upon them, momentarily blinding them, causing them
 both to squint and use their hands to block out the sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that small sliver of shade that allowed them to peep sheepishly at the
 sun, Hilderich could see its ring grow, the bright sphere grow larger.
 It look strange though.
 As the light had looked eerily familiar.
 The sun did not seem to give off that green hue.
 It looked..
 normal, Hilderich thought.
 And then, he saw a sight that had sorely been missed.
 As the sun grew whole, another blueish ring appeared over the edge of the
 wall, at that other end of this huge shaft.
 A second sun.
 The second sun.
 There were two suns.
 They were home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The realization struck Hilderich like a sledgehammer, and he physically
 reeled from the place he stood.
 He was frantic, his gaze switching between Amonas and the sky with cataleptic
 speed.
 He opened his mouth as if to speak but he simply managed to gasp.
 All the while, Amonas was still looking at the suns, in a sort of peaceful
 gaze, the falling streaks of sunlight adding a glow to his face that made
 him look more splendid and grandiose than ever, despite his disheveled
 look and ragged appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich then shouted with glee:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're home! Can't you see? Two suns! Right there, up on the sky! Two suns,
 Amonas! We're here alright!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas turned to look at him slowly, almost indifferently, as if Hilderich
 had barely nudged him and asked for directions in the street.
 It was beginning to feel eerie to Hilderich, this behavior that was very
 much unlike Amonas.
 He behaved as if he was someone lost.
 Someone removed of identity, a hollowed out body, with barely a soul inside.
 They were home, Hilderich thought, and he was simply standing there looking
 back at him as if he had nothing better to do.
 He grabbed him by the arm and almost shook his entire body, as if Amonas
 offered little resistance.
 He looked him in the eye with an accusing stare and shouted in his face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're home! Like you wanted! Like we wanted from the start! This place is
 somewhere on our world! Why aren't you at least excited? What is the matter
 with you, Amonas? You're acting like, like..
 Like a stranger! Speak to me plainly!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas looked at Hilderich almost impassively with a look as if behind a
 fog, his mind seemingly wandering off to places without any connection
 to reality.
 It was as if he was in a dream haze, unable to wake up from a mystic slumber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Amonas! Don't look at me like that! Tell me, what is wrong with you! Don't
 you see, we're finally here!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amonas did not even flinch.
 He had actually remained quite motionless, his hands limp on his side,
 his face stuck in a slight grin, as if constantly mocking someone unseen.
 This could not be good, Hilderich thought.
 He shook him with both arms, trying to snap him out of whatever had enthralled
 him so.
 He shouted, cursed, he even slapped him twice, only once with some reserve.
 But it was all to no avail.
 It was as if the man's mind was gone.
 As if he was not there at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich realized with horror the truth of it.
 For some inexplicable reason, Amonas seemed to have lost his mind.
 It was there, carved upon his face.
 A glazed look, a deep blur set in at the center of his eyes, unmoving.
 His face had started to lose its color, and his mouth seemed locked in
 a half-smile.
 It was the face of an idiot unaware of everything going around him, lost
 in a sea of reality's debris none could hope to help him navigate.
 It was heart wrecking to see a man's mind lost in mere minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had it been the simply immeasurable vastness of the vista around them, this
 huge shaft that no mind could lay claim to even imagining it? Was it the
 sudden realization of having returned home in a most inexplicable, wondrous,
 and even uncanny fashion? Was it the combination of both? What had weakened
 his strong, determined mind? What had broken a man who was ready to give
 up his life for his unborn child, for a different, if not a better future?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an ineffable loss.
 They had seen marvels none had ever dreamt before and had taken most of
 them in their stride, their sanity intact.
 It was almost a laughable joke to think that Amonas would lose his mind
 at that moment, after all they had seen.
 And yet, here he was, a little more than a breathing mass, completely disassoci
ated with his surroundings.
 sank his spirits right when they should be laughing with all the heart
 or crying from the releases of such tension from so many days of hardship
 and uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich for a moment thought that it might have been better if Amonas
 had died somewhere along the way.
 He would have at least had his body and mind as one, his soul intact.
 Now, he looked as if his soul had departed and left an empty mind rule
 over a hapless body.
 It brought tears to Hilderich's eyes.
 But he held them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was mended before, when the voice spoke to them.
 There was proof that the ailing of the body could be treated with unsurpassed
 excellence and rapidity here.
 Or at least by something around here.
 That could also stand true for a sickness of the mind.
 For what was madness, catatonia, or whatever else that had befallen Amonas,
 other than a sickness of the mind.
 For every sickness, there is a cure, Hilderich thought, and his face brightened
 up a little, hope returning to his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed that their quest kept redefining itself.
 Now, he owed it to Amonas to make him whole again.
 And he should better start early.
 That meant he had to focus his mind, accept some harsh facts, and take
 the decisions that would lead them out of this very unfortunate situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took Amonas by the arm, as if he was about to with a small child, carefully
 and softly.
 He did not seem to respond in any way, his posture unchanging and his gaze
 fixed to a point beyond sight.
 Hilderich tried to pull him by the hand, and with a slight lurch and a
 small misstep, he began to walk behind him, as if he were a blind man being
 led around by a trusted friend.
 Half that much, Hilderich thought, was true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could be moved around then, Hilderich thought bitterly, as if he was
 a blind man, or indeed an invalid, a man with an empty mind.
 It all felt wrong to him.
 Seeing Amonas in such a state was almost devastating.
 If such a man could be brought so low without warning, whatever else could
 happen to lesser men, Hilderich thought.
 He hoped Amonas' mind was so far gone he at least did not perceive himself
 through Hilderich's eyes or had any sort of knowledge or awareness of what
 had befallen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If that was the case, Hilderich doubted Amonas could ever return to his
 normal self again, a tragically traumatic experience such as this one would
 be enough to break him by merely remembering it.
 He thought Amonas was a stronger man, in every aspect that really mattered
 in all this.
 If he was subject to such a downfall, then why not himself? For the first
 time in the past few days, real fear gripped him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not anxiety, not worry or wariness, but simple, pure fear.
 The piercing fear of someone's shadow behind your back.
 The fear of a man's knife, a howl into the night, thunder and lightning.
 Pure, primal, instinctive fear.
 He was alone, by himself.
 If he had been alone on that pyramid, if he had made it that far, he would
 have died with broken ribs, probably sun-burnt to death before anything
 else, if it wasn't for Amonas.
 And now, he had to repay that life debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suns were now shedding their light higher on the walls of the shaft,
 their bright spheres gone from Hilderich's sight.
 Now he had to address an issue that seemed to lack an easy solution.
 Where could one find food and water in this immensely vast space? He looked
 around him at the landscape stretching out in front of him.
 The floor was blue-gray and metallic.
 Various thin lines seemed to criss-cross it, as if forming a pattern.
 In fact he noticed that despite the immensity and the curved geometry of
 the walls, he could make out some shapes on the floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He let go of Amonas' arm for a while, and with a certain degree of trepidation
 made a few steps forward in order to examine such a curiosity.
 A relatively thick band of blue light seemed to seep through the floor.
 It went on and on, probably around the whole shaft.
 It was a very large blue circle them Hilderich thought.
 Giving little thought to the matter he stepped on it, and momentarily nothing
 seemed to happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then he felt a brush of air on the back of his neck, and turned around
 to see that the gate had been shut again.
 Not only that, but only a few feet in front of him, the floor started to
 ripple with intensity, turning into a molten pool of what looked like quicksilv
er or mercury, light flickering off with intensity, Hilderich's figure grotesque
ly reflected in a constantly shifting mirror surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stepped back instinctively, fear gripping him.
 Like the fear he had felt earlier, the fear of losing his mind like poor
 Amonas had.
 This was the same kind of fear, only much more aggravated, much more intense,
 and simply immediately in front of him.
 The pool of molten metal rose like a geyser of sorts, bulbous shapes taking
 over its surface.
 It grew as if a column of mud had been raised from the floor, only it was
 silver and mirror-like.
 Then it suddenly took form in mere moments, each step distinct but inhumanly
 quick.
 It was as if an invisible sculptor and an artisan were putting together
 a piece of work, something between a statue and a machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich could make out now the forming of metal upon metal, the joints
 between plates.
 Whatever this thing was, it's form seemed to derive little inspiration
 from the human body.
 It was shaping itself into an oblong, almost like an egg.
 In its final steps of transformation from a pool of metal into a much more
 tangible existence, it seemed as if an inner blue light faintly lit its
 top and bottom parts, a thin band of black opaque glass running through
 it, from top to bottom, as if it was about to split itself in half.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once it was finally formed, it hovered in the air right in front of Hilderich,
 barely touching the ground.
 The whole process was done in the time it would take a man to draw his
 sword in a misunderstood attempt at quite probably futile defense.
 Something that could appear out of a metal floor in such a place, was definitel
y not something you could kill with a sword.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then a terrifying sound assaulted Hilderich's senses, a terrible high-pitche
d screech that boomed and echoed like the primordial lightning storm that
 bore the universe and all of creation:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich tried put his hands to his ears but he was frozen half-way when
 the world-shattering cacophony ended abruptly and it's place took a buffeting
 silence, his ears still buzzing from the loudness.
 Then the metal egg, machine, whatever it was, bobbed slightly as if trying
 to mimic a human's bow.
 It spoke in a normal, pleasant voice, that seemed to be gibberish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich's brow furrowed and though his fear had somehow subsided, he was
 feeling terminally uneasy.
 Amonas was standing behind him, slack like before, the signs of a slight
 drool beginning to show on the corner of his mouth where his grin became
 lopsided.
 He looked with puzzlement at this construct, and could find nothing to
 say.
 It seemed to be unable to communicate with him.
 After a brief pause, the machine started spewing forth an uninterrupted
 series of sounds, like words, in rapid succession, as if it was searching
 a certain word, a certain sound, and tried many different ones.
 Hilderich couldn't be sure but perhaps it could be trying to communicate.
 At length he decided to try and say something.
 He thought the most apt thing to do, was greet it.
 And so he did, with some hesitation and a slight feeling of fear that he
 might be making a fool of himself to an invisible audience:

The construct bobbed again and wiggled its larger rounder base a little.
 The emotion that it intended to convey was completely lost to Hilderich.
 Nevertheless, he thought that actually communicating was wonderful indeed,
 so he didn't give it a second thought and smiled, somewhat restrained,
 but genuinely polite.

In only a few moments, in a fashion similar to the one before, the avatar
 turned from an egg into a multi-wheeled vehicle with a single seat, and
 what seemed to be a stretcher at the back.
 There appeared to be no controls.
 There was a sort of tent or awning as well, perhaps in order to offer some
 short of shade from the sunlight, but Hilderich thought it was quite superfluou
s.
 Though, Hilderich thought, transforming at will to any shape imaginable
 was certainly an ability that shunted necessities and favored whim and
 fancy above all.
 Perhaps he could ask, later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vehicle went to the side of Amonas, and gently carried him of his feet
 and onto the stretcher, all the while maintaining his posture.
 Even if he hadn't lost his mind and knew where he was standing at, Amonas
 would not have been troubled the least.
 Once he was put on the stretcher, the vehicle-avatar spoke to Hilderich:

And then they zipped off with an unprecedented feeling of acceleration,

 There was no other uncomfortable sensation, like the forceful rush of air

 Indeed, it was barely possible to notice they were moving with dazzling
 speed, and that only if one took very careful notice of the shaft above.
 Hilderich asked, sitting comfortably, quite pleasantly bewildered and not
 at all wary:

And the God visited upon the land he alone had wrought amidst the firmament
 of the stars.
 And he walked the plains, climbed the hills and swam in its rivers, he
 traversed the oceans and the clouds in a ship of great wonder.
 For a while, he was content to live among His people, teach me them all
 that he saw fit, in his infinite wisdom.
 He saw their prosperity, and he was pleased.
 The people thrived, and multiplied, and progressed.
 One day, they built the Forge of Stones, and offered it to God as a gift,
 a sign of their devotion.
 God was saddened, and His people asked him why that was, and He answered
 that they had need of him no more.
 And then God sailed on a ship of no sails, and left behind His people that
 called him Father

 break of dawn would be upon them soon.
 Violet ribbons of morning light dressed the cloudless sky with its desert
 clothes.
 The Pilgrim was knelt, bend over praying to God, his lips uttering mantras
 that thanked God for the gift of sight.
 Molo was right next to him, in studied silence, half kneeling in a praying
 stance.
 His features now were much more grizzled and harsher now than when he had
 left from his master's keep.
 He felt quite a different man, these days, and it showed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was not just that he was leaner, more muscle and thin skin than bone
 or fat.
 His body had become somewhat stringent, but it felt much more resilient,
 less drawn by earthly needs, more attuned with the realities of the surrounding
 world.
 It was the walk through the desert that was to blame, though Molo did not
 consider such change unwanted.
 Indeed, he felt it was a manifest blessing.
 A blessing from the God that he mocked, shunned and seen with his own eyes,
 felt on his bare skin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He believed now.
 Of all the things that he had imagined when he had set out, this was something
 quite unexpected, even laughably so.
 Still, it was indeed as the Pilgrim had put it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

God provides
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It provided him with a companion, with faith and truth, a guiding path,
 a light that shone each day and showed him the meaning of existence in
 a handful of sand and an patch of clear blue sky.
 It was the same God that had created this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had scolded himself for his previous feelings and thoughts.
 Faith, as he now saw in his enlightened mind, did not exclude logic, or
 slave men to a body of lies, a life of unhappiness and endless toil.
 It enhanced it, it magnified its significance, it gave men purpose, a hard
 background of impossibilities against which they could measure themselves
 and the world around them.
 It provided a challenge.
 Once God was proven to exist, what more was there to find out other than
 to see His true face, comprehend His plan, and follow its perfection to
 whatever end awaited each man? The Pilgrimage was the way to God's Land,
 as well as his heart and mind, the only way to talk to him and listen his
 voice resound through a man's soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had happened once already, even before they had reached the Garden of
 God.
 It was not a Necropolis, it could not be.
 The word was blasphemous, portraying God as something unliving, dead, withered,
 and gone.
 Perhaps God was gone, left for reasons he could fathom.
 But the echoes of his footsteps still roamed in His Land, each grain of
 sand carried his imprint.
 It was certain to him, clear as water from a spring.
 The touch of God was in everything, even in the storm that had seemed to
 spare them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that moment, Molo became a believer.
 He cast aside the hard grasp of logic and the lifted the barricades of
 his reason to let the shining light of true faith enter.
 He saw God, felt his presence, and accepted his truth.
 It was so very simple, if one walked in His Land.
 It changed a man, whether he wanted to or not.
 He did not believe there could exist a man or woman, born of flesh and
 capable of feeling, that would not be humbled by such a peregrination.
 Even himself, a man who had killed another man with a clear mind, without
 guilt or conscience, could be made to see God in this place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He ended his prayer with the sign of God, and the Pilgrim next to him was
 standing up, his feet planted in the still warm sand.
 Holding the guiding stone reverently, his body followed the stones guiding
 light, gazing the dunes that beckoned before them like rolling waves of
 sand frozen in time.
 But they moved, Molo had seen now.
 They moved with a speed that belied their size, their sand shifting slowly
 but endlessly with every tiny gust of air, like a trickle that never ceased
 to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was why it would be impossible to find one's way in the Land of God,
 without His touch guiding a man, without His help, without a stone.
 No landmarks whatsoever, nothing to measure distance by other than your
 own steps, that faded in the sand like when the sea washes over them with
 each wave.
 And those who did not have faith would certainly drift until their life
 was claimed, whether on sea or sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim then turned to Molo, and he pointed to him with a smile, letting
 his unusually healthy white pearly teeth shine brightly in the first rays
 of the suns.
 Molo smiled back and greeted him in High Helican, feeling warm inside for
 the first time in many years, perhaps for the first time since he was a
 child, before his master took him in.
 He said to the Pilgrim, in a clear, resounding voice:
\end_layout

The Pilgrim replied in kind:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo stood by the Pilgrim now, and asked him with more reverence than the
 Pilgrim saw fit for his person.
 It made him feel somewhat awkward, and a bit worried that his brother might
 be misjudging his people's ways.
 Molo's slight bow made him let out laugh deep and rumbling, like the sound
 of rocks tumbling down into a river.
 His brother's face was puzzled, but he seemed eager to learn of what he
 had said or done wrong, what had made him so unassumingly merry all of
 a sudden.
 At length, the Pilgrim felt the moment could serve well to enlighten his
 brother with some words of wisdom, seldom needed, but not unjustly so.
 He looked at Molo with the caring look of an older brother, and said to
 him under the light of the rising suns:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Tell, me brother.
 What is it that you seek in God's Land?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo seemed slightly put-off, as if taken aback from such a question.
 It troubled him, but he did not try to conceal it.
 It was a human gesture, admitting one's imperfection eagerly, without guilt,
 shame or regret.
 It was a good sign, the fact that his brother was now more open to him,
 almost transparent.
 Perhaps it was the test of faith that had turned his heart so much brighter.
 It had lit the fire of his faith anew.
 He himself had almost faltered in his quest.
 It was only understandable that his newly found brother would as well at
 some point.
 They were only human; it was expected of them.
 But God had supported them in their time of need.
 As always, God provides.
 As if trying to steer his mind away from a dark precipice, Molo was careful
 with his words, not only because the language was difficult to speak properly,
 but because he found it the Pilgrim's question deeply incisive, the answer
 yet not known to him.
 His voice was hushed and slow, while each word seemed to carry the weight
 of many different truths:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I seek God himself, brother.
 Though that would have been a lie a few days ago, it is now truth.
 In a way, I have always sought him, but only very recently did I have faith
 I would find him.
 Now I do, more than ever.
 It is comforting to know you were somehow right, even when you were wrong.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim raised a hand at that remark, looking at Molo with intensity
 and even wariness.
 He told him crisply, his words coming out harsh and unyielding, very much
 unlike his usual meek and irenic manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Man is always wrong, he is never right.
 His faith may be right, pure, unyielding, constant.
 But a man can never be right.

 These are the domains of man.
 Do not ever step lightly on one of God's domains.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was genuinely surprised.
 The Pilgrim had scolded him with ferocity, as if he had defiled something
 sacred.
 That was not Molo's intention, and he lowered his gaze, in silent acceptance
 of his transgression.
 He knew he still had a long way to go if he was ever to redeem himself.
 Thessurdijad Molo felt he had been born anew in that storm, but that also
 meant he had to learn how to walk, and talk, from the beginning.
 The Pilgrim went on, this time more mellow, more soft, understanding his
 brother would never transgress in such a way again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You have faith, brother, that much I know.
 But it is untempered, wild.
 It can lead you astray, in can be twisted while it yet remains unshaped.
 Pure and raw as it is, it can still be tainted, poisoned, turned against
 you and God.
 It has happened before.
 We are only men.
 We err.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo nodded at those words thoughtfully, but not simply because of the Pilgrim's
 candor.
 It was one of the first times he wasn't nodding simply because he meant
 to agree or accept the other man's words.
 This time he felt the weight behind the words, and he felt them squarely
 on his mind.
 The Pilgrim gave a small pause and then continued, in somewhat accented
 but still quite understandable High Helican:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will show you how to forge your faith into an unyielding armor, true and
 tried, a shield against His enemies.
 But I can only go so far as to warn you, steer you, advise you.
 God may be everywhere around us, but he is not alone.
 This world is tainted, and even in his Gardens we must be vigilant.
 The archenemies always seek to invade your mind, poison your soul, destroy
 your faith.
 Have faith brother, and empty your soul.
 Humble yourself, see the true path like before and let us walk on it hand
 in hand.
 God will provide.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim ended his small talk with a reassuring smile and clasped Molo's
 arm with his own.
 The Pilgrim looked at his brother, and felt the troubled that lay deep
 within him.
 He ached for his brother's troubles, but all he could do was stand by him,
 pray and wish for him to overcome whatever doubt and fear held his faith
 back, and turn the trickle of his soul into a torrent of faith and love,
 an unbridled force of nature, one that only God could spur in a man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo returned the smile, but only faintly, his mind focused on the deep
 thoughts the words of the Pilgrim had given birth to.
 It was just as well, to think about his past, his present and his future,
 all through the prism of the one truth that had been revealed to him to
 hold above others: God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He resolved that he would ask whatever came to mind, and he would tell whatever
 the Pilgrim wanted to ask.
 It seemed though, that the Pilgrim's questions would be enough, sharp as
 a tiger's claws, hard as rock and stone.
 For the first time in his journey, he wished he had more time before they
 reached their destination, more time to prepare himself, his soul, for
 what lay ahead.
 Because Molo now knew in his heart, that this journey could claim his soul
 as well as his life.
 It would be ironic to lose one's soul only a little while after he'd found
 out he had one to begin with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim began walking towards the point in the horizon the stone had
 shown earlier.
 He gestured for Molo to follow without another word.
 Molo seemed consternated, because they had been walking all night, again.
 The little water they found at times just before the dawn was barely enough
 to sustain them.
 It felt unwise, to continue without resting, exerting their bodies beyond
 their limits of tolerance which were already, quite enlarged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He did not voice his concern though, he knew it was not necessary, only
 wasteful.
 The Pilgrim motioned this time with even more vigor, bowing slightly and
 gesturing with both hands.
 For an instant Molo was reminded of an usher of festivities or a lordly
 servant, but such an image did not do the Pilgrim any justice.
 A few days ago, Molo would have mocked him in low Helican, but now he felt
 only ashamed he would have done such a thing to the man that had kept him
 alive, body and soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The suns had clearly come up now, casting their light across the dry landscape.
 The Pilgrim brought out his shelter stone touched it with both hands and
 a shadowy bubble seemed to shimmer around them for a while, before it turned
 completely transparent.
 It seemed to have lost some of its former capacity to shelter, like an
 awning suddenly becoming thinner, tattered.
 Whatever lay in God's plan, it seemed that this stone would rather sooner
 than later stop working properly.
 The heat was not scorching, but it was more intense than the day before,
 and the light that entered through the stone's invisible protective barrier
 was certainly brighter.
 Nevertheless, Molo started walking, trying not to fall behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wondered if the Pilgrim knew, though he was more concerned with how to
 broach this subject, lest it be considered blasphemy or an affront.
 Though he now believed, he also was not blind to the fact that these stones,
 though probably considered holy artifacts and for good reason, where technologi
cal marvels, not vessels of divinity.
 Highly evolved technology could be easily misunderstood for a divine miracle,
 a work of God.
 Molo felt he could help these people understand their past, and they could
 help him shape his future.
 'God willing', he added to his thoughts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had been walking over thick sand for the better part of an hour, every
 one of their steps sinking visibly up to their ankles, slowing their pace
 considerably, sapping their strength with every passing minute.
 The creatures of the rats that had sustained them were gone now; this was
 no-man's land, a veritable patch of dead send.
 Yet, God lived here.
 The realization of that contradiction led to a strange flux of feelings
 in Molo; he felt calm, at place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But at the same time there was anxiety in his heart, wariness, a feeling
 of lurking danger.
 It could be the feeling the Pilgrim had warned him about.
 It could be some primeval sort of warning emanating deep from within.
 It could all just be the effects of wearing down his body, having walked
 constantly for half a day or more, with just a couple of mouthfuls of water
 and not a single bite of food.
 He felt he had to ask the Pilgrim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pilgrim, I'm feeling weary, tired.
 Shouldn't we stop and rest? If only for a little while.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim did not stop, neither did he slow down.
 He simply carried on, using his walking stick to help him propel himself
 forward, as if it was a row in the sand.
 He did not turn to look at Molo, but rather replied in a crisp, somewhat
 stringent voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There will be no rest from now on, brother.
 The stone has served its purpose diligently for many years.
 It will soon cease to be of any use.
 We must make haste, take advantage of as much of its protection as it still
 lasts.
 So we walk.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'So he does know the stone is failing', Molo thought.
 He then felt it would not be inappropriate to ask more of the Pilgrim,
 the strain from the arduous walking evident in his voice, gasps of breath
 between his questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Does that happen with every stone? Are they not very precious to you? Is

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim brought a hand up, a gesture that implied Molo should be silent.
 His hand briefly occluded the two suns, offering Molo a small patch of
 shadow so he could look at the Pilgrim with more ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Molo went silent for a few moments, and lowered his head, trudging behind
 the Pilgrim who seemed to be little more than inconvenienced by the difficult
 terrain.
 He still seemed troubled though and voiced his concern, of a different
 nature this time:
\end_layout

The Pilgrim stopped in his tracks then, but did not turn around to look

 He simply glanced sideways when he told him:

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim resumed his walking pace, his feet kicking up the sand with
 an ease that belied the fact that it was a feat in itself.
 He graced Molo though with an answer, in a loud, knowing voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, they both returned to a silence that seemed to be so natural
 in the desert, the only sound the continued murmur of grains of sand shifting
 and turning, swirling in the air, an eternal dance to the whims of the
 wind.
 Molo could only nod in mute acceptance, and walk behind the Pilgrim, the
 sound of his feet sinking in the desert sand, keeping pace with the beats
 of his heart.
 The suns were on the rise, soon it would be noon.
 All around them, he could see nothing but sand.
 'God will provide', he muttered under his breath, and trudged along.

Dusk was only a few hours away.
 Molo was exhausted, every muscle aching but the ones in his legs simply
 burned with searing pain.
 It was impossible for him to go any further without resting first.
 Molo thought the Pilgrim would resort to actually dragging him in the desert,
 but that had remained only a thing in Molo's fantasy.
 They had stopped for the day, the heat of the desert slowly diminishing,
 its echoes still faint in the evening breeze, a warm wind that could have
 been almost pleasant if it did not carry any sand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were resting in the shadow of a tall white obelisk, otherwise unadorned,
 plain, demanding attention by its sheer size and apparent uniqueness, dominatin
g the desert landscape.
 They had first seen it when the suns were high up above, at midday, a gray-blue
 silhouette in the horizon.
 It had taken them until before dusk to finally reach it.
 It was a tall obelisk with a wide base, and on its one of its four sides
 the gleaming glossy white material it was mostly made of seemed to be peppered
 with tiny little holes, as if it was porous and sponge-like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could not know for certain, but though indeed impressive, the obelisk
 did not seem monumental, indeed awe inspiring.
 It felt more like a building, or a post, something long abandoned even
 though it was in perfect shape apparently.
 It did not seem as it had been erected, but rather like it had always been
 there, heedless of the sandy winds and scorching heat.
 The Pilgrim had stood aghast when he saw it, and in reverent tones started
 reciting from memory, his only source of knowledge:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Molo had repeatedly asked whether or not this was what they were looking
 for, whether or not their journey drew closer to an end, but the Pilgrim
 had simply told him that he would see for himself, if he was indeed humble
 and faithful.
 That had quietened Molo down, who felt the excitement was perniciously
 keeping him out of focus, making his thoughts and hopes stray from the
 one true path he was now walking, the path of God.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps indeed the archenemies were lurking around, their malignancy somehow
 trying to veer him away from his newly found purpose, driving him to dark
 corners of his mind he did not wish to revisit.
 Perhaps, it was simply himself, still trying to come to terms with his
 new identity as a believer, not an avaricious atavist, a cold-blooded killer,
 a man seeking to empower himself with unsurpassed might and hidden knowledge,
 whatever the cost.
 That was the kind of man Molo had known.
 His new self, he had to learn as he went.

The shade of the white pristine obelisk was comfortable enough for them
 to sit down, and perhaps sleep in the still warm sand, using it as a sort
 of blanket.
 What was even more refreshing was the water the obelisk produced, a small
 recess in its base readily appearing as if a lever had been pulled, with
 an unnerving lack of sound.
 It had been done with a simple touch of the Pilgrim, as if he had been
 here many times before and quite intimately the workings of such a thing.
 When questioned about that, the Pilgrim had merely shrugged and said to
 Molo, 'God always provides'.
 It was an unanswered mystery that could very well remain so, if it meant
 fresh, cool, potable water would be readily available here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they were sitting at the base of the obelisk, their eyes would not leave
 it alone.
 The Pilgrim was offering a reverent gaze to it, seemingly musing the workings
 of God in His Land, engrossed in thought and prayer.
 Molo's visage was that of a man preoccupied with troubling sensations and
 feelings of unease.
 True enough, the obelisk had saved them from dehydration and death, and
 even though food was still unavailable, and their progress seemed to be
 slower, water was more important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what really raced in his mind was the opportune moments.
 The storm clearing away from them harmlessly instead of leaving their bones
 to bleach under the suns.
 Finding the obelisk right about when the desert was surely going to claim
 them.
 Was it really God that provided, or was there more to such blissful and
 timely divine providence? Molo felt unsure and uneasy, the latter due in
 part to the former.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Esphalon came to his mind, since he had mentioned divine providence as well.
 Was it a common theme? Was the desert and its extreme environment the one
 to blame for the changes he was going through? Was it a trick of perception,
 a misstep of the mind? Was it simply a coping mechanism? The array of questions
 that seemed to come unbidden to his weary mind suddenly became overwhelming.
 He had to give pause, rest, clear his mind, and then search within and
 without to find his answers.
 Maybe, as the Pilgrim had told him, the burden lay on him.
 It was time he had some sleep then.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He made the sign of God right before the hour of dusk signaled its approach,
 coloring the thin line between the land and the sky with a violet shade
 of crimson and a deep blue like the ocean sea.
 He knelt and prayed, the newly found solace in that simple act soothing
 his troubled mind.
 The Pilgrim next to him did likewise, and right before Molo laid himself
 down, curling with only his cloak to cover him up, he talked to him affording
 him a preciously warm and friendly look:

Molo looked away from the Pilgrim, into the setting suns that grazed the
 dunes afar with the last light of the day, two glowing rings of brightness
 worn around the shadow of the low dunes.
 He took his time before answering, but when his reply came it rang true,
 crystal clear and genuine:

I think that is the real reason, yes.

The Pilgrim spoke no more, and silently closed his eyes, and laid himself
 down to sleep, the lukewarm sand's embrace his body's only comfort.
 Molo felt enthusiasm try and take hold of his sense and his mind, but he
 thought of the Pilgrim's words, and his advice.
 He looked once more into the fading horizon and noticed the moon ready
 to rise once more, reign over the desert like a pale queen of the night.
 He let his feelings of enthusiasm go, and he tried to empty his mind.
 It would all be revealed in time, he could trust in that.
 He then slept, his body welcoming the absolute stillness.
 He had hoped for dreams that would guide him, but none came.

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim woke him up with a jolt to his sides, and a tug at his vest.
 It felt abrupt and violent, but it seemed, the Pilgrim had good reason.
 Before Molo could stand up on his feet, he could see in the still darkness
 of the night the moonlight casting their hard shadows against the sand.
 The Pilgrim had a finger to his mouth, instructing Molo to remain silent.
 He even noticed he was holding his breath in an effort to not make a sound.
 He felt they were in danger now, and the Pilgrim's attitude only served
 to strengthen that belief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Something was amiss around them.
 The Pilgrim had felt it first and was now trying to uncover it.
 A sense of hidden menace hung in the air, as if night itself had suddenly
 turned against them.
 They exchanged wary looks and the Pilgrim extended his arms to help Molo
 up to his feet, his movements exuding a strangely purposeful grace, as
 if he was moving with an entirely new purpose now.
 Indeed, once Molo was standing upright, the Pilgrim gestured him to stay
 put with the palm of his hand and silently drove off into the night towards
 a small mound of sand that seemed to block their view to the north.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was barefooted and he moved impossibly fast, with the grace of a cat.
 The Pilgrim barely touched the sand, his feet almost failing to impress
 themselves on the desert floor.
 He had drawn his knife and was grasping it with his right hand, his torso
 somewhat swiveled, ready to deliver a forceful blow, his body ready to
 spring in action, putting as much of his weight and strength behind it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo had frozen in place, and tried to gather his wits and his senses.
 He could not know what had alerted the Pilgrim, but its presence was felt
 from Molo as well.
 They were in danger, that much was clear.
 He suddenly felt naked, without even a simple weapon in hand.
 He saw the Pilgrim had left his walking stick behind, a sturdy piece of
 wood, gnarled and light.
 Judging that a piece of wood would offer better protection than his bare
 hands, Molo picked it up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He walked as silently as possible, much more slowly than the Pilgrim, his
 feet sinking in the sand effortlessly.
 Molo tried to wield the piece of wood like a staff, holding it with both
 hands, but he saw its length was badly suited to such a task, so he grasped
 it with both hands from one end, like a club.
 The Pilgrim was approaching the top of the sandy mound, and reduced his
 stature to a bent shape, his pace to a crawl.
 He appeared to Molo as a cougar or a mountain lion, ready to spring up
 on its prey with vicious speed and cold fury, only because of lethal necessity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was so very much unlike him to act in such a way.
 It was as if a heathen warrior of old myth and folk tales had come into
 life before him.
 Perhaps it was so, perhaps these myths had their origins in the people
 of the Pilgrim, the believers of God.
 Molo had never thought of him in such a light, judging him to be a serene,
 mellow man, a sensitive mind in a frail body.
 It seemed that some people hid more than met the eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he himself approached the crouching figure of the Pilgrim, he saw him
 turn and look at him with an exasperated look, probably because he was
 making too much noise in an otherwise eerily silent desert.
 He gestured Molo once more to be silent and still.
 Molo complied, understanding that it was unwise of him to go running after
 the Pilgrim, heedless of the noise he was making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A smell of iron and sparks permeated the air suddenly, wafting over the
 crest of the mound.
 It was not very much unlike the smell often found in blacksmith shops and
 forges, though its exact nature eluded him.
 It was sharper, more acrid, it almost felt like it stung the eyes.
 It was not a good sign, it felt wrong and unnatural.
 His body tensed and the Pilgrim seemed to be on the edge as well, the fingers
 of his hand opening and closing in rapid succession around the knife's
 haft in nervous anticipation.
 The air thickened with alarming speed, the smell grew stronger and then
 he saw it appear over the crest, strangely thin beams of light sprouting
 from what might have been a head of sorts: a glistening metal hulk glinted
 in the moonlight, uniformly gray and unassumingly blocky, a rectangle slab
 larger than a man.
 The Pilgrim saw it too and sprung up like a coiled snake, his hand making
 a large slashing motion at the metal slab delivering a glancing blow and
 then rolling back down the slope of the mount, tumbling and coming to rest
 at what seemed like a safer distance from the metal slab.
 He was a few feet away from Molo when he shouted, all reasons for silence
 and discretion gone, his stare focused on the metal slab slowly coming
 their way, improbably keeping itself floating half a foot above the sand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was confused, though his feet and legs moved like they had ears of
 their own.
 A floating slab of gray metal had appeared in the middle of the night,
 out of nowhere, and the Pilgrim had attacked it to no avail with his knife.
 And now, they were running.
 At least, he was.
 Running towards the obelisk, with the Pilgrim left behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim wasn't running, he was hefting the knife from one hand to the
 other, as if looking for a sturdier grip, a better fighting stance.
 He looked at his face and all he saw was calm acceptance, a knowledgeable
 expression in his face, as if he was ready body and mind for what would
 follow soon.
 He did not see defiance or strength of spirit.
 He saw a man who felt his end was near, but was determined to make it count,
 somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molo was almost halfway to the obelisk, when the realization struck him:
 What logic lay there in reaching the obelisk? What reason was there to
 run and pray, while the Pilgrim made a last stand that felt so vacant and
 void of meaning?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped suddenly then, and started running towards the Pilgrim and the
 coming metal fiend.
 As he ran with as much speed as the sand at his feet allowed him, he grasped
 the stick with both hands, ready to swing it around as hard as possible.
 He could not leave the Pilgrim alone in this.
 Molo asked himself what use were a knife and a stick against a floating
 slab of metal.
 If it had come to kill them, it was better that they died together, fighting
 as if they could someday win.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim saw him with a corner of his eye rushing to meet the slab.
 It seemed to Molo that he opened his mouth to say something, his eyes flashing
 red with anger.
 All the while, the slab had come within reach of the Pilgrim.
 As Molo swung the Pilgrim's stick putting all the speed of his body behind
 the blow, he could see the Pilgrim's knife shattering on impact, and a
 black band of glass in the middle of the slab.
 An instant later a red flicker of light filled his sight and his feet seemed
 to disobey him.
 Everything went dark and mute, as all sensation fled his body.
 His last thoughts were that death is nothing to be afraid of.

Major Guighan relayed the General's order to the signal's officer with a
 nod and a gesture of his hand.
 The signal officer then communicated it with his hands to a soldier who
 held two colored flags.
 The soldier began waving the flags in a certain pattern repeatedly.
 In the far distance, where the siege engine battalion was arrayed, an answering
 wave of flags could be seen shortly thereafter.
 The signal had been acknowledged.
 A few moments later, a single red flag was raised in answer, and held there.
 The signals officer attached to the General gave a nod, and the flag-bearer
 raised another, similar red flag.
 Major Guighan reported to Tyrpledge:
\end_layout

Sir, the siege engines report readiness.

 men.

The General was looking at the City of Pyr with a strange mixture of intensity
 and sadness.
 He was standing upright, tensed on the back of his horse, which lay unmoving,
 steadfastly following its riders commands, like a valued trained warhorse
 should.
 The sight filled the General with grim determination.
 The plans had been laid out, his brigadiers had been notified and each
 one had received orders, acknowledging the receipt.
 Everything seemed to be progressing in a professional manner.
 For the most part the General's mind was preoccupied with the situation
 in general, not simply the battle that was soon to follow.
 A small part though was still focused on matters that had to be dealt there
 and then, such as receiving reports and issuing the right orders.
 That part of his mind answered to the Major, a flat, blatantly emotionless
 voice:

Major Guighan saluted and walked briskly to the signals officer to construct
 a suitable message.
 The General seemed to survey the assemblage of men, horses and machine
 laid out around the City of Pyr, but in truth his vision was a blur and
 his mind was engrossed in thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There would be no misunderstandings and confusion before battle was joined.
 The placements of each brigade of his men around the City could be easily
 regarded from the small hill the General had chosen as his headquarters.
 Major Guighan had proposed the specific site, and Tyrpledge was pleased
 to see that his adjutant was an adroit tactician, equally skillful on the
 map as well as the field.
 At least, until now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General's had embarked on a journey of reminiscence with his mind.
 The smell of a battlefield was brought up from memory.
 The smell of blood and decaying bodies.
 There was no such thing as the smell of victory and defeat, they both were
 foul to the senses.
 In the end, it had always smelled sweetly sick and coppery.
 Like a feast gone horrible wrong, a feast for Gods that hunger for life.
 He smirked, unbidden thoughts that reminded him of bad poetry and idle
 philosophers trying to cloud his mind before a battle.
 He was a soldier, he had his orders and his oaths to follow, unto death
 if the need came.
 That was a soldier's life, dying a violent death, hoping some good came
 out of it.
 What good would come out of this though, the General could scarcely imagine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had seen quite a bit of action in the Pacification of Zaelin, a recently
 promoted centarch at that time.
 It had been his first and last taste of bloody battle, until now.
 He did not relish this second chance at smelling death once again though.
 War had always had little to do with reason, but somehow it always made
 sense before battle was joined.
 Duty, honor, valor, one of those always appeared in one form or another,
 demanding to be the focus of every fighting man.
 He found honor and valor to have nothing to do with this battle which could
 easily turn into a slaughter.
 And duty could be facing either way.
 The men inside the city felt they had a duty as well.
 Were they entirely wrong to uphold that duty?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He found himself questioning his actions once more.
 But he had never questioned his allegiance.
 It was simply the images of unwanted carnage which would soon take place
 that filled him with regret and remorse.
 Such feelings though were reserved for another time, after the battle would
 end.
 Whether it would be won or lost actually mattered little.
 Blood would be spilled, the blood of fellow men, innocent women and children,
 for that much was certain: No one escapes the wrath of war.
 Some are simply caught in its path, and pay the price for a mindless, uncaring
 fate.
\end_layout

Major Guighan waved with his hand in the air, circling a finger.
 The signals officer stood erect with both hands outstretched.
 An array of flag-bearers raised their black flags and soon the dull thuds
 of huge ropes snapping and the metal clicks and clacks of springs and plates
 being released reached the General's ears from an uncanny distance.
 Flaming barrels of oil and tar seemed to spread over the city like a death-embl
azoned fiery fan, while large rocks and steely spiked balls converged on
 a single section of the walls, falling down upon them like a hail of doom.

The Patriarch was dressed in resplendent fashion, red velvet robes adorned
 with finely-cut jewels, glistening brightly in various hues under the bright
 light of the suns.
 It was the time before noon, both him and Ursempyre standing atop the eastern
 tower of the Disciplinarium, the horizon filled with the daunting sight
 of the massed armies of the Outer Territories, waging war against the city
 of Pyr.
 The siege engines had commenced their work against the city walls, and
 already large chunks of the seemingly unyielding walls had been cleared
 off them, debris filling the deep moat that had been hurriedly dug the
 very same morning behind the section under attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch stood in the middle of the tower, with a magnifying glass
 to his eye, surveying the battle.
 Squads of procrastinators stood behind masses of men of all ages, forced
 to wield whatever weapon could be found around the city forges and blacksmith
 shops.
 The armory of the disciplinarium had been depleted as well, the procrastinators
 being issued the finest available armor and weapons, while the city folk
 pressed into service had been given whatever could be scrounged in the
 last minute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was folly for anyone among them to believe that this hurriedly assembled
 militia could withstand a determined assault from the experienced, well-trained
 and artfully equipped armies of General Tyrpledge.
 The Patriarch beamed at the thought, and gave a momentary sideways look
 to Ursempyre standing a few feet away, an elite guard of procrastinator
 veterans standing between them.
 Ursempyre returned the gaze with a venomous look, but resignation was evident
 in his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He hated the Patriarch with all his heart, but he hated himself even more
 for failing to do everything in his power to avert this damnable catastrophe
 unfolding before his eyes.
 He had resigned and nothing short of the shackles on his feet prevented
 him from falling over the parapet of the tower to a well-deserved though
 ignominious death.
 The Patriarch had forced these upon him when Ursempyre's first attempt
 from the balcony below had failed, prevented by the Patriarch's awesome
 powers, stunned and unable to even flicker an eyelid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had been scolded playfully like a troublesome child, and was now being
 tormented, forced to witness his people slay each other in a staged battle,
 as the wicked stage-play the Patriarch written was about to unfold.
 Everything was fake, everything was a lie, except for the blood that would
 soil the ground, and seep through every stone in the city.
 Ursempyre was denied even the release of death, such was the malevolence
 and evil of the Patriarch.
 An affront to life itself.
 His thoughts made Ursempyre physically sick, and he vomited despite himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patriarch noticed and let out a derisive snort, full of mockery, the
 pleasure derived from Ursempyre's utterly broken figure lacing every word:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ursempyre spat, trying to clear his mouth.
 He felt though that nothing could wash away the bitterness inside, the
 foul lies and deceit the Patriarch sowed with his every word an almost
 tangible pool of bile.
 He felt unclean, soiled by the fiendish being's mere physical presence.
 He might have been broken and resigned of hope but there was no meaning
 for him to indulge the Patriarch's sick sense of humor.
 He did not answer, indeed decided he would not answer the Patriarch's goads.
 He simply stared at him through eyes blackened with rage and sorrow, the
 skin underneath sagging from lack of sleep.
 The Patriarch had stopped observing the movement of the armies.
 At length, he started pacing around the tower, his guards standing like
 unblinking statues at strict attention, as if they were oblivious to what
 was transpiring, or simply did not care.
 He seemed to be enjoying the cool wind this high up, breathing deeply,
 a grin forming on his face.
 He addressed Ursempyre, sparing him only a small flick of the wrist towards
 him:

The only sounds reaching them were the intermittent thrashing sounds of
 rock flung against the walls, mingled with the tumultuous and disarrayed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The koma bird is known to lay its eggs on the highest mountains, precariously
 perched on the roughest and deepest of precipices.
 Once the eggs are hatched, the parents feed the newborns for only two days.
 I have not seen it for myself, but I have confirmed the veracity of such
 reports.
 When the hatchlings have been fed, their parents drop them all, one by
 one, to either learn to fly or perish in their forced effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naturally, most fail to do so.
 Only perhaps one in ten do so, and most komas lay eggs only twice or three
 times in their lives.
 As a consequence, they are quite few and far between, their numbers constantly
 low.
 They are large birds though, their wings span as large as a dozen feet.
 They're excellent fliers, able to soar the skies as high as the clouds
 sometimes, swoop down with lightning speed to feed.

 Always flying, Ursempyre.

 To which I would reply 'This is not victory, this is a prelude to the real
 fun.
 Didn't you like my story? Was it not educational? It's actually a parable
 where I am the koma father and all you ant-like people are the little birds
 and I'm killing you off one by one to see which one will be able to fly'.

That was sort of the dialogue I had in mind.
 Though of course I only made up the story now.
 There are no such things as koma birds.
 Such a species would be dead within three or four generations at best.
 Your spite seems to have diminished to the point of simply gazing venomously,
 hoping some sort of lightning or other divine instrument of will smites
 me dead where I stand.
 Regrettably, that is not going to happen.

Ursempyre stirred somewhat, unable though to move his feet shackled as they
 were.
 He made a motion with his body towards the Patriarch, and raised his hands
 as if trying to grasp him by the throat.
 However naive and futile it may have seemed, he dearly wished to kill that
 thing.
 Instead he asked with a raspy voice, his blood-shot eyes radiating maddening
 hopelessness, a saturnine look on his distraught face:

Will kill me now, blessed one? Or let me kill myself? Have you no hope or
 fear left in this world or any other that you chose me and my people as
 playthings? What womb of evil bore you, still I wonder.
 Hell is so much warmer than your heart, I'd wager.
 Such a cruel fate as mine I would not wish upon no other as you.
 Curse you Patriarch, I curse your very soul.
 I believe in no God, I have all the proof I'll ever need.
 All hope is lost, my mind and spirit broken, my people dying by a brother's
 blade.
 But this I swear to you, chosen of the Gods: Your end will be far worse
 than mine, remember that in your dying throes.
 The higher you stand, the harder the fall.
 Remember that, Patriarch.
 Remember Ursempyre Remis.

The Patriarch's eyes seemed to glaze for a moment, before suddenly becoming
 clear again, the faint cracks of a grin slowly appearing on the Patriarch
 face.
 He seemed to relish the fact that Ursempyre had bitten back an answer,
 even if it was only a curse.
 He bit his lip faintly, as if pondering which words were to follow from
 a bustling cloud of possibilities.
 His grin turned into a wide cold smile when he said with a degree of cynical
 mirth:

And he never surrenders, I'll remember.
 That is so much more like you Ursempyre, bitterly defiant to the very end.
 As well as a soothsayer, a man gifted with visions of the future.
 I am almost impressed.
 The fact that I already know I'm going to die someday does take away some
 of the points in your favor, but I'm glad you tried to make me laugh.
 I would pity you but it's so much more satisfactory to watch you go these
 mood swings.
 Broken puppet the one minute, fiery rebellious martyr the next.
 Do you think anyone is watching, Ursempyre? Do you think anyone would genuinely
 care about what is happening here? These are the end days of Pyr, my Castigator.
 Breath deeply, let the charcoal gristle on your skin and smell the copper
 heavy in the air.
 That's blood and fire for you, Ursempyre.
 My sermon of blood and fire.

Ursempyre's stare remained on the Patriarch, deeply seated hate emanating
 from his eyes.
 He lowered his trembling arms and sagged his shoulders, speaking in a dim

 surrounding the city and the mayhem caused by the fires, sprouting like
 incandescent blossoms:

You wish to bless us with your interminable wisdom as well? A parting gift

 Do you see yourself as attending to your flock? How committed! As their
 dying breath leaves them, your guidance will surely be remembered and praised
 when they reach the righteous heaven they await.
 And they will never know only nothingness awaits.
 Is that what you seek, a charnel of souls chanting your name in an afterlife
 that does not exist?

The Patriarch's response was to laugh heartily and come closer to Ursempyre,
 his hands knead together in front of his stomach, the guards making way
 in his path.
 He spoke then, his voice emanating menace, as if blood stained his tongue
 and venom coursed his veins:

You balance on a tight rope, Lord Castigator Remis.
 Do not speak of the afterlife so vainly.
 What would you know about something you so feverishly avoid? Something
 that reeks of the death you people so stridently shy away from, and never
 grasp or understand.
 I've died and been reborn a thousand times, and yet another thousand more
 I shall.
 It is a circle, that's all there is.
 Even stars collide and die in terrific splendor, while others silently
 ebb away and vanish as if they never were.
 Yet their light reaches everywhere, Ursempyre.
 Would you know what a star's death feels like, Remis? I know.
 I've seen with bare blinded eyes.
 I've watched world consumed in dying flames.
 I've witnessed billions spill their blood willingly on a whim of mine.
 And you would dare insinuate, before my very presence indeed, that my sermon
 is a charade, a mockery designed bring you low.
 Do you think so highly of yourselves? And you call me a blasphemer and
 an affront.
 How petulantly ironic.
 But only understandable.
 Though if I were you, I would have kept my mouth and ears shut, unable
 to fathom or understand a single moment of the numbing madness around me.
 In that respect, I can almost admire you.
 But, you test my limits, Ursempyre.
 And I do have limits that only vary rarely reach.
 Perhaps it's the real reason I'm keeping you alive.
 A sort of challenge.
 A test.

Ursempyre had heard enough to believe it might be an opportunity to goad
 the Patriarch into killing him outright, save himself from further torture,
 excruciating aggravation and utter disgrace.
 He spat on the Patriarch with fury, a large blob of spit splashing against
 his features and slowly running down the creases of his leathery face.
 The Patriarch did not even flinch, and said in a deadpan voice:

He turned to one of his guards and made a sort of hand signal.

I'm not a lesser man Ursempyre, and I will not hold this against you.

 I shall speak soon to the mass of people remaining in the city.
 I shall spur them onwards to a great struggle against the treacherous blaspheme

 yelling our names, thinking how righteous their deaths will be.

The Patriarch finished wiping his face, threw the handkerchief, and walked

 a glimpse of the handkerchief.
 He noticed then it had a curious dedication delicately hand-stitched on
 it:

Faint light entered the quarters they had sequestered for her and her newborn
 child.
 It was not so much a room as it was a crevice, a hollowed out cavity of
 rock somewhere underneath the city, just another small cave forming part
 of a complex network, whose size she could only guess.
 Her mind wandered to such meandering thoughts whenever Amonas came to mind.
 Their child was here, in her bosom, being fed for the first time.
 Where was the father? Where was her love?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An instant later her eyes locked with the tiny sparkling things that were
 her baby's eyes, the crystal blue water of the oceans staring back at her.
 She could almost hear the gurgling of virgin waterfalls in his small cries
 and throaty sounds.
 The boy was a painful reminder of his father, even from the way he stretched
 when he fell asleep kindly, craning his neck before it settled cosily on
 her chest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was only born the night before, in a damp cave full of strident men,
 their endless, mirthless cacophony silenced by the sudden and unexpected
 cries of a child gasping for air and a mother suffering the pains of labor.
 They had turned and looked with astonishment, their croaks and hawkish,
 almost unintelligible cries choked in concert, replaced with whispers of
 amazement and gasps of wonder at such an event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two men had been very kind and helpful to her, mindful of her dignity
 as a lady.
 A doctor was among the crowd of kinsfolk, and he alone was allowed to attend
 to her, some more men offering to hold their cloaks and form a screen for
 her to give birth in something that could almost equal a privacy of sorts
 under the unfortunate and inappropriately timed circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had given birth then and there, amongst the company of complete strangers,
 but somehow the feeling in her heart was that she was among family indeed,
 something more than friends.
 The kinsfolk seemed to embrace her the minute they saw her distress and
 need.
 After her labor, all that remained of the pain was a numb memory.
 Her heart soared as high as the suns when she laid her eyes upon her son
 for the first time, and she wept from joy.
 Only after the doctor asked of the boy's father, did she shed tears of
 sorrow.

\begin_layout Standard
The men in the large underground chamber had been in constant fruitless
 debate only minutes before, but the sight of a woman seeking refuge and
 help stirred them to action and concordance.
 In her matter, there were no voices in disarray, no arduous discussions
 with no end.
 They offered their help and assistance immediately, as if she were to them
 a sister, a wife, or mother to them all.
 Some sent for nursemaids to attend to her and see to the child.
 Others pulled their cloaks and stripped themselves of their clothes to
 make something soft for her to lay on, as well as sheets to feel warm in
 the dampness of the cave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They all seemed eager to help in any way they could.
 The birth had seemed to offer some sort of rest from their incessant deliberati
ons that had seemed to lead to nowhere in particular, far from an agreement.
 She was not told the details, but she was told they had been trying to
 decide what their next action would be.
 As far as she knew laying in her makeshift cot, cradling her baby in his
 serene sleep, they had yet to reconvene and decide, while all at the same
 time a young girl that cared for her told her the army had begun the attack
 on the walls of Pyr only minutes ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And still these people waited on their hands, knowing not what to do.
 The thought painted her face with a bitter grimace.
 What good would it do them, hiding in these caves wishing everything that
 caused them trouble would simply go away? Was this the kinsfolk indeed?
 Were these people ready to give their lives at the flick of an eye, in
 a moment's notice, for a bright future free of tyranny and lies?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She found it hard to believe.
 Perhaps they were indeed good men through and through, but this reluctance
 to commit openly to battle, however grim and dark their chance be, was
 almost cowardice.
 She did not wish to dwell on that thought any longer though; she would
 only be remembered of Amonas and the pain inside would only make her cry
 like a poor lost soul.
 She still had an obligation to her child, and she intended to keep it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the child woke up, and she regained some of her strength, she would
 ask to see their leader, ask to talk to him, stir him into action.
 That was the first and most simple thing that she could do.
 Make them fight as they should.
 Terror filled her when she thought they just might give up, simple-minded
 fear taking over them, begging for their lives to no avail.
 She hoped that would not come to pass, for then that would mean that her
 son's life was forfeit along with everyone else's in these caves as well
 as those hiding all over the city above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The child seemed to stir slightly, as if his sleep was troubled.
 Her brow furrowed at the thought that perhaps he was already sensing there
 was something wrong with the world he had been delivered into: it was harsh,
 demanding, and uncaring.
 Perhaps he could sense the absence of his father's touch.
 She certainly did so, and felt a twinge in her heart as she saw a shadow
 touch the screen to her chamber.
 Her heart skipped a beat hoping it was him, that it was Amonas who had
 at last come back to them both.
 But her mind told her otherwise, and soon her eyes proved her heart wrong
 once more.

\begin_layout Standard
The shadow belonged to the young girl that had been called to tend to her.
 She had brought her a small basket of food, and a jug of water.
 She looked up at the young girl who was eying her sheepishly, afraid to
 make eye contact, as if she were some noble woman or a priestess of some
 sort.
 She had hair like amber fire and held a small lantern, letting off just
 enough to let her find her way in the dark maze of caverns all around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The girl approached Celia with hesitation, and left the small basket of
 food at her feet where she lay.
 From what Celia could see there was some honey-bread in the basket, some
 goat's milk and boiled eggs as well, a small feast indeed under the circumstanc
es.
 Perhaps they had brought some supplies down with them, or had stashed some
 from beforehand, in case of an emergency.
 Still, they were being deprived of food that would be surely needed sooner
 or later.
 It only meant these were indeed good men, caring people.

The girl intoned her last words with a wide mouth and careful precision,

 She asked the girl:

 Her body showed signs of fear and anxiety, a slight tremble and an uneasy

 Celia moved her body closer to peer at the girl, all the while rocking
 her son gently in her lap.
 The girl had opened her mouth but no words came out.
 Celia thought the girl perhaps was younger than she looked, or maybe taller
 than she should be.
 She then asked the red haired girl with a disarming smile:

The girl nodded uneasily and sat down in front of Celia, folding her legs

 Once she settled herself down and wriggled a bit, at length she spoke,
 a half-smile trying to sweeten her face:

The last phrase was uttered in complete sincerity without a hint of irony

 When the thought went away, she motioned for the girl to come closer, which

 She then slowly and carefully extended her lap, holding the boy in her
 arms as if they were a cradle.
 She nodded to Neelis, who did not seem to understand, and then she said:

The expression on the Neelis' face turned from a restrained bewilderment
 to pure joy and a bright smile lit her face as if another lantern had suddenly
 appeared.
 With careful movements, as if she was about to handle the most precious
 thing in her life so far, she took Celia's son and held him firmly against
 her chest, one arm supporting the baby, and the other wrapped around as
 if guarding it from certain harm.
 Her mouth seemed stuck, only half open.
 Celia told her as she felt the pains of exhaustion course through her body

 It was as if her gaze was impossible to pry away from the newly born child,

Neelis nodded and picked up her lantern, lighting the way for Celia.
 She had been quite dizzy and disoriented from labor when they brought her
 in, and she had given only a passing amount of attention to the sprawling
 system of caves that seemed to branch out in many different directions.
 Small chambers of sorts were arrayed almost randomly, some natural and
 some seemingly carved out by men, the signs of chisel and pickax still
 easily spotted, still not eroded by time.
 Some seemed to be occupied by men and women, others seemed to house families,
 small and large, children trying to play hide and seek in the dimly lit
 passages that had become their impromptu playground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no central passage or hallway to speak of, though some of the
 corridors were larger, and she could see men walking past going about some
 business or duty, some carrying supplies like food and clothes, some even
 carting weapons and armor.
 Each face she saw as she walked about the underground home of the kinsfolk
 was filled with tension, uneasiness, doubt.
 Even in the dim light of a lantern and a few sparingly situated torches,
 it was not difficult for someone to spot the tell-tale signs, especially
 for someone like Celia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After all she was a dancer, experienced and trained to read people's expressions
, understand their feeling and react to them through her performance.
 The feeling came unbidden, but she felt a small sense of loss.
 She almost missed her dancing days.
 Everything looked brighter in her memory of those days.
 Perhaps it really was, but it might also have been the grim darkness that
 surrounded them, not just the one in the caves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thing that struck her as odd was the way people looked at her in
 passing.
 Some did not even register her presence, but others turned and went wide-eyed
 with surprise, some pointed and whispered, and some even made movements
 of obeisance, like bowing and nodding reverently.
 No one seemed inclined to stop and ask her what was on their minds, even
 though it was more than certain that she had somehow managed to become
 some sort of popular person.
 It must have been the dramatic circumstance under which these people came
 to know her, crying and shouting in the agony of labor, blood pouring out
 of her guts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neelis barely talked though she did seem to turn around and look at Celia
 and the baby many times.
 She also went about the passages, corridors and the larger cavities were
 hallways met with astounding ease, considering the poor light and lack
 of distinguishing features in such a landscape of wild irregularity and
 stony uniformity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keeping track of time without sunlight was an almost impossible task.
 In these caves, only faint distant echoes of water dripping down from some
 parts of the rocky ceiling could remind someone of time passing by, the
 sloshing sound of each drop on the cave floor like the tick of a clock.
 Still, it was impossible to keep count.
 Celia did not know exactly for how long they had been walking, but her
 legs, feet and back knew.
 Strained from the labor, she felt her energy was drained from the relatively
 long walk.
 It felt as if she had walked a small tour of Pyr itself.
 She thought that might not be that far from the truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she was about to ask Neelis how much more they had to walk, the girl
 stopped short of a small corridor that led to a somewhat brightly lit cavity.
 Flickers of light danced about the entrance, as a large torch cast its
 light to the otherwise dark hollowed out space that seemed to connect many
 corridors and passages.
 Neelis turned and bowed slightly, almost in a curtsy, and pointed to Celia
 the entrance with a slight nod.
 She said:

\begin_layout Standard
Neelis seemed to have heartened to Celia and the boy in the little time
 she had known her.
 She smiled broadly then, only like a child truly can, and ran away waving
 a parting hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia entered the brightly lit corridor, always firmly holding her son in
 her arms with some apprehension, a mother's instinct that would not be
 appeased no matter what.
 In front of her she saw a small chamber filled with candlelight, their
 scent more than enough to break the smell of cold damp rock that sometimes
 reminded her of an outhouse.
 Another thing that caught her attention was the sound of jingling bells
 and chimes of some sort, as if someone had forgotten a child's wind toy
 over an open window, making a strange sort of music as its pieces swirled
 by the breeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The small cave was irregularly shaped in an angular way, the bookcases and
 an old study massed together near the corner of the angled rock, while
 a somewhat larger space to the right of the study, a sort of crevice, housed
 a small cot and even a cupboard of seemingly antiquated wood.
 A wizened old man seemed hunched over an over-sized book, while around
 him an assort of various books, scrolls and maps lay strewn around at random,
 candles aflame in precarious positions with or without holders, hot wax
 dribbling down profusely.
 The man was wearing a simple garment like robes, brown and soiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It reminded her of a minister's surplice but this man's clothing bore no
 resemblance to anything of such pristine delicacy.
 He had not registered her presence, though indeed she had not spoken a
 word nor had she announced herself when she entered the corridor.
 She also saw the source of the strange jingling sounds; the old man was
 wearing a jester's hat, wisps of grizzled gray hair jutting out from underneath.
 He otherwise looked quite solemn, his hands tracing the pages of the book
 he was engrossed with.
 At length, she decided it was time to speak.
 At that exact time, her son woke up from his sleep crying loudly in her
 arms, and she instinctively tried to simply shush him to sleep again to
 no avail, no matter how gently she rocked him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old man turned to look at her with a startle.
 His brow furrowed with annoyance momentarily but then a hint of recognition
 appeared on his face.
 His voice was high in pitch, but sweetly grazed by time, lilting and musical,
 the voice of someone with a gift for storytelling:

Well now! What is my condition? Is it any graver than the rest of your people's

\begin_layout Standard
She realized she was almost screaming now, her anger getting the best of
 her, while the child in her arms seemed at least as aggravated as she was,
 his cries continuing unabated.
 The old man sighed and nodded, understanding he had offended Celia somehow.
 He then talked to her earnestly, in a clear-cut, straight manner, his tone
 of voice curt, precise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celia's face was withdrawn, not even the hint of a smile adorning her features.
 The girl was right this man reeked of strange tidings and unfamiliar manners.
 He was strange without ever letting one understand why, she was sure.
 All the while her son would not stop crying, the old man's voice straining
 to raise itself above the child's.
 Her silence was his cue to continue:

Anyway, you've come to see me, so I guess you asked for little Neelis to

Celia simply stood there, looking at the old man in disbelief.
 He then lifted his hat slightly as if to greet her, and with a trick of
 the hand seemed to produce a baby's rattle which the newly born boy could
 not even hope to grasp yet, but its sound seemed to calm him, his cries
 settling down as if magic had put him in a trance, eyes open and alarmed,
 only the sound of his breathing to be heard.
 Feeling her slightly distrustful, almost wary, he made an effort to lighten
 the palpable uneasiness between them and said with a wide grin:

The cilliarch in charge of the Thorax battalion was on horseback, running
 up and down behind the line of his men, repeatedly shouting orders for
 them to advance with cohesion and order.
 His breastplate was polished to a mirror sheen, reflecting wildly the terrible
 forms of his men, clad in their huge plate armor, living unyielding hulks
 of metal.
 A few hundred feet separated them from the walls of Pyr now, and they where
 already under attack from the few defenders manning the walls, sparsely
 throwing arrows against them to no real effect.
 They were advancing slowly, but steadily, sacrificing speed for protection
 and the ability to withstand most attacks against them with impunity.

The man known as Castigator Olorius Menamon the IV was dressed in his most
 resplendent war gear, the very same he had worn on the day of Zaelin's
 pacification, the last time he had gone to war, the last time he had seen
 bloody combat.
 He seemed engrossed in thought, as if musing vaguely rather than thinking
 about any specifics for the battle at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General Tyrpledge was riding his warhorse, wearing a common light bronze
 cuirass above his uniform, only his rank insignia making it look any different
 than the common light swordsman.
 The General seemed nevertheless in a shape and form that belied his years
 of service.
 He was surveying the battlefield with bare eyes, his attention fixed on
 the selected breach site of the walls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an uncommonly hot day for that time of the year, barely a cloud in
 the sky, the light of the suns falling upon spear, sword and armor alike.
 It made them shine with blinding force, turning the field of battle into
 a shimmering sea of metal and men.
 The General thought this could almost have passed for some ridiculously
 extravagant parade, though it was not meant to be one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would turn bloody soon enough, and he could only hope deep inside him
 that somehow this would all end quickly and painlessly, his duty accomplished,
 and his people broken.
 A rebuilding would be needed, but perhaps that could spur some innovation,
 a much needed air of change.
 He could almost understand the feelings of the rebels: stagnancy often
 leads to death, as had the battlefields proven throughout the course of
 history.
 Tyrpledge still debated with himself though, whose deaths would it lead
 to in the end?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator stood impassively on his own mount, his sight intently set
 on the far reach of the city, on the Disciplinarium itself.
 His eyes looked glazed, and it was as if he hoped to burn holes on the
 city walls by his sight alone.
 He seemed then for a moment to breathe in the air roughly, sniffing it
 audibly, as if searching for a specific scent or perhaps simply enjoying
 the breeze's more tangible qualities: burnt wood and ash from the city
 caught in a blaze, the brushings of steel from sharpened weapons, the slick
 oil of polished, well-maintained armor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly, as if the question had been withheld for too long, the Castigator
 turned his head and asked Tyrpledge:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Why haven't they surrendered, General?Hmm?What makes them hope to live the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tyrpledge was somehow caught by surprise at the Castigator's questions.
 It was an incisive, straightforward question, very much unlike the Castigator
 who had hardly spoken since the march to Pyr.
 He had been quite reclusive, appearing only to stir the army into upholding
 their oaths and taking up arms against their fellow men.
 The act of committing the amassed forces of the Outer Territories to quench
 an uprising in the making did not leave everyone's mind as yet another
 order.
 The atmosphere was tense, surely, and everyone felt the heaviness of these
 moments, from the brigadier general to the lowly soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator's question still remained unanswered.
 The General believed it better to leave it at that.
 The motives and thoughts of the traitorous rebels should be left to their
 own.
 The only thing that mattered was that they were violating Law, and duty
 called for him to stop them.
 That was where his concerns on the issues of the uprising started, and
 that was where they stopped.
 He suspected many things which he thought would be extremely unwise to
 voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps this was what the Castigator was trying to do; lure him into treacherous
 terrain, bring him into a vulnerable position, sense if he was still committed.
 A dangerously cunning man.
 Perhaps he had already entered in a complex scheme of machinations that
 would make the mind numb if they were to be revealed.
 It was just as well, he cared not about such things.
 He trusted his mentor's motto: Avoid politics, at any cost, because it
 could cost you your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator's face was wearing a knowing grin, when he asked the General
 with a mocking tone, as if there was a competition going on between them
 and the General seemed to be losing it:

\begin_layout Standard
The General remained calm at the face of an attitude bordering the ridiculous,
 intent only to aggravate him and test his limits as a person and an officer,
 for reasons that probably the Castigator found pertinent.
 Instead of indignantly falling so low as to disgrace himself in the middle
 of an ongoing battle, he simply waved his adjutant to come closer.

Major Guighan came crisply by his side and saluted with unfeigned vigor,
 standing to attention.

\begin_layout Standard
Major Guighan exchanged a quick glance of apprehension with Tyrpledge, but
 quickly resumed his professional tone and stance.
 In the background, large blocks of stones were starting to chip off the
 walls, and the smoke from the fires spreading throughout the city was getting
 thicker by the hour.
 He responded with a nod and a salute before adding:
\end_layout

Of course, sir.
 Initial reports based on informants within the Ministry and the Disciplinarium
 seem to agree that for an unfathomable reason the Patriarch ordered that
 the Arch-minister be purged of his office, as well as denouncing his piousness
 the Castigator a traitor ex absentia.
 Indeed the Noble Representative Lord Ursempyre Remis has been appointed
 and blessed as the new Castigator by the Patriarch in a formal ceremony.
 The most helpful piece of information comes from a trickle of fleeing civilians
 that seemed to have fought with their lives to escape Pyr.
 It seems that the Patriarch has been forcing men of all ages to take arms
 against our forces.
 A campaign of terror is under way to force submission to roaming squads
 of procrastinators whose sole mission is to prevent anyone from leaving
 the city as well as press-ganging them into service.
 Physical violence, the use of families as hostages as well as public executions
 are already in effect from the forces of the Patriarch.
 There are also unconfirmed reports of a cluster of people taking up arms
 around the city with no clear allegiance or purpose.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Castigator tried not to show it, but he looked impressed at the quality
 and thoroughness of the information, as well as in the crisp, clean manner
 it was delivered.
 Tyrpledge on the other hand did not hide it at all and had been nodding
 briskly all throughout the Major's report.
 He then urged him to continue with a nod in his direction, seeing that
 he had been waiting for a signal to conclude his briefing, his brief pause
 a thematic element in his speech:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The order of battle is as follows, sir: The two Thorax battalions are attached
 to the main bulk of the infantry leading the assault, laid out in a thin
 double line of troops forming the absolute front line.
 The swordsmen, spear-men and bowmen of the are marching right behind the
 Thorax in that exact descending order, holding standard line formations,
 keeping their distances from each according to specific orders to each
 commanding brigadier.
 Orders were also issued to prefer men with no relatives in the City of
 Pyr, so as to limit the possibility of men facing morale issues during
 battle.
 Once the siege engines manage to breach the walls, the steamers will rush
 forward through the formations of men which will split in two to make way
 for the machines.
 The steamers will create a safe bridgehead for the swordsmen and pike-men
 to follow close behind, while the bowmen will harass any enemy within their
 range to provide additional cover to the assault force which will proceed
 to clear the city of enemy resistance, house by house, street by street,
 with the objective being to create a safe corridor to the Disciplinarium
 as well as the Patriarch and the Castigator themselves.
 The specific part of the walls to assault was made based on the proximity
 to the Disciplinarium, which would hopeful keep casualties among the citizenry
 as low as possible, and lead to a quick and decisive victory.
 The logic behind such a strategy, which is corroborated by our confirmed
 information, is that should these two prominent figures be neutralized,
 any amount of effective resistance will cease to be.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Major was done, he stood to attention once more and saluted crisply.
 The Castigator nodded, reminding the General of what could only impossibly
 be a disgruntled but impressed man.
 The Major had been, as usual, excellent in his appointed task.
 While the siege engines continued their slow barrage of fire and stone,
 and every battalion maneuvered continually so as not to disclose the final
 position of the assault, the General's mind turned inward again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General was thinking with a heavy heart about the trapping of such a
 civil war.
 If it came to a fight between brothers or father and son, who could blame
 one for turning against his fellow soldiers, or idly staying his hand costing
 him his life at the hands of men less sentimental.
 Battle was no place for the soft of heart, it only spared those with a
 mind empty of doubt, bearing cold steel in their hearts as well as their
 hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had taken on a serenely morose look.
 He had known this would not be an easy fight to carry through, but he had
 not anticipated it would feel this ugly.
 Perhaps in the end, he could not avoid the politics of a troubled conscience
 that was about to add more lives to its blood toll.
 His thoughts were broken and his senses became the focus of total attention
 from his mind: A booming voice seemed to echo from the city of Pyr itself,
 as if the air above it had been turned into a giant cone of voice, radiating
 words for everyone to here.
 It seemed impossible that it could be so, though everyone seemed to stop
 in his tracks as if he had been rooted there.
 Instead, everyone had been transfixed by the voice of the Patriarch, which
 sounded as clear as when enunciating the holy words of Law from the Ministry's
 tower.
 What he was now saying though, sounded totally different, his voice abrasive
 beyond human measure, as if razors sharpened against coarse stone:

When the unearthly voice had spoken and its echoes had died out, intense
 light seemed to blossom from the center of the city, as if a small sun
 had been brought down and was struggling to find its place among the skies
 again.
 Behind the glaring blaze of light, the Disciplinarium could be seen, rising
 above the rest of the city, and below it, nothing but huge tongues of flames.
 As the Disciplinarium rose along with most of the hill, everyone's heads
 turned to face it, marvel it, wonder at what they were seeing.
 Not a word could be heard, the only moments ago bustling battlefield entombed
 in silence.
 Only a brooding, deeply rumbling sound like stones carrying the echoes
 of thunder could be heard, and it could only come from the ascending mass
 of the Disciplinarium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly, the huge blue and white flames flickered on and off before finally
 dying.
 A moment passed where everything seemed to remain still.
 The Disciplinarium was about to meet the ground it had so majestically
 parted with only moments ago.
 And everyone cowered before the falling shadow of the Disciplinarium, as
 if it was coming down on their own heads.

 of light flickered on and off casting monstrous shadows on the sleek gray
 metal floor, huge sparks flying from unfathomable machinery hard at work,
 showering the improbably high walls with fiery fragments.
 Light was at a premium, its sources the by-products of the industrious
 machines: sparks like lightning, hot rivers of metal, red and yellow cutting
 fires and blue-hot flames, green and violet beams of light against stark
 gray metals, the mirror sheens of gleaming new surfaces reflecting everything,
 multiplying their intensity in a maze of light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an organized mayhem, the machines scattered around as if giants had
 sown them from wildly thrown seeds.
 Some of them seemed to be no larger than Hilderich himself, neatly arrayed
 in rows upon rows on the floor, as if they were awaiting inspection.
 Others towered over them, the size of a small hill or an impossibly high
 castle tower.
 Some were dim and seemed to be inert, others glowed or crackled with fiery
 lights and eldritch sparks, booming and thudding sounds emanating from
 within, some of them humming in unnatural tones.
 To Hilderich, it felt like the machines in this place ate metal and drank
 fire, their breaths not unlike deep rumbling rivers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invariably, everything zipped past Hilderich's sight with a speed that left
 little chance for him to marvel them leisurely.
 The Prosops had been ferrying them silently but efficiently through the
 maze that the seemingly randomly placed machinery created around them.
 Sometimes a path would construct itself right in front of them as the wheels
 of the vehicle-avatar ate away at the gray sleek shiny floor surface, to
 guide them around or over obstacles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They would travel at speeds where the flustering air would make Hilderich's
 eyes blurry and watery, causing him to squint.
 At other times, long overarching narrow rails would make themselves available
 and the machine would jump over them in a carefree fashion and ride them,
 while hundreds of feet below the floor could not be seen, blackness and
 ruin awaiting them should they fall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow though, Hilderich felt untouchable, safe in the care of the Prosops,
 the Centron itself.
 It stood to reason that if any danger lurked around this place, it was
 not the vehicle-machine's erratic but expert maneuvering skills, but rather
 something less obvious and well-hidden, something that had yet to manifest.
 Though feeling safe at the moment, Hilderich kept a watchful eye on his
 surroundings, just in case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He peered beyond his immediate surroundings, beyond the towering grapples
 and unfathomable pillars that crackled amber lightning.
 In the distance, streams of pure white and blue seemed to pour down from
 the pitch dark ceiling high above, lost in many places where the eyes could
 not follow, behind metal behemoths and mazes of pipes and tubes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Immense skeletal structures that reminded Hilderich of upturned boats or
 very strange looking ships were being worked on, fleets of smaller and
 bigger machines not very much unlike the Prosops buzzing around them like
 flies around oxen.
 The sounds and sights in this place reminded him of a playground made for
 giants, or a shipyard like no other, the pride and envy of every artisan
 and craftsman.
 What would have driven any minister mad from sheer shock, would certainly
 burn with a bright gleam of wonder in the eyes of the renowned smithies
 from Repentine, and the proud ship-makers of Ulrathi, if they ever saw
 what he could see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The air seemed somehow thick, as if it was filled with by-products from
 the profoundly industrious machinery around them.
 Monstrously huge shiny claws and arms seemed to move and lift improbable
 loads with surprising ease, other smaller machines flitted like metal birds
 while overhead a lattice of glass tubes that could fit a foaming river
 inside them seemed to emit pulses of intense light.
 The number and workings of the machine were unknown, but Hilderich could
 only suppose it numbered in the tens of thousands, a legion of machines
 and devices of origin and purpose unknown.
\end_layout

Hilderich raised his voice well above its usual tones, trying to make sure

The machine swooped down a small ramp that moments before was not there
 and was now steering them down a wide spiraling road that seemed to corkscrew
 around a tower whose top seemed to be perpetually devoured by the darkness
 of the ceiling, dim stripes of red light running along its length, the
 base of the tower barely visible below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was staring wide-eyed, mesmerized in awe of the immense space
 filled with all sorts of strange and mystifying buildings and constructs,
 his mind overloaded from awe, wonder, and amazement, his senses failing
 to capture faithfully the incredible nature of the Den.
 It felt to him as if an immense stage had been wrought for his pleasure
 alone, designed to woe and subdue him utterly, a tale of fantasy to entrap
 him, body and mind.
 He almost felt it wouldn't be half-bad if that was indeed so, as long as
 his captors would let him watch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He couldn't make out any workers at all, everything on the giant workshop
 floor of the Den seemed to be running, moving and working on its own.
 Hilderich thought that such a sight would cause every minister in the Territori
es to die from shock or drive him instantly insane exposed to such blasphemy
 against the Pantheon.
 Machines acting on their own, their powers unleashed unsupervised, free
 to reign over matter; a hideous thought it would have seemed but it right
 there in front of him.
 Hilderich queried the Prosops about the lack of personnel in the Den, and
 people in general to which the machine answered with a slight bob and a
 tone of surprise:

\begin_layout Standard
It sounded as if the machine had let out a small chuckle as it ended his
 phrase, but Hilderich felt one could never be sure of the capricious machine.
 He frowned deeply, a feeling of alarm and intense distaste washing over
 him, but restrained his voice from revealing how flustered he felt:

Sentient people doing menial work? That would be absurd.
 Are you familiar with that kind of thing in your world? It must be a really

 I'm kind of surprised you happened to be invited to a game, actually.
 You must be from some kind of feudal empire, I'd wager.
 So I guess you're made for life back where you come from - a seriously
 big hotshot.
 Right? Am I right? I know I'm right, you just have 'winner' written all
 over.
 Maybe you're a prince, or an important xenologist.
 An ambassador? Don't tell, don't tell me I'll figure it out.
 Just tell me when I'm spot on.

Hilderich instinctively turned his eyes upward trying to perceive what the
 machine had meant, but was quick to realize it was impossible for him to
 see what the comment was about without a mirror.
 He also felt uncomfortable being reminded he was using deception to further
 their goals, he almost cynically realized he would be a fool if he did
 not make the best use of what luck threw in their way.
 If the Centron thought they were visitors, and indeed spectators to a game,
 people from an entirely different world altogether, then he'd act the part
 as convincingly as he could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other worlds, other people, different civilizations and societies.
 His mind was still quite ineffectually trying to cope with the implications
 the Centron imparted.
 With no real reason to believe the Centron could be lying after everything
 he had seen and been through, Hilderich could hardly contain himself from
 grinning at the expectations these revelations had given birth to.
 No longer would they need to cage their minds in ignorance and fear.
 There were places to see and explore, new things to learn and do.
 Perhaps he could somehow persuade the Centron to help them in such a quest.
 But that would have to wait.
 Amonas was his top priority right now, he felt he owed him as much.
 Besides, his predicament seemed to be just cause for leading them to very
 interesting places, perhaps even the very heart of this Centron.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops considered Hilderich and Amonas as visitors to the Centron,
 spectators for the 'game', but it had also indicated its invariably hostile
 demeanor against trespassers, the 'loony bins' as he had called them, people
 that seemed to stray inside the Centron at inopportune times, though not
 completely random as it had pointed out.
 It had also made a note that they offered a sort of diversion from its
 tedious duties, by 'mushing them with g-pulse fluctuators'.
 Hilderich thought that whatever these fluctuators were, being used to turn
 people to mush was enough to mentally note them as avoidable at all costs.
 They also served as a bitter reminder that though visitors were allowed,
 trespassers were less than unwanted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were now evidently slowing down, the road became wider and less steep,
 and in moments they had reached the base of the tower, a wide porch of
 white porcelain arrayed before them, fine granite marble semi-circular
 steps leading to an arched gate that seemed to lead further into the tower.
 It was an eerily familiar sight, the whole entrance resembling a ministry's
 doorsteps.
 All around them the work continued incessantly, the cacophony of noises
 and the ever-shifting lights a constant reminder of that fact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops laid down Amonas in the same manner that had lifted him up on
 its stretcher-like surface, floating him in mid-air covered in a dim blue
 glow, a slight haze all around him.
 It politely asked Hilderich to get up from his seat, and in a series of
 mechanical transformations and shimmering bulbous transmutations, it reshaped
 itself into its egg-like shape, which Hilderich found less disconcerting
 now, a thought that slightly troubled him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being able to look freely at Amonas again now that he wasn't confined in
 a seat, Hilderich took a good look at him: he seemed perfectly fine, as
 if he were slumbering in the most serene way imaginable.
 In a sense, perhaps Amonas was indeed sleeping.
 A pang of fear gripped Hilderich's heart at the thought of Amonas never
 waking up again, but it passed quickly.
 In this maze of wonders where every step brought with it unimaginable marvels,
 surely even such a strange affliction as the one that had struck Amonas
 so suddenly could be treated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops made a sound as if clearing a throat that could not possibly
 exist for its intended reason and spoke in a mockingly formal manner.
 The inclination of his body led Hilderich to believe it was trying to mimic
 a haughty, stiff manservant of a noble.
 It said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

If you would be so kind, master Hilderich allow me to show you and your
 stasis-paralyzed friend to the Game Room.
 Don't forget to wipe your feet first.
 Wouldn't want you getting dog poop in there now.
 Just had the place meticulously cleaned by handmaidens and you do know
 how hard they are to come by.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops bobbed frantically for a moment, as if nodding wildly seeking
 approval or acknowledgement, the red light in the black band in its middle
 moving up and down erratically.
 Hilderich looked unable to follow the meaning behind the machine's blank
 expression.
 As he simply frowned slightly and proceeded towards the arched gate, the
 machine seemed to be grudgingly trudging along behind Hilderich, with Amonas
 body somehow in tow, with no chain or rope between them, hovering a few
 inches above the granite floor.
 Its voice sounded disheartened, almost morose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Come on, hand maidens, hard to come.
 Get it? Didn't think you would.

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops shone a green beam of light onto the door, and not a moment
 later, it started to grind itself open, squealing and making stressful
 noises.
 The process proved to be laborious and quite inefficient, unlike almost
 everything else around the Centron.
 Hilderich thought about that momentarily and made a mental note to inquire
 about that when it would seem appropriate.
 As if the machine could read his mind, something that Hilderich could by
 now safely know to be wrong, it told him by its own volition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know, I know the door sucks and I should get it replaced or fixed, but
 I can't do that, no no.
 It would, and I quote - 'ruin the authenticity of the original setting'.
 Don't look at me, I know it's silly, but they're pretty touchy with those
 things.
 As I said, I just keep the place running.
 Now, after you.

\begin_layout Standard
The machine ushered Hilderich inside with a gentle swaying of its mass,
 a bob and the black band of glass-like material filled with a regal blue
 glow.
 Hilderich nodded in acknowledgement, despite the silly pomp and ceremony
 of the Prosops.
 Perhaps it indeed was necessary, and Hilderich thought that it would not
 be of any help if he were to really upset someone by breaching protocol,
 if indeed such a worry could exist in the Centron, of all places.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gates had opened to a bottleneck corridor, wide at the entrance and
 narrow at its end, where a dimly lit chamber could be seen, a slightly
 green and yellow light emanating from within, but few other details were
 visible from the distance.
 The corridor was luxuriously decorated with exquisitely carved wooden panels,
 of many different techniques and woods, depicting strange scenes that he
 failed to identify from his knowledge in history, myth and lore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The floor seemed to be made of the same granite as the doorsteps outside,
 though was tiled, alternating between lighter and darker shades of red.
 Hilderich felt curiously intrigued by the improbably styled interior of
 the tower, though it troubled him that the atmosphere this place exuded
 was not akin to a place of healing.
 Suspicion bloomed inside him, but he took a first step towards the chamber
 nonetheless.

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops shrieked in horror:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich froze in place, the sudden screech making his hair stand up.
 He stopped dead in his tracks, and slowly turned around to look at the
 Prosops with a frown, a mix of horror and puzzlement in his face.
 The egg-shaped machine bobbed and leaned slightly forward, its black band
 adorned with a single red dot of light, it's voice low with faint undertones
 of mirth:

\begin_layout Standard
Exasperation did not suit Hilderich's face well but it was contorted in
 such a way as to exhibit it profoundly.
 He still found it difficult to understand how eccentric a machine of such
 awesome power could be, resolving to ignore most of what it said from then
 onwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He walked down the corridor indeed with a visitors pace, slowly, deliberately.
 Hilderich felt his unwanted role to be almost enjoyable.
 He was intently staring at the intricate designs on the walls, trying to
 decipher the scenes they depicted.
 It was not because he felt his role demanded it so, but because his interest
 was genuinely piqued.
 A vague sense of importance seemed to radiate from these walls.
 A moment passed while Hilderich thought it strange that despite everything
 that he had seen so far, nothing seemed to have caught his stare in such
 a profound way.
 He paused in his stride while the Prosops seemed to follow silently, Amonas
 carried along behind him.
 At length, he asked the machine:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

These etchings, these carvings..

The Prosops grumbled discontentedly something inaudible before passing in
 front of Hilderich, leading the way now instead of following.
 It added resentfully:

Hilderich withheld a more inflammatory retort and simply said:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

The machine did so, while Hilderich followed from behind.
 A quick glance at Amonas unnerved him, the man's face serene as if it had
 surrendered to death, but brightly and vividly colored as if blood flowed
 hot in his veins still.
 He could not know the manner in which such a contradiction was achieved,
 and only hoped Amonas was indeed alive, and he had not been deceived by
 the capricious machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long corridor ended in a resplendently adorned entrance to a well-lit
 chamber that seemed to resemble a richly decorated study, complete with
 bookcases and screens.
 A plush red and green carpet seemed to add a certain air of decorum to
 the room, which seemed to emit a certain air of gravitas, possibly more
 than Hilderich found tasteful.
 It was octagonal in shape, each side playing host to an assortment of bookcases
 and screens, filled with seemingly pristine books of various sizes, accompanied
 by many objects that were possibly more than mere decorations.
 Everything was neatly arranged and the room was purposefully designed with
 elegance and style, a feel for the finer things in life.
 Velvet could be found in many surfaces, as well as glistening marble, bronze,
 gold and copper in fine casings and perfect symmetry of space.
 It was the room of a noble connoisseur, a man of wealth and taste.
 It felt completely out of place in the Centron, and the slightly bobbing
 form of the Prosops inside struck Hilderich as almost vulgar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich could not believe he had not seen it the moment he stepped inside,
 indeed he cursed himself silently for not seeing it as he had walked down
 the length of the corridor.
 From the roof of the large room hang a large metal assemblage, angular
 and bulky, almost orthogonal in shape.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever it was, it had almost definitely been placed in this room as an
 afterthought, as no sane person would knowingly add such a monstrosity
 to a carefully arranged interior environment.
 However long Hilderich stared at it in utter disbelief and profound distaste,
 words would not come from his gaping mouth and the atrocious piece of metal
 would not go away.
 The Prosops said with a knowledgeable tone of voice that somehow also managed
 to express ennui, its languid movements undoubtedly adding to that effect:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich indulged the machine, taking a couple of steps back absent-mindedly
 while at the same time his head was turned upwards, a hard stare fixed
 on the unbelievably ugly and misplaced metal object, which seemed to be
 the size of a large wardrobe or closet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within moments, the large bulk of metal started to lower itself in rapid
 fluid motion, coming to rest on the carpet.
 It was indeed roughly shaped like a large wardrobe, its rough metal surface
 a matte drab olive green.
 Large tubes and fat strands of what looked like colored rope to Hilderich
 seemed to protrude from its very top, while a low humming noise was faintly
 audible.
 The Prosops tugged Amonas behind him with some sluggishness, as if it were
 reluctant to do so.
 It flicked a beam of light at the closet, and suddenly a door large enough
 for a man of almost any size to stand upright slid open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich was transfixed to where he stood, his gaze wandering around the
 closet, the open door and the Prosops.
 A primal fear roused him to reality with a jolt, bringing him back to his
 senses.
 He realized cold sweat was running down his back and forehead, while at
 the same time he shouted at the machine which was lifting Amonas upright:
\end_layout

The Prosops lifted itself slightly upward before slowly turning its black
 band to face Hilderich.
 Though it had little in the way of communicating sentiment and feeling
 and lacked a facial expression, the flatly lit red thick line in the middle
 of the black band felt to Hilderich almost as if it wanted to burn through
 him with enjoyable deliberation.
 The stiffness of the machine's movements somehow struck him as portraying
 extreme exasperation, a feeling which was indeed verified when the machine
 spoke, tones of outright annoyance in its vaguely male voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm trying to fix him.
 Even though I don't really have to.
 Do you want me to just hold him in mid air till the game's through? I could
 do that.
 I could also dance to a tune if you'd like.
 I could just sit there and tell you I'm doing it too fast for the eye to
 see.
 Would you want me to do that, Master Hilderich?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He thought the machine was genuinely frustrated by now, something that he
 would have never thought possible of a machine, but it was rather apparent
 that it was largely dissatisfied and had lost its good humor, quite possible
 a long time ago.
 Hilderich was reluctant to demand more of the machine right at that time,
 but he felt he had to ask, even though he might not understand.
 He did so politely, trying to appease the machine's brooding mood, his
 voice trimmed and clipped to something an ambassador would use to convey
 assurance and calm:

 never met such a charismatic personality such as yours.
 It has been an adventure so far at the Centron and it's no small wonder
 that it's all under your control.
 I would be utterly grateful if you would be so kind as to offer your expert
 assistance to my friend right there.
 I would also be honored I you could explain some of the delicate techniques

\begin_layout Standard
The Prosops bobbed slightly, leaning to and fro as well, as if intrigued,
 curiously undecided about what it should say.
 The red dot of light that flitted on its black glass-like band had turned
 into a blurry glow.
 One could even surmise the machine was trying to look blushed.
 Despite the unhappy circumstances and their precarious situation, Hilderich
 barely managed to suppress an oncoming fit of giggling.
 He was looking at the machine with a feigned look of worried expectation,
 when it answered with a sparkling quality in its voice:

Amonas then moved in the air, his body still enclosed in the same strange
 aura as it had been before while being ferried to this place.
 The machine assumed a more formal voice with an intense feeling of feigned
 stiffness behind it, intended to portray extreme seriousness, though to
 Hilderich's ears it only managed to make it sound like a dimwitted inflated
 egotist:

Hilderich face was creased from concern.
 He had no idea what the machine was talking about, but it seemed to at
 least seem to know what it was doing.
 He was now standing closer to the metallic closet, the immersion tank as
 the Prosops had called it.
 The rigidly held upright body of Amonas was expressionless, frigid in more
 than one way.
 Hilderich felt somehow it would be his fault if anything went wrong.
 Even though it was Amonas who had dragged him into all this mess, he felt
 it was him all along that had guided him, kept him alive in order to untangle
 the strands of fate do their own liking in the end.
 He thought that it had seemed to be going rather well so far, considering.
 Hilderich could not know what the problem with Amonas was exactly, or whether
 the cure the machine would attempt was in any way dangerous or painful.
 He asked it anyway, knowing that the answer would be irrelevant at this
 point, but it mattered to him:

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich nodded awkwardly, while at the same time he did something he had
 never thought about in such a fundamental, vividly profound and genuine
 way: he prayed.
 Hilderich prayed for Amonas, to any and all Gods, forces of nature, or
 beings of power, whatever one might have called them.
 As a last resort, feeling it was the only thing he could do, powerless
 to act and indeed depended on an erratic, capricious and strange machine,
 he prayed to any and all that would heed his prayers.
 He prayed to no one in particular, replacing words in his mind with thoughts
 and feelings.
 He could hear the echo of his one voiced thought though: 'Please'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door slid back into a closed position, and then it suddenly turned transpare
nt, as if a veil had been lifted.
 Amonas form was clearly visible as a greenish liquid that closely resembled
 sewer slime started to fill the tank, rising slowly.
 The liquid was somewhat transparent but not entirely, offering a hazy view
 of the body it engulfed, shadowy and murky.
 The aura the Prosops had encapsulated Amonas within started to dissipate
 in tune with the climbing level of the liquid, letting it carry Amonas'
 weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich grimaced with distaste at the sight of the greenish liquid, an
 expression to which the machine answered with a derisive comment wholly
 intended for Hilderich:

Hilderich simply peered at the metal egg-shaped machine without saying a
 word, more worried about Amonas' fate than for the machine's personal opinion
 of himself.
 It rarely mattered to him when people expressed it, much less when a machine
 did so.
 He knew his smell was less than agreeable but that was understandable after
 more than a week without bathing.
 In any case, he couldn't care less, just as long as that didn't stop the
 machine from performing its ministrations on Amonas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he sat there watching hazily the liquid rise, Hilderich saw it would
 not stop at his chin, or his mouth.
 He instinctively yelled at the machine and went for the closet, trying
 to find a knob or handle to no avail:

The liquid was quickly filling up the entire tank, and Hilderich was manically
 trying to open the door.
 He started to pound on it with his palms and fists, with no other effect
 than a dull thudding noise.
 The liquid filled the tank entirely, and Amonas was serenely bobbing inside
 it, indistinguishable from a drowned man.
 Hilderich was shocked in silence, his mouth stunned open.
 The machine then walked close by him, his voice surprisingly calm:

It's a field enhancement medium agent, quite breathable.
 See here? There's bubbles coming out of your friends nose.

 Well, I won't physically touch him.

 Heh..
 It's getting old, isn't it? Look, if it makes you feel any better, let
 me show you the Sleeping Man as well.
 I was going to anyway, you know, check up on the guy.
 While I do that all the time, I rarely get to visit.
 You know how it is, little time for social visits.

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, tiny bubbles were rising from Amonas nose, steadily climbing up
 through the liquid, some of them seemingly trapped in the angles of his
 nose, some even clinging to his hair.
 He looked as serene as ever, slightly alien and even menacing under the
 greenish hues of the liquid, his full form unclear, slightly appearing
 and disappearing within the depth of the tank as his body was floating
 freely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, the other door pane turned transparent, the same greenish hue
 emitted from within.
 Hilderich took a step back, his interest piqued, his fears quietened for
 now.
 He felt indeed inexorably drawn to see the form of the Sleeping Man, someone
 who seemed so important, so integral to the workings of such a awe-inspiring
 place, a place where almost anything felt possible.
 Perhaps this was indeed the man he had been looking for, the man with all
 the answers to any questions Hilderich could conceive of and more.
 He felt it would be an honor, a majestic moment to look upon his true form,
 a man of legend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What he saw though, made his hair stand up and his skin crawl, his body
 tremble in sheer physical shock:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind the depths of the green liquid, inside the tank, all he could see
 was a spinal cord attached to a peculiar-looking brain, silver hair-thick
 fibers jutting from underneath, locked together and tightly connected to
 some sort of flexible tube.
 The hideous abomination was floating gruesomely in the liquid, a horrific,
 ghastly view that caused Hilderich to almost vomit in disgust.
 The sight was nightmarish.
 Hilderich tried to force it out of his mind, but the horrible image kept
 flashing in his head like it was etched in his mind forever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mind tried to concentrate on something familiar, something dear and
 important to him.
 He thought of Amonas, and the image in his head devolved to a child, someone
 he once known as a brother.
 The thought surprised him with its temerity; he thought he had cast out
 the memory of that boy long ago, but it seemed that it had lingered in
 his very soul for all those many years.
 Strangely, he found the memory of him comforting now.
 Once the initial feeling of shock had dissipated, Hilderich mustered every
 iota of self-control to keep himself from screaming the question through
 gritting teeth, fists clenched in response to his tension:

The machine bobbed slightly, wavered a little about its oval base.
 It seemed confused, as if perplexed at the sudden change in Hilderich's
 attitude.
 At length it spoke, all the while the form of Amonas a stark contrast against
 the abominable freakish sight next to him.
 The transparent door of the tank containing the abhorrence turned opaque
 once more, an oblique barrier to one's sanity.
 It resolved to speak in what sounded to Hilderich a solemn voice:

A panel of sorts opened up on the side of Amonas tank, allowing the machine

I've seen many visitors, from many different physiological backgrounds.
 Most who have seen him have found his choice most efficient.
 Those of human, or human-like forms generally found it distasteful indeed,
 but very few have reacted so badly.
 I guess it's because of your societal background.
 Less developed worlds tend to have strong affiliation with the materialistic
 conscience model, despite the fact they are consistently attracted to intangibl
e notions of a spiritual nature, like the existence of a soul and the like.
 You seem to fall in that category.

Hilderich found the machine's view somehow enlightening, though indeed blase
 and disturbing.
 It implied people were fools to believe in their soul.
 It occurred to him that it made sense, that a thing without a soul indeed
 smart enough to make assumptions and generate ideas of its own, would arrive
 at such a conclusion.
 It was a very interesting philosophical matter that Hilderich would have
 loved to discuss about, but it was neither the time or the place for such
 a discussion.
 He simply nodded then, and answered vaguely, still holding on the facade
 of the visitor, trying to learn anything of use:

The machine splashed it's middle band blue.
 From within it a grid of light beams criss-crossed the air in front of
 Hilderich, forming an image of the night sky, swirling and moving as if
 it would have seemed from someone standing on the heavens, bright spheres
 of light in various colors and sizes.
 The Prosops said in a professional tone, as if it had iterated this information
 many times over:

Certainly.
 For those of you new to the Shellworld A34B, or more commonly named as
 Nody's Claim, I welcome you to Gaming Station Agrippa.
 As you can see from the holographic projection and the data array attached,
 in case you were asleep during your transition..
 (a slight pause before continuing) we are orbiting the binary star widely
 known as Behenii 1 in most tourist star maps, also known to some of you
 colloquially as Persebs or Binary 888.
 For complete reference you should check the standard data array emitted.
 The Shellworld A34B, as most shellworlds, is a unique mega-construction.
 It encapsulates the smallest of the three stars, while it's atmosphere
 and size have been designed with oxygen-breathing lifeforms in mind.
 Sorry for the inconvenience if there are any Kiraat among you today.
 Also notable is one of the unique ways the shellworld is kept in one piece,
 using actively maintained mass-driven momentum devices in a huge network
 that completely covers the inner surface.
 I take some measure of pride in being in active control of the mechanism,
 which though quite ancient and indeed of great xenoarchaelogical interest,
 rest assured is quite safe and sound in any aspect.

Hilderich's mind was reeling from shock.
 His face remained frozen in an almost expressionless state, as if he was
 absent-minded or hard at thinking.
 But in truth, he was suddenly terrified at the immensity of the revelation.
 That was what the bullhorns had been.
 And the lone sun.
 Their own, twin suns..
 A construct? Their world, was a construct? A fabrication? It seemed as
 if it was a lie, yet he knew it not to be.
 He had seen the one sun, he had walked on the lush hot forests of the inner
 shelf.
 He had grown up near a lake under the light of the twin suns.
 The blue and yellow, easily distinguished as two suns in the winter, and
 every other dusk their colors rang true.
 So this was the truth.
 Perhaps the ultimate truth.
 What more could there be, what was more important than this? A discovery
 that would change everything.
 Their world was constructed by someone, at some point.
 And it was being used as a sideshow, a gaming resort? That was something
 he had not completely understood, and could not for a while longer, until
 his mind found some peace to try and come to grips with the world-shattering
 reality.
 It no longer was a figure of speech, but suddenly it had acquired an inescapabl
e reality of its own.
 The world was built, and it could shatter as well.
 The only thing keeping it together seemed to be this eccentric, half-crazed
 machine.
 It held both the fate of Amonas and the world in its hand.
 It was absurd.
 Utterly absurd to the point of bringing tears of laughter to Hilderich,
 who simply could not cope with all that in any way.
 So he simply laughed, despite himself, trying to fit in his head something
 that would boggle down the entire Curatoria.
 The machine looked at him quizzically, finding the man equally weird and
 intriguing.
 Hilderich half-heard it through his nervous fit of laughter, while he kept
 pointing at the star chart but nowhere in particular:

 alone have a conversation.

\begin_layout Standard
What the machine had just said made no sense at all to Hilderich, but he
 was anyway preoccupied with trying to ingest what it all implied.
 He had to learn more, he could only think of the time they had lost preaching
 to themselves about Gods, trying to remain pious, while all this time they
 could have found out.
 Master Olom had devoted his life literally to this cause.
 It was finally making sense, it was finally worth the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt tears running down his cheeks, but he couldn't know whether it was
 from the laughter or the pure and simple joy of finally uncovering what
 even his master could not have imagined.
 The whole world was an ancient piece of technology.
 But, where had they come from? What where their myths and legends for?
 What part of it was true and what not? He had to return to Pyr now, seek
 the Curatoria.
 Muster enough evidence from this place to finally convince them.
 Organize an expedition.
 Surely now they would listen?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could still hear himself laughing, imagining the look on their faces
 would have been such a treat for master Olom.
 Perhaps even the boy would rejoice, but after so many years who knew what
 had happened to him? Last he heard, his master had been murdered and no
 other word of him had reached him.
 It was uncanny at how the thought of him had appeared in his mind at this
 most unlikely of hours.
 Suddenly he heard a strange sound like a whining coming from the Prosops,
 which broke his laughter and reverie with alarming alacrity.
 The machine seemed to be encountering some difficulties, bobbing up and
 down erratically, frantically rotating and skewing as if trying to free
 itself of invisible leashes, it's voice crackling with a slow and heavy
 stutter as if it had been somehow damaged:

Hilderich wasn't aware what it meant but he believed that the term 'organic'
 probably referred to Amonas, and under the circumstances that wasn't good,
 could not be good at all.
 He asked the machine, real fear creeping up in his voice, his instincts
 waking up to realise the intensity of a completely unknown situation.
 He felt way above his head and unfortunately it was true.
 If the machine could not contain its shock, he should be utterly afraid
 of what was going to happen next.

 For a moment the thought that it was making another attempt at ill humor

 It was deadly serious.
 When Hilderich did not answer, the machine went on, this time physically
 shoving Hilderich with its bulk, forcing him to make a few steps back towards
 the entrance to the study.
 Its voice was exasperated, carrying an underlying hint of menace and danger:

I've got little reason to believe you, but there were other simpler ways

 Logic says you either don't want to, didn't know how to, or both.
 In any case, and because you seem okay as far as primitive humanoids go,
 I think you're telling the truth.
 Which only complicates things.
 To put it in terms you might understand, there was a trap in your friend's
 mind, something that can only be placed there with extreme manipulation
 of the brain at the neuron level, or in a very crude form by simpler techniques
 like hypnosis or through the use of specific substances.
 How it got there's just strange, but doesn't seem important right now.
 What happened was, when I tried to reroute your friend's neuron to bypass
 the problem area that had blocked his prime functions, making him pretty
 identical to a breathing sack of meat, the frigging trap went off.

Hilderich shook his head left and right to indicate he hadn't a clue.
 Hilderich's eye caught some strange activity from behind the machine, but
 his entire mind was focused on what the machine was saying, never really

 The machine seemed to sag in mid-air but continued in its previous rhythm,
 his voice unstoppable:

Never mind, it seems you don't.
 When the trap went off, it took me by surprises, the various defenses and
 built-in mechanisms failing to contain a series of pre-programmed attacks,
 attacks which could only have been devised by someone intimately familiar
 with my structure and design.
 In the confusion and in my panic to protect as much of me as possible,
 I started shedding control subsystems, disconnecting them.
 Think of it as chopping my own arms off trying to avoid a disease spreading
 to my heart and killing me, okay? Now, in that processing I seem to have
 irreversibly placed as much of my conscience and intelligent functions
 in this scrap of metal, the avatar, the Prosops.
 I got nothing else than this piece of metal and the anti-grav unit to go
 about.
 No field effectors, no transient resonance capacity, nothing.
 Not even data feeds.
 Like I said, I'm dead, dumb and blind.
 The control functions seem to have been neurally linked with that guy in

 And in the process I might have let other stuff seep through.
 Like the guy in the other tank.

A curious sound was heard then, like the muffled splash of water, and a
 thud or perhaps something more.
 Hilderich was the first to notice, even though he was trying to make sense
 of what the machine was saying.
 They were both facing each other, and none of them had a clear view of
 the tank.
 When Hilderich asked the machine what it had meant by saying the other
 guy had seeped through, it was not the voice of the machine that answered
 him, but the eerily familiar voice of Amonas, its tone though preternaturally
 odd, radiating a sickly feeling:

They machine turned around sharply, and Hilderich side-stepped to see Amonas
 standing outside the tank, the thick viscous liquid of the tank dripping
 slowly off him, as if the womb of something hideous had just bore him.
 The man in front of them looked like Amonas, but his eyes were not the
 pale blue of the kind, persevering, faithful man that was Amonas.
 They were a baleful force, two blue sparks of malevolence.
 It all looked utterly wrong, but it was irrevocably real.
 This was not Amonas.
 Before Hilderich could utter a word, the man who used to be Amonas spoke,
 Amonas' gruff voice twisted, each word a venomous slur:

Your point of view depends on where you stand when you look at everything.
 That's a universal truth, one of the few that appears to not be ephemeral,
 but rather woven into the fabric of the cosmos.
 From my point of view, Amonas is dead and gone, his conscience and reason
 wholly erased, replaced with my mind, my mental state, me.
 The real me.
 Only his body remains, but that too, is now mine.
 I must have looked hideous in my former state, isn't that right Hilderich?
 Is that not what you thought when you laid eyes upon my biological remains?
 No, I cannot read minds although I usually see right through people's thoughts.
 You are so easy to read, especially humans in this world.
 I would have opted for storage in a computer matrix or an aether device,
 but I am so hedonistic, I must admit, that I cannot live without the immediacy
 of the flesh, the senses from millions of nerve receptors flooding my mind.
 Some consider it crude, ineffectual, poor style.
 I only care about what I think.
 I find the human form so exceptionally vulgar and so thoroughly imperfect
 that I relish every minute of the sensations it imparts.
 You could say I've grown attached to it by now.

Hilderich's mind was awash with troubled feelings of guilt, anxiety, hatred
 and fear.
 It was a mind-numbing mix that left him utterly helpless, devoid of the
 will to oppose the man or thing he was now facing.
 It was as if a demon from tales told to little children had literally grown
 into flesh and bone, the flesh and bone of his friend.
 He barely managed to ask the man in a desperately anguished voice:

Hilderich reeled with manifest horror weighing him down, making his legs
 weak, sagging his shoulders as if he had been pierced by an arrow through
 the heart.
 His knees fell on the plush carpet, his hands had gone limp.
 There was always more to the truth, it seemed.
 With eyes wide from the shock of unimaginable despair, he lay there, slightly
 trembling as if a chilly wind had suddenly swiped through the amply lit
 room.
 As his sight was fixed on the face of a man he had loved as a friend, tears
 ran freely down his cheeks, unable to contain them.
 He had seen a friend transformed unwillingly into a beast of many faces,
 a being of ultimate deceit.
 And now, as the machine had said, it had been given absolute control of
 their world.
 He had tried to save a friend, and it had led him to surrender control
 of an entire world, his own world, to something sinister, he knew.

If the Prosops had eyes, it would have been staring blankly at Agrippa,
 unable to answer or indeed think of an answer.
 Agrippa's verbal assault had left the machine silent, quite contemplating
 what the man had just said.
 Hilderich's tears had dried up by now, and a frown was creasing up his
 forehead, wary of the machine's inability to answer in kind, much less
 so act against a man who had already lived thousands of lives and made
 a playground of a whole world and countless generations of its people.
 Agrippa started to pace up and down the room in a knowing fashion, as if

You were fooled, Centron.

 He taught them, made them learn science and technology, freed their minds
 from superstition and all that righteous bullshit he seems to actually
 believe himself.

 Hilderich saw the jutting veins in the body that had belonged to Amonas.
 He could see Agrippa was on the edge, his body tense with fury.

 answering his own rhetorical question:

They build a whole new continent across the northern ocean.
 That's what they did.
 And all the while I was busy conquering the whole world from behind the
 scenes, only to set it ablaze in a great pyre of religious fervor without
 even once blooding my own hands, that bastard's son created a new continent
 across the northern ocean.
 He actually made them built a frigging continent.
 The map had changed! And you knew nothing! I had burned the world down
 nine times, not once, but nine times! Each time, I drove myself to the
 brink of madness trying to understand where I had broken the rules, where
 I had overstepped, why it always came down to a frigging draw! And then
 I read the tale of Umberth, and I knew.
 The northern continent was not part of the game board.
 It was as if it did not exist, in the most material way.
 The soil was not part of the game board, the plants were not part of the
 game board.
 Guess what else grows from soil?

People grow from soil! That's right! A carbon based life-form, rich in water.
 The frigging bastard grew his own people! Can you believe how arrogant
 that is? He makes me want to physically vomit with disgust! He grew his
 own people, and taught them to waltz in here and go to that very special
 little secret place we players know you have, your precious seed.
 Because you'd want to host another game once this one's done, right? So
 all you'd have to do, is reset the machine, right? Start from scratch,
 right? Well this is it, the tenth time we've started the frigging game
 just because every one of those bastard children of the Waking Man share
 his mark in their genes.
 And guess what? You can't kill a player, can you? That would be against
 the rules.
 And you also have to accommodate him, don't you? Show him around the place.
 Now, this is the funny bit.
 These guys, they seem to be the Walking Man, since they have his gene.
 But there seem to be so many of them, so they must be pawns.
 But they're not made like the other pawns, they seem different, they don't
 belong to the game-board.
 So if someone that looked like the Walking Man came time and again into
 the heart of you asking to surrender as he has every right to do so, Centron,
 but at the same time was not part of the game-board, what would you do?
 Tell me Centron, what would you do? What the frig did you do nine times
 in a row?

The player's complete genotype has to be uniquely marked and its constituent

 the initial structure of the shellworld.
 I would then proceed to find a logical gap, since I could identify multiple
 valid marks with only one being within the game board.
 Cumulatively, such an error would at some point cause me to throw an exception
 interrupt, invalidating myself and..
 reseeding in hope that the error was a randomly inserted unforeseen factor

 Agrippa had seemed to have regained some measure of self-control, now that

 its task, which it boiled down to hosting the game and administering the

The logical error counter maximum is 127.
 Given that each of these loony bins seem to have been visiting regularly
 each 12 years, that would give an approximate estimate of reseeding every

 1422 times nine is 12798 years.

That's right, you worthless piece of machinery.
 That's why I had to step up things from my side lately.
 I had made a backwards turn, spinning the spindle the other way around.
 I led things this tenth time a little different than the others.
 I led people into a religious frenzy, devoted believers but somehow relaxed,
 not so much bent on destruction and killing in the name of their gods,
 but obedient, unremarkable, so predictable.
 Still I nurtured them with a festering indignation, something that I tended
 to exacerbate from time to time.
 Uprisings, little revolts, small riots.
 Something to remind the more daring souls that they were being oppressed,
 hunted down, their lives used as oil for a ruthless machine.
 I also created instituted the Curatoria.
 A lovely little organization of mumbling idiots that believed they were
 so much different from the rest, so much better, so scholarly and knowledgeable
, being fed on trinkets and treasures past from civilizations that had gone
 extinct in my fruitless attempt to win this frigging game.
 And lo and behold, I began to see the error of my ways.
 I learned of the northern continent, a myth I had notched up as folk tales
 and ravings of mad men.
 And when I saw the girl, that dark skinned girl that Umberth had found,
 I knew it was of his making.
 It had the mark of his skin, so blatant and so obvious to me it became
 at that time that it was a bastard child of his, a thing that grew of his
 arrogant ways.
 Such a hypocrite! I knew he was fumbling with the Centron somehow, seeing
 someone carrying his mark around the game board as if nothing was amiss,
 the game still running, the timer not yet reset.
 It troubled me for an endless amount of time, during which I spent long
 years trying to figure the exact way in which he wrenched the Centron's
 gears.
 And I found it when that servant wrote down his telling story of the mysterious
 northern tribe.
 Without knowing, the consistent writing down of their customs and rituals
 led me to identify them as his own creations, as well as calculate the
 period of their visits, or pilgrimages as they call them, to the Centron,
 all from a single reference.
 I knew then that there was something very specific about the number 127,
 it always happened on the 128th peregrination.
 Always.
 And then I remembered the seed and how pivotal it's role actually is: the
 rules of the game clearly state that 'in the highly improbable case of
 a technical error, the current game ends in a draw and is reseeded to allow
 the players a fair second chance at winning'.
 In the words of the technologists of a long lost civilization, I'd found
 a bug.
 And then all I had to do was exploit it.
 That's where you and your most accommodating friend come in the picture,
 Hilderich.

I read your master's work Hilderich.
 He seemed a genuinely smart person, for someone in the Curatoria.
 His suspicions were mostly correct, but as you have seen not in any way
 he could have imagined.
 Based on these suspicions, I laid out a trap.
 What you've come to know as keystones themselves are not special in a particula
r way.
 They are indeed merely free give-away gifts for the spectators.
 Indeed, what you and your master held in such high esteem as artifacts
 of a long lost civilization are nothing more than the detritus of a certain
 kind of people in the developed universe that are filled with ennui, and
 find such games on shellworlds a welcome diversion.
 Some even pay to watch live not from the Centron, but from the game-board
 itself.
 Yes, off-worlders have roamed about your world, filling it with with their
 junk, which you then mistook for important.
 In a sense, to you their importance remains unchallenged.
 That keystone your master had in his care, that was a keystone I had personally
 entrusted to him, a ticket for a way in.
 Don't act so surprised, Hilderich.
 Perhaps, you're wondering by now, why he hadn't used it himself? Why hadn't
 he tried to at least? Why did he rarely ever speak of it himself? What
 is it that made him tick, Hilderich? Tell me, Hilderich, what do you remember

Hilderich's unease and suspicion grew exponentially? How deep was this thing's
 scheme that it extended to master Olom? Why did he ask him such irrelevant
 questions at this hour? Was he belatedly or mockingly trying to befriend
 him.
 He chose silence over expressing his ire frivolously.
 There would be ample time for that when nothing else could be done.
 Secretly, without even admitting it to himself, he believed that time was
 approaching fast now.
 Agrippa went on, once more assuming the role of the man with all the answers.
 If nothing more, Hilderich had found whomever he had set out to, the man
 his master did not dare to.
 Agrippa spoke in the gruff undertones of Amonas, this time almost true
 to his original timbre:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I know you can barely remember a lake and a boy not very much unlike you.
 Perhaps you might also remember a young, golden hair girl.
 Olom was not always the quietly wizened old man he looked like when he
 died, Hilderich.
 He was a curator, a seeker of knowledge.
 He was good at what he intended to devote his life to.
 I admired that in a man, even an unwilling, unknowing pawn.
 He had focus, a sense of purpose, and his ideas might be able to spread,
 affording me an uncannily expedient though far-fetched way of getting inside
 and breaking the vicious cycle of endless repetitive draws.
 Of course I could forfeit the game, and so could the other bastard as well,
 but we both knew that would only happen the world's inner star froze over.
 So I approached him, I appealed to his darker side, the less illustrious
 one, the more vicious side.
 His human side.
 I tempted him with forbidden knowledge, offered him artifacts and trinkets
 he had never seen before.
 At first, he had actually believed he had my unremitting support and help
 so he could achieve a victory of sorts against the dark forces that sought
 man's eternal struggle.
 I presented myself as a reformer, a bright spiritual leader unlike the
 ones that had come before me.
 I promised him the dawning of a new era, with him uncovering the secrets
 that would finally make it practical and true.
 I took great joy in that role, but the best part was when I forced him
 to take you in, Hilderich.
 When I sent away his daughter, when I smeared his name forever, when I
 made her loathe him.
 When I told him that should anything happen to you, his daughter's life
 would be forfeit, he became a most willing subject.
 I had told him that at the appointed hour, I would come for him and the
 child.
 He knew that if that happened in his lifetime he would have to kill himself,
 make it believable, make it look authentic.
 You had to run for your own life, with conviction, made of necessity and
 free will.
 I'd be breaking the rules then.
 I wanted you to run that night, run like hell, run like a river of fire
 was rushing right behind your heel.
 I wanted you to run without never looking back.
 Do you remember that night Hilderich? You looked back for the merest instant,
 but you did not dare look twice.
 You saw me that night Hilderich.
 It was me, or at least, an apparition of mine, a hologram, an aspect of
 my avatar I am rarely allowed to use.
 I saw then the fear in your eyes, as I now see your disbelief.
 He raised you indeed like a bastard son, I'll give him that.
 What's the matter, why are you crying? It's alright Hilderich, you can
 call me father if you like.

 Celia, such are the ways of things from what I know and what I can gather.
 I do not expect you to believe me outright but neither should you attribute
 what I've said to old age or think them to be the sayings of a madman.
 What I have told you is the truth, the way of things behind the veil that
 has been put in front of your eyes.
 I have seen countless sunsets, I have walked over sand and snow, traversed
 the mountains and journeyed across the Great Sea.
 I've loved this world dearly ever since I first walked on it, and I'd give
 my life freely if that would save it.
 Alas, that is not possible.
 The Sleeping Man, the Patriarch as you know him is set on winning this
 game I told you about, this sadistic, twisted version of a game that has
 plagued this world as well as you, your people and your ancestors.
 Your world has perished nine times already, Celia, scraps of people being
 spared their lives when the Sleeping Man saw fit.

 Because he believed such knowledge could change a hard, deceitful, uncaring

 every sleepless night wishing I had never been born? When time after time
 my body and soul were ravaged by those beasts that call themselves men?
 What kind of father wishes that for his child? Tell me, sir Perconal, what
 kind of father would wish a life of torment instead of a merciful death?

They were both sitting opposite each other on a pair of withered old chairs,
 remnants of a past gone by when the jester seemed to had enjoyed a certain
 degree of lavishness.
 That held true no more, but the man had somehow maintained an air of dignity.
 He was after all, as he said so himself, venerated as a God by the people
 he had raised as sons and daughters.
 Celia had found that hard to believe, but it did not struck her as impossible.
 A game that toyed with the lives of every man, woman and child on the world.
 She knew life could be unbearably hard and cruel, she had lived in such
 a world for years.
 That someone had thought of turning it into a game of sorts suddenly felt
 almost reassuring.
 It meant that life was cruel in more than one way.
 It was a cynical thought, she had admitted to herself, but it was true.
 Truth was always hard and unforgiving.
 She noticed that the old man had fallen silent, staring at her compassionately,
 unable to express a proper answer to her question.
 Celia asked him then earnestly:

He's not a man.
 He's a beast.
 In the most literal sense.
 He abandoned his original form untold millenia ago.
 He has been playing this sick game for what could possibly be eons.
 He's kind of a myth among the rest of the players and the followers of
 the game.
 A sort of unofficial champion, a player of immeasurable victories in the
 past.
 I only entered the game hoping to put an end to his career of death, carnage,
 and destruction.
 Every one of his games has ended in mass genocide, water turned to blood
 flowing freely as rivers from a mountain top.
 Someone should have stopped him.
 Someone should have stopped the game.
 The universe is mad and cruel enough without this madness that some have
 the nerve to call a game.
 For a long time I thought I could turn the tables to my advantage.
 I found a way to cheat, for there was little else one could do against
 a player of his awesomely vicious talents.
 I've spent thousands of years trying to find a chink in his armor, but
 to no avail.
 All I could ever was postpone the inevitable.
 And in the meantime I've watched the people of this world suffer, again
 and again.
 But you must understand, I could not forfeit.
 I had to make a stand.
 He has to be stopped.
 Perhaps, there is hope yet.
 This time, is different than the rest.
 This time he has made a radical shift in his strategy.
 He found out the manner in which I had been cheating and concocted a devious
 plan to break the deadlock in the game.
 I'm afraid Amonas is part of that plan.

Celia was quick to anger and instinctively pulled her baby closer to her,
 and with a sudden jerk stood upright, the chair behind her falling to the

You misunderstood dear Celia.
 I did not say he has done so willingly.
 He has been deceived, manipulated, as is usually the way of Agrippa.
 That's his true name, at least the name with which he enters each game.
 Even before you met him, Amonas had been a trusted soldier in the army.
 An officer, a bright career in front of him.
 As far as I know, he was fearlessly devout, excessively strong of faith.
 A fanatic, a zealot who would anything for the glory of the Pantheon.
 He was hand-picked by Agrippa, and agreed to have his mind manipulated.
 I was there, Celia.
 I saw him enter the Patriarch's quarters on more than one occasion.
 He was an infiltrator to our cause, I had known, but I could not risk exposing
 him at the wrong time.
 Perhaps I was in error.
 The Patriarch had sought to use him as a tool for a variety of purposes,
 and it seems he hasn't failed him yet.
 Amonas was led right into the hands of a young man in possession of a keystone,
 an artifact that seems to enable its wielder to enter the game center,
 where the real Agrippa is located, the place from where he actually plays,
 controlling his avatar.
 I believe his mind was somehow programmed to lead this man into the hands
 of Agrippa.
 My best guess is he's going to use them both to break the deadlock and
 leave this world before it is torn apart.

Listen to me! I know it's almost impossible to believe me, but he could

 He had become his toy, his faithful puppet.
 If it's any consolation though, his heart was pure.
 He believed he was doing the right thing, he believed he was part of the

 He believed his future lay in a bright free world, by your loving side.

As Perconal said these words, Celia was walking away into the labyrinth
 maze of the network of caves, her child hugged close to her chest.
 She picked a direction almost at random, trying to remember where the road
 was about to take them, though it made little difference to her at that
 time.
 Then she heard his voice in her head, and her child began crying anew,
 terrified at the sudden intrusion, it clutched at his mother with the strength
 of despair.
 The boy might not have understood what the voice had meant, but she had.
 As she turned her brisk walk into a jog, she felt a deep rumbling noise
 course through the rock, every wall and ceiling around her vibrating with
 sudden intensity.
 Her jog turned into a running, and before long she was frantically trying
 to escape these caves, find her way back onto the surface and the light
 of the suns.
 The vibrations were growing stronger, people were rushing out from their
 dwellings, filling the corridors with jostling bodies, panicked, with nowhere
 to go.
 No one knew what exactly was happening, but she suspected that they had
 all heard the voice of the Patriarch.
 Their faces were a strange blend of fear and anger.
 For a while, it seemed like the tremors had stopped.
 As she lay amidst the crowd, she felt an immense sense of loneliness.
 She exchanged looks with her child.
 It somehow knew what she was thinking.
 She would never see her love again.
 The child would never meet his father.
 The child's future was here, now.
 It was not bright.
 But at least, it was warmer close to her.
 She touched his forehead with one hand, and then covered the boy's eyes.
 She felt a dull thud reverberate through her body, and then the sound of
 splitting rock.
 The earth was shattering around them.
 The people screamed in helpless unison and then everything was covered
 in dust, rock, and soil.
 Her last thought was of Amonas on their wedding day.
 Her last sensation was the touch of his lips upon her own.

The words had flown freely from him with fervor when he had uttered the
 prayer of salvation.
 God had answered his prayers and the demon had left him alone.
 It had been too late for his brother though.
 The servant of t They had said to him: 'Only a man of God may enter and
 leave.
 Only a man of God can see the wonders inside.
 Speak truth, and you will enter.
 The archenemy had struck him down in a single fiery flash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim saw the charred body of his brother and wept, precious tears
 dripping on the sand at his feet.
 He performed the rites according to the tradition as best as he could.
 There was no snow to cover the body of his brother, no ice water from a
 lake to rain him with and cleanse him of his sins.
 There was no thistle, no grub or bush to leave by his side in memory of
 the soil.
 It was a poor way to treat a brother well-met in the Land of God.
 But if thus it had come to be, and it was his sin alone to carry to his
 grave.
 When his time came, he would accept the rightful punishment of his God,
 and meet with his brother in the soil from which all life grew.
\end_layout

He dug a shallow grave, his hands unable to dig deeper into the wet sand
 far below.
 He thought that it would have to do.
 He covered him with sand, and prayed that his soul would receive whatever
 it was due, whether it be punishment or praise.
 He was now in the hands of God, and that was the Pilgrim's sole consolation
 in the matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He set out once again, to reach the Forge of Stones, to end his pilgrimage,
 fulfilling his mission and his duties.
 He had one more reason now, and that was his brother's death at the hands
 of the archenemy's servant.
 He had known the danger's that lay even in the Land of God.
 It was his duty to protect his care-free brother, and he had failed.
 He was not overcome with grief, but with righteous fury.
 If God willed it so, he would be ready to dispense his wrath to the minions
 of the archenemy.
 By blade, hand or prayer, he would shatter them like ice in the spring,
 that much and nothing less the oath on his brother's grave demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim walked in solitude, the sand and wind as ever his companions.
 The Land of God was silent around him, but it spoke to his very soul, demanding
 vengeance to be exacted.
 He trudged along over the sand, unyielding, tenaciously leaving footmarks
 behind him only to be swept away by the desert breeze, slowly but surely.
 He lost track of time, never once looking up to the suns, their ride across
 the sky unimportant to him when his purpose was clearly visible in front
 of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As if they had not been there before to notice, he suddenly reached the
 high walls of the Garden stretching in front of him as far as his eyes
 could see.
 He could see the spirals that tempted the dominion of the sky, the arches
 that rose as if in solemn prayer to God, and the Holy Gate beyond which
 his purpose lay.
 It had been a moment of excited relief for him.
 He remembered the preachings of the elders, and the Pilgrim who had come
 before him, and did as they had done, as so many others had done before
 them all, for innumerable springs and endless winters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He touched the Gate, uttering the mantra of God, making his sign, kneeling
 down as the rites required of him.
 But it was no mere tradition, he could see.
 God was there with him, alongside him, dousing him with lights of many
 colors.
 He listened to an answer to his incantations in the tongue of God, the
 sacred tongue that none of his people had ever uttered, and never would
 lest they defile him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gate opened to allow him inside the Garden.
 In wonder and astonishment he saw the Chariot of God fly from the depths
 below, rise to meet him, without a sound, in perfect grace and harmony.
 Tears of rapture ran down his cheeks, while he praised his God and Lord,
 the deliverer of his people, Father to them all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Chariot moved with the speed of the wind, and what he saw filled him
 with overpowering awe at the glory and majesty that the workings of his
 God radiated.
 He saw the beauty and he marveled at the size of it all.
 Through darkness came God's light, through nothingness and chaos came shape
 and sight.
 His face shone from the light of God's angels, performing their appointed
 tasks with harmony, diligence and piety.
 It was a sight that made him feel his life could not end until he had himself
 told of his pilgrimage to the next in line.
 He now understood why the pilgrimage mattered so to his people: He knew
 it was not for fear of losing the sacred stones, and the heat and light
 that shone with him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These were God's gifts, which he freely gave and could freely take away.
 But his greatest gift was his Garden, his Garden of wonders with which
 he filled a man's soul with indomitable will, unbreakable spirit.
 What the Pilgrim felt could not be compared to any emotion he had experienced
 before.
 It was not pride, it was not honor.
 It was neither fervor or awe, or anything like that combined.
 It was love.
 The Garden filled a man's soul with love, the love of God, the love of
 his people, so they may endure, and live on to worship his name.
 'Glory be to God!' shouted the Pilgrim while the Chariot carried him aloft
 now, passing over all of God's wonders and heading to the heart of the
 Forge, where the pilgrimage would end, and he would be given the honor
 of bringing back the Holy Stone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw now that the Chariot was leading him to a tower that reached into
 the very ceiling itself, both ends lost in the interminable darkness above
 and below.
 Suddenly, the Chariot was dipping sharply below him, while he comfortably
 sat within, as if the invisible hand of God held him safely in place, without
 fear of him ever falling off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a matter of moments, the Chariot came serenely to a stop, having brought
 him in front of a remarkable work of marble, delicate and exquisite, holy
 in its magnificence, adorned with the grace of God who surely must have
 wrought it himself.
 He knelt, bowing low so as to have his head touch the marble steps laid
 out before him, never speaking but simply offering his silent prayers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doors to the heart of the Forge were open.
 He could see a long corridor leading to a well-lit room, the Sacred Chamber.
 He could see little of the signs and markings that he had been told to
 expect, but he was safe in the knowledge that his God was leading his way,
 his angels all around him, his Chariot bringing him to the place God had
 ordained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He passed under the arched doorway and made the sign of God.
 What he saw though unnerved him: the walls were made of wood and were embellish
ed with monstrous carvings.
 Hideous forms seemed to leap at him, visions of demons jutting from every
 side.
 This was blasphemy! This was the work of the archenemy! It was clear as
 ice to him.

The thought came unbidden to his mind, springing up from the well of his
 soul.

'This is the work of evil, and it shall burn.'

\begin_layout Standard
He could now hear a coarse voice, rising and falling like the tide.
 It was strident and harsh.
 It was the voice of a beast rather than the voice of a man.
 He rushed through the corridor, a prayer on his mouth and the blade on
 his hand, ready to taste the blood of demons.
 Other sounds could be heard as well.
 He could hear other voices as he turned his brisk walk into a jog, a kind
 of struggling sound and a dull thud, not much unlike the sound of rock
 upon rock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the light grew more intense, his sight adjusted and he could see more
 clearly inside the room in front of him.
 There was a metal demon thrust against a wall, and two men grappling, embraced
 in a vicious fight.
 What he saw filled him with fury, wrath, and the grace of God filled him
 with strength he had never felt before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw the archenemy, trying to take the life of a man.
 The both spoke in the tongue his brother had lapsed in a few times, little
 he could understand.
 But he knew what he had to do now, his purpose clear as daylight.
 He ran as if a river of fire was fast behind his heels, and he could have
 sworn he could hear the voice of God urging him to avenge all the lives
 the beast before him had claimed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He lunged with terrible might and purpose at the human form of the beast
 which could not fool a man of God.
 It seemed to have paid him no notice, but the man had somehow known, and
 had made a small step, just in time for the Pilgrim blade to run the beast
 through and through its heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beast was stunned in silence, its face became a mask of pain and horror,
 utter disbelief in the deep blue of its eyes.
 It wore a man's visage, a face that might have looked beautiful, even honorable
 if it had belonged to a brother.
 It was the face of a deceiver though, and its life was now seeping away,
 its grasp on the young man fading quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The archenemy collapsed on his feet, his eyes rolling backwards with only
 the white of his eyes visible.
 The Pilgrim had never thought he would be chosen to kill the archenemy,
 if that was what had happened.
 He had never even heard the wise elders mention such a thing.
 He just was, he simply existed to oppose God.
 Had he made an error? Was this not God's will? He listened to his thoughts
 and was confounded.
 He followed the elders' advice and remained true to his heart.
 He saw the archenemy before him, and killed him with one swift blow.
 He had not thought it possible, but God had allowed.
 Indeed, perhaps God had led him here to confront his nemesis.
 It might have been a hubris, but perhaps he was God's chosen champion.
 Perhaps the appointed hour had come.
 It had all happened so soon, merely moments had passed and it had all ended.
 He looked about him, a frightened expression of horror, shock and surprise
 on the young man's face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he saw the demon of metal, which seemed to exist still despite its
 master's demise.
 His body tensed and tried to lunge at him, but the young man threw his
 hands at him and constrained him, shouting in his strange tongue.
 As he was about to push him away, their eyes met, and he could see something
 flashing inside them.
 His hands went slack and he dropped his blade.
 He remembered the teachings: 'At the appointed hour blood will be spilled,
 and tears will be shed.
 Weep no more, for the end will be nigh.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Pilgrim looked slackly at the young man.
 He made a motion with his hands to the Pilgrim to calm him down, make him
 sit.
 He pointed at the demon which seemed to be somehow in league with him,
 an unlikely ally or a renegade perhaps, he could not be sure.
 It looked as if it did not intend him or the man any harm.
 That too, must have been God's work, he thought, and left it at that for
 now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly while the young man kept repeating questions the Pilgrim could
 not understand, everything around them started trembling.
 Things fell from the wooden walls and crystals shattered.
 He could feel the rumble of the earth deep inside him, he could hear its
 death throes.
 The world was going to end, he knew.
 It had been the last Pilgrimage.
 Tears ran down his throat and cheeks, and a loud prayer formed on his lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metal demon and the young man were frantically exchanging words.
 Fear had taken over them, the fear of death.
 The Pilgrim found why or how they had been allowed inside the Gardens unfathoma
ble, but who was he to question God's plan.
 They were trying to make him move, take him with them wherever they planned
 to escape.
 He shook his head rigorously, refusing such petty dishonor.
 They did not seem to understand there was no escape.
 He would finally meet God, having offered him as much of his life in service
 as he could.
 He would meet the newly found and lost brother of his, and tell him of
 how he had avenged him.
 He would meet his father, and tell him of the last Pilgrimage.
 He would meet every soul of his people in the heavens, and tell them of
 his tale about the Forge of Stones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the earth shook with even more violence, pieces of the room around him
 started to fall off their place as if an invisible being of terrible might
 picked them apart.
 In the distance he could see the demon and the man running aimlessly out
 the corridor, trying vainly to save their lives, perhaps their souls too,
 if the demon had any.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As everything went dark around him before finally crumbling on top of him,
 he could see the young man turn his head in his direction and shouted something.
 It sounded like something his brother had told him in the desert.
 With the last of his breathes, and nothing but a numbing feel running down
 his spine to remind he was barely alive, he tried to say the words himself:

 interior of the ship felt like a mansion: fine tapestries lined the wooden
 walls and thick handwoven carpets adorned the floors.
 Most of the ship was decorated in the same fashion, with the engines and
 the assorted support mechanisms and infrastructure taking up little space.
 According to Prosops it was a refurbished luxury yacht.
 The whole den back on the Centron was actually a shipyard, something of
 a hobby the Centron had taken up to spent his endless time and unlimited
 resources, acute intelligence and insurmountable flair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though Hilderich could not have known what other ships similar to this
 one looked like, he felt impressed by the taste the machine had shown,
 and genuinely believed it to be a fine ship, even though the Prosops had
 insisted on him using the term 'astrogational vehicle'.
 Hilderich had ignored the machine profoundly on that matter and kept calling
 the ship, 'ship'.
 He had warmed up on the machine's name though, and now called it as it
 had preferred to refer to itself: Ron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich had been busy resting most of the time at first, but he did spend
 some time with the machine, which naturally saw to the daily routine of
 maintaining the ship, checking and plotting their course, as well as trying
 to update Hilderich on the workings of the universe and the general state
 of affairs in the civilized galaxy.
 It had never occurred to Hilderich that there could ever be more knowledge
 than he could ever hope to understand in millions of life-times, but he
 would sadly have to do with as much as he could manage in one life-time,
 which was quite a lot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ron had filled him in with as much detail as it could concerning the game,
 the shellworld and what had transpired.
 He was shocked to find out there were literally thousands of shellworld
 not very much different than his own, hosting games like the one that had
 been using everybody on his world as unwilling, unknowing pawns.
 What had really challenged his sanity though, was the sight of a world
 being destroyed.
 It was not something any man was supposed to ever witness in his life,
 and Hilderich had seen it happen in slow, aggravating detail, before finally
 averting his red sore eyes.
 At that moment he had decided to stop that from happening ever again, to
 the best of his ability.
 He had never really returned Amonas' favor.
 He could think of no better way to honor the memory of him, Celia, and
 their child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he recovered from the shock, Hilderich contemplated the last moments
 in the Centron.
 After the strange man had appeared as if out of nowhere and killed Agrippa,
 everything had happened too fast to actually remember.
 Ron had filled him in, replaying a recording of the scene that had taken
 place.
 Once Agrippa died, there was nothing in the way of keeping the place running
 and everything happened with the speed of an avalanche, gathering incredible
 momentum with every passing moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hilderich had tried to save the man from certain death, as Ron had indicated
 they had little more than a few minutes before the whole world would break
 up in a catastrophic event that could not be reversed.
 The strange man would not come and Ron was forced to push Hilderich aside
 and keep shoving him almost all the way to the nearest ship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The machine took great pride in the fact that without his hobby they would
 be 'dead meat', as it said in its usually flamboyant manner.
 It had also agreed to help Hilderich on the quest he had vowed to undertake,
 since as it had said itself:

And so they were ploughing on the vastness of space, speeding away from
 the Binary 888.
 Ron was looking intently at a star chart, its black band of glass colored
 cyan, in a desperate attempt at trying to be, in his own words, 'rad',
 a colloquialism that Hilderich never inquired further about.
 What he did inquire about though upon seeing the machine intently studying
 the holographic projection in front of him, was their destination, to which
 the machine had said without turning to face Hilderich:
