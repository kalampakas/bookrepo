I sort of rather like the fellow.
 I think he's the kind of man that really goes out of his way when needs
 be.
 Even looks like he could take a bloody bullet if it came to that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the general said while handpicking deliciously-looking morsels of meat
 from the buffet arrayed out in front of him, as if it had been arranged
 for his pleasure alone.
 Suddenly, he turned to face his aide-de-camps, always three footsteps behind
 him, his medals, decorations, citations and merits dangling and jiggling
 with the equivalent effect of a dancing fool laden with bells and whistles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What do you think of the man, Ure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the general, holding a saucy meatball in one hand and a small cheese
 pie in the other.
\end_layout

I think my opinion is irrelevant, sir.
 You seem to like the man, no matter what everyone else in HQ says.
 Is my place by ysour side threatened, sir?

, Ure Bouvet, the general's aide-de-camps asked with a blinding smile, as
 if his career in the military depended on it, which in fact did.

Nonsense Ure, and you know it.
 I said the man could take a bullet for me, but he seems to attract an awful
 lot of them, especially after the incident in Manhigure.
 Besides, you know my taste in buffets all too well by now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 General Ramit said and downed a small confection to punctuate the fact
 that he thought of Trecibal Ure as a masterful culinary tactician, which
 happened to be an appreciated talent in the higher echelons of the military.
\end_layout

Thank you, sir.
 Still, you have to do something about him, sir.
 Perhaps offer him some sort of ah, contract? Or provide a charter of leeway?
 Legitimise his actions in the eyes of the world, sir.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General Ramit had a pondering look on his face.
 It was difficult to say whether his mind was preoccupied with what Ure
 had proposed about the Bel-Phon Affair, or the subtle choice between torto
 shells and gris-mas tarts.
 At length, he picked up a skewer of ortelot meat, a quality-assured fallback
 when it came to exotic buffets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hubbub in the grand ballroom started to build up as more and more guests
 arrived and were announced ceremoniously, the general waving acknowledgements
 to people he could barely identify at such a distance, even if he knew
 them in person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who are these people, Ure? Anyone important I should care to ingratiate
 myself with?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general asked his aide, glancing at a throng of excessively overdressed
 people.
\end_layout

Well, there is Vice-Governor Anewilliad, Prince Regent Rewevelde, the Conglomera
te East representative De Burgess - a crafty devil if I may add so sir -
 and they all seem to be ogling over Ms.
 Dirae, the glamorous performer with the exceptionally long list of publicised
 affairs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ure grinned shamelessly, and extending his mental heel-clicking to the
 real world, he lightly bounced on the heels of his boots, imperceptibly
 swinging to and fro like a toy soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ms.
 Dirae, you don't say? Pray tell dear Ure, what does she perform?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general asked using his tongue as the most immediately available toothbrus
h, curling his moustache at an impossibly steep angle, having his gaze fixed
 on the impressive lady like a sniper on a mark.

Largest repertoire this side of the spiral arm, or so I hear sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ure stood at ease next to the general, an air of lasciviousness permeating
 his words.
 It sounded as if the mere sight of the woman aroused him, in every sense
 of the word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I always had a soft spot for the arts, Ure.
 Think it's time to indulge myself?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general asked without loosening his gaze.
 He even put down a crab cake without bothering to finish eating it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you have made up your mind, sir.
 You are committed to action now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the aide said, positively brimming with enthusiasm as if a great city wall
 was about to be breached, ending a war, saving a planet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Indeed I have!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the general smiled, patted his mouth gently with a napkin and nonchalantly
 tossed it on the floor, hurrying to meet Ms.
 Dirae with large, parade-like strides, right about when a deafening shrilling
 sound with the reverberating qualities of a train passing by filled the
 ballroom.
 The chatter suddenly stopped along with the band, and everyone looked confused,
 right before the first shell landed at an uncomfortably close distance,
 along with a burst of flames, dirt and smoke.
 Instantly, the crowd yelled in panic and disarray as the rest of the barrage
 fell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Talk about bad timing sir!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Ure yelled above the din of the alarmingly near-by explosions and panicked
 ball guests, while at the same time he scrambled to get both himself and
 the general to their carriage with an even number of extremities still
 attached to their bodies.

I thought the damn Dusikos could not bear artillery on Ciriad, especially
 not the First Quarter!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the general exclaimed before calmly picking up his cap and arms before
 taking a last glance towards the grand ballroom.
 He added while straightening his cap:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Think this place will still be standing in the morning, Ure?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's only a ballroom sir, one of many.
 Not that important in my opinion sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ure while hastening their pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I was talking about the city, Ure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 retorted the general, looking far more grave than when he gave his formal
 speech at the start of the campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ure remained silent, focusing on navigating through the mayhem of the crowd,
 while guardsmen and officers tried to maintain some sort of composure,
 shouting evacuation guidelines to people that only read about artillery
 barrages in the comfort of their sitting rooms.
 Fortunately, the needlessly large, ornate gates had been open still; a
 deeply ingrained sense of etiquette and manners rather than frosty calmness
 had prevented a wild stampede, and the crowd had failed to squash itself.
 General Ramit shouted to Major Ure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, don't set a bad example Ure.
 Calmly escort me to the exit, no need for an alarm.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ure had been the General's aide since the start of the campaign on Dusik
 nine months ago, long enough to understand that the General was a peculiar
 man, but certainly not that daft:
\end_layout

\end_inset

But, sir! They are shelling us!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General smiled reassuringly as he smoothed his white gloves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A matter of statistics, Trecibal.
 There's time enough to get to our carriage.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trecibal simply nodded mechanically and pressed through the mass of people,
 unwilling to have a discussion on statistics, while artillery shells turned
 theory into dangerous practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were soon outside in the courtyard; the spectacle was hardly joyous
 but certainly impressive; the streaks of explosions near and afar could
 be seen, along with the harrowing sound of incoming large bore shells,
 like skytrains passing by overhead.
 Everyone was trying to get away, on foot, horseback, or car.
 Ure spotted their carriage, their driver signalling frantically for them
 to run, rather than walk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The General did not seem at all inclined, forcing the driver to focus his
 efforts into prayer, and a cache of good luck that seemed to be near an
 end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ure got to the carriage first and opened the door for General; he could
 hear the driver mumble, gnawing at his teeth nervously.
 They exchanged a couple of knowing looks, before the General finally got
 inside.
 After sighing with relief the driver let loose the horses, always eager
 to run away from the exploding shells falling around them in precarious
 quantities.
