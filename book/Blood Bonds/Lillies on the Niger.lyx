\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a radical departure from the first book, for which writing a sequel seems
 untimely or perhaps even unwanted, I'm writing Blood Bonds (working title).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The story is set during the Biafran-Nigerian civil war, or Biafran war of
 independence (depending on whose side you're on or on your POV), and especially
 in 1968.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main protagonist, and what is later revealed to be a tragic figure is
 Ethan Whittmore, a captain of the Royal Marines and a British military
 advisor in Lagos, Nigeria.
 Ethan Whittmore has served in Kenya doing commando and paramilitary work
 of a dubious nature, having done things he is loathe to talk about and
 not especially proud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Lagos he has befriended his Nigerian Liaison, James Dwele, a Major (?)
 in the Nigerian Army.
 Dwele's brother had fought in the Kenyan liberation struggle only a few
 years earlier, and had died at the very hands of Ethan.
 It was not until after they had become friends that James learned of Ethan's
 involvement, background and history.
 After an internal struggle he decided to wait in order to exact his revenge
 and did so in a methodical, cold and calculating manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Ethan's brother, Doctor Andy (Stanley?) Whittmore goes into Biafra
 with a Red Cross relief mission, Ethan tries to warn his brother and discourage
 him because of the dangers involved with going into a civil war.
 Andy is adamant and waves away his brother's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a couple of months though, all contact between Ethan and Andy is lost.
 James runs some checks with Intelligence and informs Ethan that the red
 cross camp had been raided, most possibly by a local warlord, but there
 was not a single body of a caucasian to be found, suggesting that they
 either fleed deep into the jungle, unable to get to a town for help, or
 had been kept as prisoners to be ransomed at some point in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The essence of it was that Andy was somewhere in the Biafran jungle, most
 probably alive, but certainly in danger, if not already dead and buried
 somewhere in the jungle with no hope of ever finding a body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan is torn between duty and love for his younger brother, and after being
 urged by James, he decides to abandon his posting, go AWOL and search for
 his brother.
 In that undertaking, he counts on the help of James who will provide him
 with an extraction helicopter when and if Ethan locates Andy, as well as
 updates via radio of the movement and disposition of Nigerian and Biafran
 forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan contacts an acquaintance in MI6, Ian Ruthers, a war buddy from Kenya
 who owes him a favor or two, and arranges an identity as a journalist attached
 to a red cross caravan going into Biafra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once he sets out (not from Lagos but from a large red cross camp near the
 borders) and goes through the jungle, on the second day of their trek they
 stop for supplies and rest at a French Catholic monastery, run by a few
 nuns, some French, some local converts.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole Heurgot, a nurse who claims was part of a red
 cross caravan that was attacked, and her fleet brought her to the relative
 sanctuary and safety of the monastery.
 When Ethan introduces himself as who he really is tells her he is looking
 for his brother, she says to him that not only she knew Andy and they where
 on the same caravan, but that they were also lovers and she fears he might
 be dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In truth, Nicole is a french agent, working in league with Andy.
 After she happens upon Ethan, she notifies Andy via radio (the monastery
 also doubles as a cache and forward post for french intelligence operations
 in the area which involve providing equipment to the biafrans) about Ethan's
 search.
 Andy tells Nicole to wrangle his brother around, buy some time until he
 sends some personal effects from their jungle hideout to a nearby town,
 so that they can cook up a badly charred white caucasian body that could
 be Andy, and convince Ethan that Andy is dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the meantime, Ethan contacts James and finds out that he could not cover
 for him effectively, and trying to fake his leave of absence did not work
 out.
 He has been marked as AWOL and a court-martial and certain stripping of
 rank awaits him when he returns.
 As far as the Nigerians are concerned, they fear he has turned over to
 the Biafrans, and is considered an enemy of the state to be shot on sight.
 With his own government washing its hands off him and the Nigerians who
 he had been training considering him a traitor, Ethan has nowhere to go
 back to.
 His only purpose and reason now is to find his brother, dead or alive,
 and then try to vanish somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At that point the monastery is attacked by a local warlord, and Ethan single
 handedly kills a couple of them as well as the warlord, but even though
 the rest of the bandits flee, many of the red cross men and women have
 been killed, and the rest refuse to go on and simply try to make it back
 to Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Without a valid cover Ethan then asks for Nicole's help, which she seems
 to give willingly, out of concern for Andy.
 When Ethan explains that there's nothing left for him behind, and while
 already on their way to the closest town past the borders, she reveals
 to Ethan that she is actually a British agent working under cover in Biafra,
 and she is confident that her network of agents will be able to at least
 find out if Andy is alive, and even perhaps his whereabouts.
 Not only that, but she is confident she can smuggle Ethan out of the country
 and perhaps clear his name, so that Ethan has one more reason to stick
 with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they arrive at the bordertown, they settle for the night in a shanty
 hotel.
 When Ethan wakes up, he finds out that Nicole has gone and has left him
 a note with some contacts whom he must talk with, and arranges a meeting
 in a safehouse, because of pressing business.
 In truth, Nicole left to arrange the duping of the body and the various
 contacts that are supposed to feed Ethan with false information, have him
 go around in circles only to have him find out his brother is dead in the
 morgue (a fake body).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While Nicole is away, Ethan in the back of his head is always alert and
 distrustful especially now that he believes the only man he can trust is
 James, and the only man who might actually have an escape route available.
 He contacts his MI6 man in dire need, asking to know whether or not there
 is a woman like Nicole working for the british in biafra.
 Though reluctantly, his buddy Ian tells him he'll have to do a search.
 He arranges it so that he passes a 'yes' or 'no' message via the BBC, the
 next night (perhaps a specific song, or a glitch in the clock beeps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The contact spot is a bar, where Ethan receives the message from BBC radio
 that Nicole is not who she claims she is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole, gives him the bad news that Andy is dead, his body in the morgue,
 charred and almost unrecognizable but for his dental fillings, harmonica
 and switchblade with his initials and Eton insignia (or whatnot).
 Ethan is convinced he is being lied to because his brother had a slightly
 smaller hip (or whatnot) that seemed okay in this body.
 Ethan does not openly express himself, but seems withdrawn and in mourning,
 while heavily contemplating his next move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole weeps convincingly enough, and says to Ethan that tomorrow morning
 she'll arrange passage for Ethan first to (african state bordering south
 nigeria) and then on to South Africa where he might have a better luck
 clearing his name with the army.
 For that night, they'll sleep together in the safehouse with the local
 biafran man that acts as her bodyguard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan times his attack well and catches the man off-guard.
 In the fight that ensues, the man is killed and Nicole gets away.
 Rummaging through the man's belongings he finds a few clues (key, receipts
 etc.) that lead him to expose Nicole's network as what it really is, a french
 network of agents.
 ONe of them also coughs up the location of the jungle HQ/hideout, where
 Ethan decides to go next, believing that he had been sidetracked on purpose,
 and a fake body of Andy was indeed proof that he was alive and certainly
 their prisoner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When he arrives at the site he finds out a red cross deserted camp, similar
 to what his brother's camp should have been.
 Trying to search for more clues, he is attacked suddenly and rendered unconscio
us, by his own brother Andy.
 When he wakes up he is restrained and Andy and Nicole are there , trying
 to explain to him that Andy is working for the French, and that they are
 a couple now, intent on getting married officially once their work in Biafra
 is done.
 Not only that, but Andy explains how he had grown disenchanted with the
 British imperialistic way of doing things, and that he genuinely believes
 he is helping Biafrans in their fight for independence and justice.
 Ethan says bollocks to all that, spits on his brother and can't believe
 he actually sold everything off to save a traitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They leave things at that and Andy tells his brother that he hopes he comes
 around soon or else there will be no place for him there and he would have
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

get rid of him
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In reality, Andy is a double agent working for MI6 (unbeknownst to Ian who
 could not have known that -- only handlers know such info), having infiltrated
 the French agency, supplying the british with detailed information about
 the plans and operations of the French, and waiting for the opportune time
 to bring all the french operations in Biafra to an end, effectively leaving
 the Biafrans without any outside help, and bringing the war one step closer
 to the end with the Nigerians and their friends the British on the winning
 end, awarding the oil contracts to the british.
 He arranges it so that Ethan can get out of his bonds and gives him a chance
 to escape unharmed and without alerting someone.
 That way he hopes that his brother will finally get away from his own affairs
 without jeopardising or hampering his mission, and with an added bonus,
 the french operations will be disrupted while they relocate their base
 of operations.
 The problem arises when Ethan does not think of it that way, and instead
 takes it upon himself to kill Nicole and as many French agents and collaborator
s as he can.
 When he kills Nicole, Andy is outraged: Ethan had terminated the efforts
 and work of many months with one stroke, at the wrong time.
 Andy tells him who he really is and Ethan is stunned, unable to believe.
 When he is told details and truths and shown his radio signals, Ethan finally
 believes his brother (with some good old look-me-in-the-eye fashion), and
 offers their route of escape, James.
 While they set some explosives to go off, at least maximizing the damage
 and then going off to the LZ, they are discovered and a small hunt begins,
 trying to save their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they finally reach the LZ and wait for the chopper to salvation, exchanging
 fire from a long distance, James is seen in the pilot's seat alone.
 When he touches down the chopper and the two brothers run towards it, he
 opens up the door and puts a bullet squarely through Andy's head.
 Ethan is stunned, and while James is pointing the gun at him, between tears
 and babbling, confused and overwhelmed by contrasting emotions, James retells
 Ethan how he has exacted his revenge by killing Ethan's brother, just like
 Ethan had killed his own a few years ago.
 Ethan gets into a fight with James and finally kills him.
 He is left alone in a jungle clearing with the chopper still whirring its
 blades slowly and the French still after him, his brother and his best
 friend dead beside him.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a training with Marines from the 3rd Marine Division, Ethan Whittmore
 is told by his friend James Dwele that he has had some news about his brother.
 Ethan had lost contact with his brother and had asked James to find out
 what he could, as he is the intelligence officer of the division Ethan
 is attached to as a military advisor.
 James and Ethan discuss what can be done about Andy, and Ethan proposes
 that he should go in search of his brother, bringing the example of James'
 brother who had died in Kenya and James himself was unable to help.
 Some of Ethan's exploits are discussed but he seems reluctant to talk about
 these, while James in effect traps Ethan into finding Andy so he can exact
 his revenge.
 James promises he will try and keep in touch with Ethan and they arrange
 codes and radio frequencies.
 James also says he will try to cover for Ethan but thinks that he will
 not be able to buy enought time.
 Ethan believes he can arrange a cover, and does so via a friend in the
 MI6, Ian Ruthers.
 By the end of the chapter, James and Ethan shake hands and Ethan starts
 off with the caravan, a few range rovers, local volunteers and red cross
 personnel from various countries, while his cover is Richard Owls, a journalist
 for the London Times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Well met on an ill road
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The next couple of days pass rather languidly, the backdrop of the civil
 war and the jungle scenery featuring prominently until the caravan stops
 at a catholic monastery for supply and rest, as well as local info that
 should help them to avoid fighting and reach their intended destination
 (some local town) with relative safety.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole, and he finds out some direct info about his
 brother, believing at first that Nicole is indeed a nurse who had a relationshi
p with his brother.
 By the end of the chapter, Nicole is seen contacting Andy discussing a
 course of action, revealing her identity as an French agent to the reader,
 as well as seeing that the monastery is a cache/hideout for the French
 and an exchange point for Biafrans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Right before setting out the next day, at dawn, the monastery is attacked
 by a local warlord and his group of bandits (just because he had found
 out that Biafrans are supplied from such a place and equipment and ammo
 can be found there).
 The red cross caravan is cut down by fire, while Ethan puts his skills
 to use, and after most of the personnel is dead, and while the bandits
 begin their search for the cache, Ethan cuts the throat of the warlord,
 arms himself with an assault rifle and through hiding and shooting, takes
 down more than a couple of bandits, the rest of which decide things are
 already going badly for them, and flee into the jungle.
 After the firefight, Ethan helps with the bodies after which the nuns that
 are left alive pack their few belongings and decide to leave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Heed no prayer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The caravan is now non-existent and the few survivors terrified rush back
 to Nigeria.
 Ethan has no cover now, and while thinking ways of reaching Biafra through
 the jungle, Nicole acts according to plan, which is to safely remove Ethan
 from the picture.
 Knowing his brother would go after him no matter what, Andy had arranged
 for Nicole to set up the fake body, and while they would do that, wank
 him around a border town searching for clues that lead nowhere except the
 fake dead body of Andy, the idea being that Ethan would have thought his
 brother dead.
 Nicole then in order to perform that plan tells him that she is in fact
 a british agent (and perhaps that the cache that Ethan saw etc.
 was an english cache), and that her network of agents can help Ethan with
 hisn quest, so they set out together, to arrive the next couple of days
 to the small bordertown of LALA.
 During the trip through the jungle they witness the horrors of civil war,
 and while Nicole takes a humanist approach to the subject, she is seen
 knowing a lot about the politics involved in the matter (the oil fields
 etc.).
 Ethan seems focused on finding his brother and comes across as somewhat
 cynical and distant concerninc war and its atrocities.
 By the end of the chapter, they arrive at the small town, and sleep.
 When Ethan wakes up he finds the note with the contacts and a rendezvous
 point.
 He then thinks about what he had discussed with Nicole earlier and believes
 there's something awry with her (though she has detailed knowledge of Andy,
 she puts him off), and decides to phone Ian once more.
 Ian is disturbed by what Ethan tells him has happened, and promises to
 find out or whether or not there's an agent like Nicole in the area.
 Because he will be unable to safely deliver the message otherwise, he'll
 arrange something through the BBC (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 - something from their wartime past probably - a yes or no).

 Dead men can't dance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(this is the part where Ethan learns he is now considered AWOL, a turncoat
 for the biafrans etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole's contacts are pretty worthless, feeding Ethan disinformation, and
 making him go around in circles, finding out nothing new about his brother.
 By the time the rendezvous with Nicole comes up, it's 9 o'clock and it
 is now revealed to Ethan that Nicole is not who she claims to be.
 He keeps his cools and believes he is being lied to on purpose so that
 he cannot find his brother.
 When Nicole informs him his brother is in the morgue on LARGER_TOWN he
 believes there's something very rotten going on.
 He decides to hop along Nicole and some local who is both muscle and local
 expert, part of the supposed network.
 They go to the morgue and Ethan is shown the charred remains of an unidentified
 caucasian the same height and apparent bodyweight as his brother, with
 the correct fillings and some personal effects like his switchblade, pocket
 watch etc.
 Ethan for a few moments believes he might have erred, but then notices
 his brother's leg is not a bit shorter than the other, a birth defect that
 was almost imperceptible.
 He then notices an exposed collarbone that seemed perfectly shaped while
 his brother had cracked it at a small age, and it should have been noticeable.
 Thus Ethan now has proof that Nicole is indeed someone else and actively
 trying to divert him away from Andy.
 In tears she proposes that Ethan has nothing to do other than bury his
 brother tomorrow, and go home while there's still time to clear his name,
 something she promises she'll help with.
 Ethan plays along and they leave for a house that belonged to the local
 man (Adu Nebdele), and served as a place where they could use for operating
 (truthfully, as their french base of operations in LARGER_TOWN).
 At night, Ethan pretends to be sleeping and while prowling around the house,
 Adu catches him having found the radio creche and while at first he Acts
 as if nothing's wrong, when Ethan notices signals decoded/to be sent in
 french and british movement and nigerian charts, a fight ensues and Nicole
 wakes up.
 Ethan swiftly kills Adu and Nicole escapes him.
 He decides to take action and starts to round up the so-called network,
 while Nicole flees to contact Andy in person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
6.
 Blood thin as water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan starts to terrorize the various contacts he had met before.
 Some yield the small value of info that they had been instructed to mislead
 him, some run before he can catch them, some die while trying to kill him
 and one of them is tortured and confesses the location of the french hideout
 in the jungle.
 Ethan travels to the location on foot only to find out it is an abandoned
 (the abandoned most possibly) red cross camp of his brother.
 While searching he finds out that the camp was a decoy and that there was
 a hidden underground entrance near a waterfall.
 Right before he tries to enter the complex, he is struck unconscious by
 his brother, and dragged inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
7.
 When Ethan wakes up, he is restrained to a chair, noticing the knots can
 be loosened over a few hours.
 He is not hurt, and his brother Andy and Nicole are trying to explain that
 they had simply tried to avoid him finding out Andy is an agent for the
 French, working in Biafra in order to help the biafrans achieve independence,
 and promote French interests in the oil industry.
 He and Nicole try to convince to work for them as well, and provide detailed
 info and feedback on British-Nigerian practices and plans, as well as train
 Biafrans to have an advantage over the Nigerians.
 Ethan refuses vehemently, Nicole is frustrated, and Andy leaves Ethan to
 think it over.
 In fact, Andy has arranged the knots to be easy to loose and a ready escape
 route for Ethan so he can get out of there alive and noe be part of the
 picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Instead Ethan decides to go after them both, and going into commando mode,
 kills Nicole while at the same time Andy sees him do it.
 By the end of the chapter, Andy is seen pointing a gun at Ethan calling
 him an idiot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
8.
 Andy explains to ethan that he is a double agent working for the British,
 feeding disinformation to the French, and trying to find the opportune
 time to blow up their whole operations in Biafra.
 Ethan is hard to believe it but in the end believes his brother and the
 proof he shows him.
 Now that everything has gone tits up, Ethan says he can still save them,
 and arrange an extraction via James.
 While he does so, their cover is blown and they start running for their
 lives, while the ETA is about an hour.
 In the ensuing firefights around the camp, some if it is blown off and
 then they start the run inside the jungle to the LZ.
 When the chopper finally arrives, the french are hot in their heels.
 James touches down, shoots Andy, tells Ethan the truth about him and his
 brother, Ethan kills him and is left with the chopper and the French behind
 him.

\begin_layout Chapter
In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sweat ran freely down the red-haired Englishman's temples, smearing the
 jungle camo on his clean-shaven face.
 A knife blade covered in dry mud sat in his left hand, while his other
 hand made a rough circle in the air.
 It was a hand signal for the command to encircle the target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five men melted away into the green humid jungle in a heartbeat, as if they
 had been an optical illusion.
 They moved fast; faster than what Ethan had believed them capable of.
 He decided to stand back for a little while more, and see how they could
 handle their approach on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of them stopped dead in their tracks and hunched low when they heard
 noise, probably from the direction of the clearing up ahead.
 The two men that formed the edge of the squad aimed their rifles outwards
 from the squad, as if a switch had been thrown.
 The point man laid himself flat with the silken grace of a cat, knife drawn
 in his right hand while his left hand reached out for his Colt zero-point-forty
-five.
 The rearguard moved like a pair of dancers, covering each other's back,
 both aiming their rifles from shoulder-high, safeties clicked off to single-sho
t selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that cautious small diamond formation they moved as a whole, each step
 forward made with practiced ease and well-earned confidence, the mark of
 a well-trained soldier.
 For all intends and purposes, and as far as Ethan was concerned, he had
 done a good job training them.
 What did bother him though was that they had yet to fire a shot in anger.
 He knew that nothing tests a man like real combat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though they moved precisely as they had been taught, and seemed quick and
 stealthy enough, Ethan couldn't really tell if they just went through the
 motions or if they were really up for the challenge.
 After all, no matter how much one practices before a show, it's the opening
 night that makes or breaks it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's free hand was wrapped tightly around a metal L-shaped trigger attached
 to a small box no larger than a pack of cigarettes, from which a run of
 cables protruded and got lost somewhere under the rich jungle tapestrie
 of green and brown.
 With a tight grin, Ethan whispered to himself with the expectation of a
 job well done:
\end_layout

Showtime, lads.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he double-clicked the trigger the first thing that attracted everyone's
 attention were the flashes.
 And then came the shockwaves, their force pummeling at everyone, making
 every ribcage vibrate intensely as if tremors had seized them.
 And that was just the opening note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small gun fire erupted from various well-placed locations, the muzzle flashes
 dotting the lavish scenery as if hundreds of photographers clicked in rapid
 succession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scouts instantly dived for cover, falling prone while keeping their
 arcs of fire fimly fixed to their own particular zone of responsibility.
 A wry smile formed on Ethan's face: he seemed to be enjoying the performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five trainees were on their bellies, rolling and crawling over the jungle
 bed in an effort to find as much cover as possible in mere moments.
 They exchanged quick glances and made repetitive hand motions to each other,
 communicating silently trying to establish a point where they could fall
 back away from the guns blazing at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every tree trunk and low bush or gully counted for gold at times like these,
 and the five Marine scouts from the 3rd Marine division made excellent
 use of their surroundings.
 Very much so that Ethan felt a twang of pride at seeing his handiwork in
 action.
 They were his men, and they seemed every bit as professional as he intended
 them to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They quickly abandoned their exposed position for a slightly shallow depression
 with good cover, fat tree trunks strewn around them with thick bush for
 cover and a clear view on all sides.
 A defendable position from which they could easily spot a move against
 them and fall back while they harassed their enemy firing and moving in
 turns.
 Ethan's mind flashed with the sudden realisation they were good enough
 to be Royal Marine scouts, not just Nigerian troops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost felt a hint of regret he couldn't be there with them when it really
 mattered, when the guns pointing towards them were not loaded with blanks;
 when the explosive charges half a mile away were real shells and mortars
 falling right on them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost, as Ethan reminded himself inside his head, was the eminent keyword:
 This was not his war, not by a far chance, and setting up mock engagements
 such as this one was as close as he wanted to get to another warzone.
 Except for the times when he itched, except for the times he woke up in
 the middle of the night drenched in sweat, knowing it wasn't the tropical
 heat that left him sleepless thereafter, but faces all too well remembered
 and defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team of five men had dug themselves in taking solid cover.
 The gunfire died down soon afterwards, and Ethan believed there was no
 point in continuing tracking and crossing the jungle.
 He had seen what he wanted to see, and that was a team of scouts, not a
 bunch of gung-ho Nigerians hollering with rifles raised firing on auto,
 vying for Igbo blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan raised himself above the brushes and bellowed as if he wanted the
 cadets back at Sandhurst to hear him clear as rain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team of five gave no sign of sight or sound that they had heard their
 instructor.
 Ethan repeated himself with less enthusiasm:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, games' over! Let's head back for some rest, off we go.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, nothing could be now heard other than the usual sounds of the jungle,
 the distant cries of birds and monkeys, and the constant buzzing of mosquitoes
 and other assorted exotic insects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan furrowed his brow and briefly considered that the team might have
 actually extracted themselves without him noticing, and decided to check
 the small depression himself.
 With a hurried pace, he made his way through the brush and in a few moments
 reached the position he had last seen them take cover in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw noone, but suddenly felt a piece of metal poking him through his
 left side, right between his ribs, poised to pierce his heart at a single
 thrust.
 He had been caught unawares, and once he looked sideways to his assailant,
 he saw Onko, the team scout leader smiling wildly, his bright white teeth
 a stark contrast to his camouflaged dark face.
 A little stunned and a little bit surprised, Ethan barely had time to let
 off a curse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger me, you've grown into a real scout Idowu.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

No longer wearing the same disarming smile, the nigerian marine responded
 with a heavy accent, the nigerian pronunciation thick and strong:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Onko then sheathed his knife, and the four other men suddenly appeared from
 quite unlikely and widespread places, from any one of which they could
 have put a bullet through Ethan at their leisure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded and made a small sigh, as if acknowledging he had indeed let
 his guard down and been overcome, exactly what he tought his recruits should
 never happen, not even while not in the battlefield.
 Cultivating a little paranoia went a long way in keeping a man alive, especiall
y in a civil war where telling a friend from an enemy was not as clean a
 business as shooting at one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan did manage to save some face though when he pointed at his feet to
 a small bump in the ground, leaves cluttered all over it and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See now Ibrahim, that's a mark for a landmine.
 You might have killed at least one man when you chose to fall back here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Onko seemed far from smiling at that comment, and with a mixed expression
 midpoint between anger and disappointment he said to Ethan, making it sound
 almost like an accusation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There was no place else to fall back and cover, Captain.
 It was a death trap then, for sure.
 What could we have done different? Not fair, sir.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word `sir' had a strange ring to it, and that probably was because it
 was meant to sound off-putting.
 Ethan only cared to answer briefly right before he turned about and started
 walking to the gathering area of the training field:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
In the warm light of neon orange, Ethan searched his pockets for the some
 small change, but to no avail.
 He rarely needed dimes and pennies when he made his cosmopolitan visits
 to the center of Lagos, but using the jukebox in Loui's bar was such an
 occasion, and even more so a favourite habit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, Ethan was not a rare visitor to Loui's establishment, and most
 would instantly recognise him.
 He was widely known as the Englishman, both to the few locals and the numerous
 extraordinary foreigners that frequented the Metropolitaine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan maintained that he only came for the regularly up-to-date jukebox,
 whilst his tab indicated a thirsty sort of music lover with a certain taste
 for fine malts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Malts such as the unusually fine scotch that Loui kept stashed for the well-off
 or even well-liked customer.
 He had simply decided to thank God there was good scotch to be found in
 a place like Nigeria and even more so in a bar like Loui's.
 To make the realisation even more mind-numbing for Ethan, there was good
 scotch to be found during what the Nigerian government chose to characterise
 as a `crisis'.
 The Metropolitaine's crude and shanty decoration, or more appropriately
 its blatant lack thereof only helped to somehow accentuate that a war was
 going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of ceiling fans still worked despite what one might expect at first
 sight, barely keeping the air from going stale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was with his usual wide grin that Louis, the proprietor, approached Ethan
 and offered him a penny before bowing slightly, impeccably dressed in a
 striped jacket, white pressed shirt, bowtie and smart pants, an air of
 the thirties Paris about him.
 Ethan accepted the coin gladly and immediately dropped it in the slot,
 while Louis chimed in his blatantly french but not unbearable accent:

Ethan smiled wryly and nodded while selecting a song in the jukebox, his
 index finger searching for the correct button to press.
 He pushed `Under my thumb', and turned to reply to Louis before setting
 off to settle in his usual barstool, the bar solely at his disposal at
 that hour:

 the bar.
 When he next spoke, it was with a feeling of relief:

 his regular customer for the past year or so with his usual air of cool

\begin_layout Standard
Louis shook his head in disappointment, and started polishing a basket full

 mixed feeling of sadness and slight aggravation, his movements lacking
 his usual crispness and finesse:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan kept wearing the same smile that had won him arguments on innumerable
 occasions, while he kept tapping his fingers to the rhythm of the song
 playing from the jukebox.
 After a short uncomfortable silence, he said to Louis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It must feel like a kick in the nuts, Louis, but remember, I'm doing you
 a favor.
 Take a look around you.
 There's bigger trouble than those two thugs.
 There's a war going on.
 If they do pop up and act like a couple of tough guvs, I'll make sure they

 No use worrying about it now.

\begin_layout Standard
Louis looked a bit distraught, his eyes somewhat dull from wariness.
 Ethan tried to change the subject:

What do you have for me this time? Auchentoshan? Glenfiddich? 
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Louis became his professional self again; he seemed to relax a bit, his
 tense mouth loosening into a tight smile.
 He reached for a tall cupboard with a lock on the handles, and used a small
 key that hung from a chain around his neck.
 He opened the cupboard with small, graceful movements of his hands, as
 if opening an icon or a shrine.
 In it, a dozen bottles of Littlemill sat, dusty and squat, seemingly quite
 authentic seal, cork and all.
 At the sight of the bottles of scotch and the prospect of savouring them
 at his leisure, Ethan's face lit up and his blue eyes seemed for a moment
 to sparkle.
 His voice couldn't contain his enthusiasm:
\end_layout

Littlemill? Thirty-two years old, triple distillation.

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was starting to get properly wound up when the door bell rang and
 attracted his attention.
 He looked up from his drink and saw Louis pointing with his long bony index
 finger to a sturdy, tall and fit black man dressed in fatigues, the beret
 of the Nigerian Marine Corps smartly adorning his head.
 The man's eyes peered vehemently through the haze and fog of the smoke
 and dust that seemed to always twirl lazily in the Metropolitaine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The soldier's gaze quickly settled on Ethan, who was spinning around on
 his barstool to look at the newcomer directly.
 He cracked a smile and gave a mocking half-salute to the burly man who
 - judging by his epaulets - appeared to be a brevet Major.
 The man did not seem to share the same good humor and did not salute, neither
 did he seem to enjoy smiles and levity a lot.
 As he approached the bar, Ethan's mood had swung again towards his sweet
 side and he cheerfully made a gesture at the still open cupboard full of
 Littlemill, greeting the man with a proposition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

James, this is a once in a lifetime chance for a once in a lifetime experience.
 It's Littlemill.
 It's the nectar of the Gods.
 It'll be monumental James; getting plastered with the finest scotch in
 the whole country, with little doubt.
 So, what is the unhappy occassion of your visit here in uniform? Tell me
 all about it so I can forget it with the help of Louis and Littlemill.
 Is it remotely serious? Are the Biafrans hurtling shells at Lagos? Can
 I go home now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heavily set man had a quite intimidating appearance.
 The capability of severely wounding a man armed with nothing but his hands
 was the usual first impression.
 At odds with his brutal image he had a strangely calm and serene demeanor,
 a grim look on his face that implied his mind was occupied with grave matters.
 He approached Ethan and taking off his beret he calmly said:

Business in the Metropolitaine was in full swing.
 A small gang of sailors were celebrating one of their mates birthday, following

 than that the orders kept coming in and that made him a happy man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was sitting opposite James at a small round metal table in a corner
 near the bar, looking far from jovial.
 What James had told him had suddenly turned this war into a personal matter,
 something that every professional soldier tried to avoid.
 A well-known but sadly overlooked factor in dying was doing stupid things
 for all the wrong reasons, and making a war something personal was both
 stupid and wrong.

\begin_layout Standard
James had fallen silent for a couple minutes silently sipping at his wine,
 a local plonk variety that barely passed the mark.

Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one go and made

 Though I still think it was a stupid thing to do, at least he acted like
 the man he's supposed to be.

There was a pause.
 Louis was returning to their table with Ethan's refill of Littlemill and
 a clean ashtray.
 Ethan nodded his thanks to Louis who in turn bowed slightly and fleeted
 off to serve some other table.
 James had rested his arms on their table, his frame too large to comfortably
 seat himself in the Metropolitaine's plain chairs.
 Ethan took a mouthful of Littlemill and flinched when he felt the malt
 burn down his throat and into his stomach.

Kenya, right.
 Nineteen sixty one.
 My squad had shipped out to Kenya as part of a counter-insurgency operation.
 The plan was to turn the various guerilla parties on each other, feeding
 disinformation and using scare tactics.
 We were supposed to make contact with a few loyalist bands, and organize
 a small force that would stop the insurrection in its heart.
 It was pretty complex, far-fetched and too optimistic.
 Very few men.
 No small wonder it failed.
 Of course that's not why we lost Kenya.

Ethan stopped for a moment when Loui came with James' new glass of wine.
 He picked up Ethan's empty glass and nodded with a wink, before leaving
 them alone once again.
 Somewhere in the opposite corner of the Metropolitaine a loud crashing
 noise was heard and Ethans fleeting gaze revealed the bunch of sailors
 strewn around over lots of broken glasses and a couple of upturned tables.
 A loud chorus of laughters was heard and once the noise resumed its regularly
 high levels, Ethan decided to go on:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

We were trying to rendezvous with a loyalist cell in the Ript Valley, scout
 out the area, evaluate targets and then organize a strike to disorganize
 and demoralise the local rebel cells.
 Guerilla warfare textbook case.
 Anyway, first couple of nights in the jungle, all fine and dandy; nothing
 but mosquitoes, fucking jungle weather and bad sleep, which was to be expected
 in the bloody jungle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
On the third night though, I woke up not with a kick in the me bollocks.
 I realise my hands are all tied up.
 Can't fucking believe what's going on; whole squad captured like a bunch
 of campers.
 The sentries were talking about the last fucking Millwall-Chelsea game.
 Long story short, we got caught with our pants down.
 They didn't kill us outright, that would have been stupid and of no use.
 The Kenyans needed leverage, public approval, anything that would convince
 the parliament to say `balls off with Kenya, it's not worth it'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We were eleven men on that squad.
 At first I thought they would exchange us, but then we noticed we were
 going around in circles somewhere near Lake Rudolf, nothing like a plan.
 Like a long range patrol or whatnot.
 Our heavy gunner, McKinley, tried to make a run for it one day.
 He stumbled and tripped, dropped twenty feet down a cliff and broke both
 his legs.
 Their leader, a big brute of a man, shot him in the back of the head.
 Even said he was being merciful.
 That was when fucking bells started ringing in our heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That cunt had it coming for him.
 We decided to have a go at them all together.
 We stopped for fresh water by a small river one day.
 While they were bathing, we ganged up on two of our guards.
 That's when I got stabbed in the knee and tore up the ligaments.
 Nobody died though.
 Except that man.
 I drowned that fucker.
 Held him down in the river till my hands turned blue and I couldn't feel
 them.
 First time I killed a man with my bare hands.
 We then hiked back through the jungle, the Kenyan's in tow.
 Debriefing them gave some insight into the area, but a fat lot of good
 that did in the end.
 I got a demerit for losing McKinley and getting captured.
 Should've been a major by now.

Once inside, he saw a man in his late fifties, short and miniscule.
 The man wore a thick mustache, had an almost completely bald scalp and
 a pair of old-fashioned ebony-rimmed glasses.
 The label on his desk read `Isidor Bloom - Director of Cultural Affairs'.
 He looked up from his seemingly casual reading material and immediately
 popped a smile.
 Even though they had only occassionally met at a couple of Embassy dinners,
 he offered his hand in a lively, warm way and said:

How do you do? Jolly good I hope, old friend.
 Please, do have a seat.
 Now, what was it that you wanted to speak to me about? I believe on the
 phone you said it was an urgent personal matter that somehow involved my
 desk.
 Would you care to elaborate? I can only be of real help if I know what
 we're dealing with here, dear fellow.
 In the strictest of confidence, of course.

Ethan shook the hand but still felt somehow a little out of depth, his inherent
 distrust of spies kicking in despite the man's cordial manner.
 Unaccustomed to protocol and etiquette, Ethan dived straight into the matter
 and said bluntly:

\begin_layout Standard
Before Ethan had time to elaborate, Mr.
 Bloom had furrowed his brow, waving a `no-no' finger at Ethan.
 He got up from his chair and leisurely closed the door of his office.
 Ethan could only frown with genuine puzzlement while Mr.
 Bloom sat down again comfortably, lit his smoking pipe and had a puff.
 He then asked Ethan while looking him directly in the eye, his gaze strangely
 unnerving:

Do you ask for a cunt when walking into a brothel, Mr.
 Whittmore? In such delicate matters, a little more room for maneuver is

 You'd ask for a girl or a woman, perhaps even some company.
 Not for a cunt, which what brothels have on offer.
 Are you following me, son?

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan looked ever more perplexed, especially by the sudden change of mood
 in the middle-aged man.
 He understood he had been too blunt, but while trying to think what to
 say next and especially how to apologise, the public servant leaned closer
 to Ethan before continuing:

Listen, old chap; everybody knows what we're doing here and everyone, including

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded numbly despite not actually understanding all too well what
 the man was trying to get at.
 Mr.
 Bloom saw the confusion written on Ethan's face and after sighing slightly,
 continued:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Right.
 Well then, let's make things easier for you, and expediate the process.
 Is there someone I can call on your behalf? Someone who can help me, help

At that, Ethan replied automatically, as if he had been waiting for that

Yes, sir.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As suddenly as before, Mr.
 Bloom's attitude switched back to his jovial, well-mannered and quite expedient
 self.
 Wearing an almost disconcertingly wide grin on his face, he picked up the
 phone on his desk, dialed a single number, and said:

A small wait ensued, which was reason enough for Ethan to start sweating
 even though the temperature inside the room was quite pleasant.
 Mr.

 the weird stressful feeling anxiety that had overcome Ethan.
 Mr.
 Bloom was then heard talking over the phone:

Hello? Leonard? Yes, it's me Isidor.
 Long time no see, but it's business again I'm afraid.

 Could you tell him to give me a call please? Yes, my office.
 Well, right about now would be indeed a perfect time.
 I'd like to get on with this before lunch.
 Yes, well she's fine, working on her garden and all that.
 How's Marie? Loved her cherry pie last Christmas, marvellous stuff really.
 Would love to, old chap.
 Have your man call me, alright then? Goodbye Leonard, don't forget to give

Once he hang up the phone, Mr.

Fucking cunt can sod off.
 Now, let's clear up a few things: This friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod
 off as well.
 If he's going to push something for me down my pipe, that's fine and all.
 I don't give fuckall about the why or how.
 Do you understand that? I'm going home to Cheltenham before Christmas,

 And just so that you know, the cock around here tastes awful so brush often

\begin_layout Standard
Mr.
 Bloom put out his pipe, placed it in his shirt pocket, picked up his hat
 and strolled out of his office, careful to smoothly close the door behind
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly had transpired.
 The only certainty was that Mr.
 Bloom had probably been for too long in the service.
 Ethan's thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing.
 Hesitating at first but then thinking it should be Ruthers on the other
 end of the phone line, Ethan picked up the receiver:

Hello? Ian? It's Ethan Whittmore.
 Well, what can I say? Didn't expect to hear me on this end, did you? What

 No, it wasn't -- I know I shouldn't be even talking to you like this but
 I need some help, Ian.
 No! I'm not married.
 Can you be serious for a minute? How you're working for Six I'll never
 understand.
 Well, now that I saw the guy in the Nigerian desk perhaps I do understand.
 Listen.
 Just listen.
 I need some cover.
 It's Andy, my brother.
 I need to go into Biafra.

James rolled a cigarette.
 Real imported tobacco, confiscated from Customs.
 A smile, a joke and a tap in the back usually go a long way.
 Especially when you're six feet tall and slightly less stocky than a bull.
 That was something that Ethan had said when they had first met.
 A piece of wisdom from Britain's finest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen table.
 A hefty fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly serrated set of
 tiny teeth.
 The smell of roast dominated the room and through an open window the grill
 on the small porch could be seen; a few coals were settling down, their
 heat meaningless in the suffocating summer night of Lagos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A wedding feast was being held down the next street, the gathered crowd
 milling about like a colourful circus troupe, dancing and singing with
 vigor despite everyone being thoroughly drenched in sweat.
 James peered at the small spectacle and stared blankly for a minute or
 two, as if his thoughts were completely disconnected with what was going
 on in front of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd brought the groom to the fore, the improptu stage the middle of
 the street, and made a circle around him.
 He was all dressed up, smiling brightly.
 Everyone showered him with flowers and small gifts, while they danced to
 a deep, rhythmic beat of drums.
 His face seemed to shine almost imperceptibly with a gold sheen that somehow
 looked only natural under the light of the torches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James' arm.
 He shook instinctively, ash marking the spot of the slight burn on his
 skin.
 His face didn't flinch though, nor did he seem to notice his cigarette
 was out.
 The phone in the bedroom was ringing with a mindless persistence that only
 a salesman would envy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When James finally got up from his chair, the phone was ringing again.
 He stormed outside dressed in nothing but his shorts and ran towards the
 moving wedding feast barefooted.
 As he ran, he ran his tongue across his lips but couldn't tell his tears
 from his sweat.

A somewhat plumb, blond-haired man with a scruffy look and a thin, wiry

Distasteful doctor's humor, Mr.

\begin_layout Standard
A number of people around them was busy loading the Land Rovers with all
 sorts of crates, bags, and sacks with everything from gauzes to canned
 food and flour.
 Ethan looked quite accustomed to the heat and the Nigerian sun, at odds
 with the stocky german doctor who seemed to be discomforted immensely,
 even though he tried his best not to show it.
 Ethan nodded with a sparkly grin and said:

The german doctor motioned with his pad to the paltry shade offered by a
 nearby tent filled with crates stamped with the sign of the Red Cross,
 and Ethan lead eagerly.
 The doctor replied:

Ethan put down his knapsack and welcomed the shade, settling on a crate.
 His eyes seemed suddenly old, staring outside at the crowd of volunteers

The doctor put down his pad on one of the crates, pulled a fold-up chair
 from a corner of the tent, spread it open and sat down, his relief obvious
 in the way he splayed his feed, heels on the dirt.
 He took a few short breaths before answering in a peculiar, thoughtful
 voice:

 worried:

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan crossed his arms against his chest, purely an instinctive defensive
 motion that only helped to show his nervousness.
 His charm didn't seem to work as intended, and his sly grin was his way
 of showing he genuinely liked the plumb Prussian doctor for his openness:

 pack of Camel's.
 He put one into his mouth and proferred one to Ethan as well, who politely

 The doctor got up from his seat, while searching around for something to
 light his cigarette.
 His reply came with a slightly muffled voice:

 his eyes squarely meeting Ethan's gaze before asking him straight:

Space inside the Land Rover was at a premium.
 Not an inch of space had gone to waste; it almost seemed like the passengers
 inside were intruding on the cargo space and not the other way around.
 Ethan had come up with a very comfortable-looking seating arrangement on
 top of a sack of rice, along with a wooden crate against his back and a
 couple of flour bags to put his feet up on.
 He and the doctor were riding along together at the rear of the small convoy
 of Land Rovers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig was sweating profusely, and kept dabbing his forehead and face with
 a small hand towel.
 It only made his suffering a little less unbearable and a little more obvious.
 Ethan had been sleeping on and off, the car's continuous jerks and road
 bumps having developed into a sort of lullaby.
 Their driver was invariably focused on the task at hand, barely uttering
 a word.
 Ludwig could not stop himself from asking, straining his voice to be heard
 over the roar of the diesel engine.
 Even though at previous times he hadn't received an answer he could make
 good use of yet, his pitch had an air of optimism about it:

Yes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig who would otherwise consider an endless talker a nuisance at best,
 appeared to be edging on aggravation.
 Olufemi's brusqueness felt like he was doing the doctor a favor by even
 considering an answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor made another effort to engage in conversation or at least learn
 some hopefully interesting information about their whereabouts:

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig nodded to himself, and tried to clear his parched throat with little
 success and barely a spit.
 Ethan had a contemplating look drawn upon his face, his gaze darting from
 bush to grove.
 He held his camera in hand, the inadvertent swarm of flies seemingly rather
 fond of him.
 Ludwig tried to get his attention, engage in some kind of discussion to
 relieve himself of the dullness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan turned to face Ludwig with a furrowed brow, and having been caught

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shrugged indifferently, effortlessly shooting down Ludwig's hopes.
 A prolonged silence followed once again, regularly interrupted by the creaks
 and croans of the Land Rover's chassis.
 As the evening wore by, flies began to give their place to mosquitoes.
 The grassy hills rushed by, lush with vegetation, filled with tall, thin
 trees and distant mangroves.
 The swampy savannah drew distant with every passing minute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan turned and addressed Olufemi in Yoruba with a ghastly accent, but
 decent enough to be understood.
 The driver suddenly burst into laughter and started talking vividly with
 Ethan.
 A torrential flow of Yoruba was intermixed with laughs, giggles and extravagant
 hand gestures.
 Ethan was responding in kind, and judging by his tone, sometimes asking,
 sometimes filling in and sometimes simply nodding.
 Olufemi even made eye contact with Ludwig once, before breaking down in
 laughter once more before finally being able to settle down to his invariably
 dull and sullen mood.
 Ludwig looked at Ethan with eyes that shone rather irregularly and a voice
 slightly reminiscent of gritted teeth:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd

The last word sounded unusually venomous for the good doctor.
 Ethan countered the doctor's irate mood with a radiating smile.
 He explained:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig raised his brow and nodded, right before instinctively slapping his
 arm, failing to kill a mosquito.
 Before Ludwig could have had the chance to retort in a manner unbecoming
 of a doctor, Olufemi suddenly cut in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

For a doctor.
 We dem almost there.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Both of them looked up ahead to where the road steered off course and into
 a dirt path that seemed to lead slowly upwards onto a small ridge.
 Ludwig asked then with barely conceiled exhilaration:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Olufemi gave a nod instead of answering properly, while Ethan was looking
 more and more at the sky, its rosy and purple hues lighting up the gathering
 clouds, dressing them in the imagery of cotton candy.
 While the last light could be seen falling around them, Ethan said with
 some disappointment:

 Ludwig retorted with a grin:

Visibility had been reduced to the car up ahead, and only thanks to the
 powerful headlights.
 The caravan was moving with a walking speed, carefully treading on a dirt-turne
d-into-mud path barely wide enough to call a road.
 Olufemi made some colourful remarks about the driving conditions, to which
 Ethan remarked they should be happy they weren't being shot at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig stabbed Ethan with a gaze unusually hard and firm for such a seemingly
 light-mannered man and asked him:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shrugged and before he had time to answer, a blinding flash lit the
 area in front of them and in the blink of an eye they felt the surging
 overpressure of a shockwave on their eardrums.
 A wall of dirt and mud seemed to go up in the air, lifting with it the
 chassis of the Rover in front of the column.
 Ethan's shouting was barely heard through buzzing eardrums:

Landmine! Stop, stop! Get out, now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi panicked and let go of the wheel, their car bumping on the Rover
 in front.
 The flaming debris of the destroyed Land Rover could be seen, lying on
 the edge of the road upturned and torn.
 Pandemonium ensued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What was that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ludwig asked with a slight tremor in his voice.
 The answer from Ethan came accompanied by a powerful shove:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Landmine or RPG! Now move! Out of the car! And stay low!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi was faster to comply, opening his door and rushing out, frantically
 searching for more flashes or explosions, but none came.
 Ludwig sloppily made his way out of the doors in the back of the Rover
 over the assorted bags and crates, while Ethan opened the window behind
 him and drew himself out in a fluid motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He shouted to the bewildered people in the caravan, some of which had already
 stepped outside their Rovers, dazed and confused:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Get out! Lay low and don't move!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's eyes were frantically looking for signs of movement in the torrential
 rain, the light from the headlamps the only source of illumination.
 There were no muzzle flashes, launch trails or smoke.
 Lots of shouting and confusion, but the characteristic hammering sound
 of AKs was absent.
 This was not an ambush.
 Ethan's voice took on an authoritative yet calming tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down.
 Stay put.
 No-one's shooting at us.
 It was a landmine.
 Tell the people next to you to calm down and stay put.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone was drenched to the bone.
 All around him, Ethan could see faces frozen in sheer terror, some of them
 shaking visibly.
 Olufemi had started shouting calls to the other drivers in Yoruba, when
 Ethan's instincts kicked in; he quickly walked over him and put a hand
 to his mouth.
 Olufemi was surprised and looked at Ethan sideways, giving him a look of
 frustrated fear.
 Ethan put one finger to his mouth while shaking his head, and let go of
 Olufemi's mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No shouting, not in Yoruba.
 Understand, mate? Not around these parts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi could only nod.
 Rather baffled though he was, he motioned with his hands to the other drivers
 who by now had his attention to `lay low'.
 With fear and hesitation as plentiful as the rain pouring down on them,
 the drivers complied, some of them already on their knees and praying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan felt the heavy rain on his head, tried to wash away everything else
 and focus on the moment.
 He needed to calmly tell these people what to do next, when Ludwig came
 up from behind him, the sound of his approach muffled by the rain and the
 din from the people in shock.
 Ethan's eye simply caught a shadow approaching.
 He twisted around sharply, grabbed Ludwig from one arm and place his foot
 to act as a pivot.
 Before having time to actually see Ludwig, he was already throwing him
 down to the dirt, still grabbing his arm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig splashed in the mud yelling, markedly scared and half-witted:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan breathed deeply, letting some of the adrenaline wear off before picking
 up Ludwig and offering his apologies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sorry I jumped on you.
 It's a conditioned reflex.

Ludwig could not help but shout irately:

\begin_layout Standard

 Someone fucked up the itinerary.
 Olufemi!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The driver turned and nodded.
 He looked shaken but he was evidently quick about his wits.
 Ethan leaned slightly towards him, shouting to be heard and pointing at
 the column of stopped rovers and the frightened crowd:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Step on the Rovers' tracks.
 Tell the rest of the drivers to get the people back inside.
 See if anyone's wounded, get the doctors working on them.
 We'll be safe as houses then.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi nodded and carefully started walking towards the first Rover, while
 the people were shouting out questions to noone in particular.
 Ethan started walking up the front of the column, carefully passing by
 people and telling everyone to be calm and emphasize that they were probably
 safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he reached the debris of the first Rover, he saw the people in the
 second car frozen still.
 They had bled out of their ears, probably deaf and scared to death.
 Ethan took a closer look: the driver was still clutching his wheel, all
 tensed up and in shock.
 The explosion had shattered the windshield, and along the water that had
 pooled inside there was what remained of a shattered, blown away arm.
 The driver had shattered fragments of glass all over his face, and his
 eyes were a bloody mess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shouted to Ludwig:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ludwig! Grab a first aid kit, and come up front! Face injury! Try and stay
 on the tire tracks!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig nodded affirmatively and disappeared in the back of the Rover.
 Ethan grabbed the blind man from one arm and told him nothing.
 He simply squeezed him gently and felt the man's blood pumping like a flooded
 river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once Ludwig arrived he shot a quick glance at the blown up vehicle, and
 quickly turned to say something to Ethan who shook his head in denial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not a chance, mate.
 I'm sorry.
 Enough explosives to throw five thousand pounds six feet in the air.
 It's a bloody miracle this one's lost just his eyes instead of his head.
 The others are in the back, scared shitless, a bit deaf probably but otherwise
 in one piece.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig nodded appreciatively and focused on the task at hand, trying not
 to think about the people in that first Rover.
 His motions were calm and professional, as if he was working in an examination
 room.
 Ethan urged him to hurry up, and took a few steps forward towards the small
 crater which had effortlessly turned into a pool.
 He took out a flashlight from one of his pants' pockets and a large leaf-shaped
 knife from an ankle belt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He crouched and slowly crept towards the pool, carefully studying the ground,
 digging in with the knife at seemingly random intervals.
 Going past the pool, his eyes avidly scanned the mud.
 Before long, even under the unabating rain and all the mess of debris he
 caught a glimpse of a dull olive-green shape barely protruding from the
 muddy ground.
 A careful prod at the rim with the knife let him know this was another
 landmine.
 A few feet to his right, he could make out the outline of another.
 A slow, careful sweep with the flashlight uncovered two more, less than
 ten feet apart.
 He slid back to the crater and got up, jogging back to Ludwig and the injured
 man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A certain amount of quiet and calm had started to settle among the crowd.
 Olufemi could be seen quietly exchanging concerned looks with the other
 drivers, some of them already back inside their Rovers, trying to find
 a dry smoke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a proper god-awful minefield,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan to Ludwig.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig was still dressing the eyes of the driver, after having administered
 some sedatives for the excruciating pain that would follow the end of the
 adrenaline rush.
 He was dripping wet, smeared with blood all over his hands and shirt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your deductive reasoning amazes me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the doctor, not bothering to hide the tone of irony.
 Ethan replied calmly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It could have been a single land mine, an old ambush site.
 No, this was a proper minefield, there's probably more of them around the
 bushes and trees.
 We need to go back.
 I don't know who decided on this itinerary, but it wasn't safe.
 Killed those people in the Rover, and it might have killed us all.
 Might still as well.
 We need to get moving out of here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig suddenly stopped tending to the wounded driver.
 He closed his eyes and seemed to whisper something in German.
 Ethan told him sternly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What are you blabbering about? They're dead, Ludwig.
 Come on now, pull it together.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

The doctor exploded with fury at Ethan, letting his utensils drop to the
 mud:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I picked the roads! It was me! So fuck you, Mr.
 Owls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan fell instantly silent, knowing there was nothing meaningful to say
 to the doctor.
 The next moment, the doctor was leaning on the side of the Rover, emptying
 his stomach involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi noticed the slight commotion, and came a bit closer to see.
 Ethan explained to Olufemi as he approached:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need to go back, around another way.
 It's probably best if we can stop for the night someplace near.
 Anything in mind?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi seemed to pause and think for a while, and then nodded with renewed
 vigor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 his voice ringing clear through the never-ending rain.

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig suddenly stood straight, hanging onto the Rover's door though, and
 said with a pale face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're going back.
 This caravan is no more.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Rivulets of rain ran freely down Ethan's taut face when he said with the
 slightest hint of irony:

 Olufemi, take point in our Rover.

 Doctor, seriously, grab a couple of sedatives yourself and just hang on.
 Alright?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig stared blankly at Ethan, while Olufemi hurried to spread the word
 to the other drivers.
 Ethan moved the driver in the co-driver's seat, and told a practically
 deaf nurse and a red cross volunteer with a broken arm that they were leaving
 now.
 At length, before he urged Ludwig to get in the Rover, the doctor asked
 him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you know what you're doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan felt odd suddenly.
 He had heard that same question probably a thousand times from a hundred
 different people, but somehow this time it sounded as different as it was
 familiar.
 And even though he felt naturally inclined to grin and answer `bloody hell
 no', he calmly said to the doctor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It will be alright now.
 Just get in the car with Olufemi, and try not to think.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor made his way to the Rover with a slouch, exhaustion drawn all
 over his face.
 Ethan got into the now vacant driver's seat and put the gear into reverse.
 He felt like he was turning into an accomplished liar, something he had
 thought he'd despise.
 Strangely enough, all he could think of was his bad leg.

Ludwig nodded his silent thanks to the sister who in turn smiled serenely
 and left the room with measured prudishness.
 A couple of oil lamps, one on a plain wooden shelf and another on an equally
 unadorned table gave off a warm light, accented at times by the flash of
 lightning pouring in through the small stained glass window.
 The glass added a reddish hue that seemed to have attracted Ethan's gaze
 like a moth to a fire, his face set in stone, perched inside the cups of
 his hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig took a cigarette from his pack, his hands still shaking.
 He was about to offer it to Ethan when he suddenly rose up from the small
 cot and blinked furiously as if awaking from a long, deep slumber of which
 he had no recollection.
 He asked Ludwig then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How is everyone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor lit the cigarette and stared outside the window, even though
 there was nothing to see but dark, pouring rain and a circus of fleeting,
 random shadows.
 His voice sounded unassumingly flat:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The driver is running a high fever.
 He's on antibiotics, and I though I removed as much of the shrapnel as
 I could under the circumstances.
 Nothing can be done about his hearing.
 Tartoovi and Donaldson have probably gone deaf for life.
 I had to sedate them.
 They're sleeping now.

A flash of lightning cast a freakish shadow in the small guestroom.
 A few moments passed before the sound of thunder rolled by, when Ludwig

Ethan gave the doctor a long hard stare.
 His eyes seemed to waver a little, while his visage remained stern and
 grave-looking.
 His voice was pitched lower than usual:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It happens after a while, doctor.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thunder reverberated inside the small chamber, the small flame in
 the oil lamp on the shelf trembling in tune.
 Ludwig put out his cigarette and took off his glasses.
 He reached into his pockets and produced a small piece of clean linen with
 which he started cleaning his glasses.
 Ethan started to say something when the doctor spoke to him without meeting
 his gaze:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ethan paused for a moment, and shrugged almost apologetically.
 He replied:

Ludwig's fist connected with Ethans cheekbone and stopped him mid-sentence.
 Before he slammed the frail door behind him as he left the room, Ludwig
 shouted in a fit of rage:

Emotional?! What would you know about emotions?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was caught off-guard, but recovered quickly enough.
 He rushed outside the small guestroom and onto an ill-lit corridor.
 Even as he started off to follow the doctor, a figure suddenly appeared
 to be blocking his way.
 He stopped and looked genuinely surprised when he saw a tall, slender woman
 sporting a look that could have bored a hole in his face.
 Subdued light poured off a small opening to her right.
 She was still holding the tattered curtain that served as a door when she
 sternly told Ethan:

The slap across Ethan's face came out almost out of nowhere.
 It jolted him back into the deep memory of a well-mannered childhood for
 only a tiny moment, and the accented yet quite clear voice served to reattach
 his awareness into the current state of affairs and a very irate woman:

 It had little effect:

I think I've wasted enough time with you already, Mr.

Ethan replied in a very serious tone, in an almost dangerous display of

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Would it do any good if I was carrying a rifle instead?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She paused for a moment, looking at Ethan with a set of piercing blue eyes
 that seemed to be trying to peer beyond those last few words of his: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We wouldn't even be talking if that was the case.
 Now please, haranguing me like that won't get you anywhere.
 I have much more pressing matters to attend to,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said and made to leave while Ethan's gaze floated around until it met her
 left arm, where a piece of gauze stuck out from under her sleeve.

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan just threw his hands in the air and said:

For God's sake, you haven't even given me a chance, right from the start.

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole was looking at him when she suddenly smiled ironically and said:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You think it's unfair?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan waved a hand above his head and replied: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This whole business is unfair to everyone here.
 Shouldn't you allow for some leeway, even when dealing with vultures?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She paused for a moment, as if measuring everything about Ethan with a casual
 glance from head to toe:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you want some leeway, and if you're willing to really apologize and make
 amends, then come lend a hand.
 You can carry things around without taking any pictures, can't you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, following her question up with a smile that might not have been
 as ironic as the first one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The lighting's all bad anyway,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I find your sense of humor out of place,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Nicole flatly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I try, but I always end up in the wrong place for some reason,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ethan and nodded to himself.
 Nicole replied with a frank voice:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're a complex man, Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan smiled thinly before he crossed his arms and said: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought I was a vulture.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't really change your mind, can I?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and shook his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she pulled the curtain to the nursing station aside, she showed the way
 inside and said with what seemed to her genuine smile: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can try.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Purple and red hues of dawn sheepishly tried to blossom far away, the earth
 still wet and napping, the chill humid breeze unusually refreshing.
 Nicole's gaze wandered around the monastery's rock and mud walls for a
 moment, before it focused on the bell towers.
 One was set facing the east, the other towards the Vatican; from the weary
 look on her face, both directions looked equally distant in any measureable
 way, whether it be space or time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan approached her casually without any hint of their former quarrelsome
 chat.
 He offered her a cigarette which she silently accepted.
 He lit it up, and they both sat on a stone wall near the wall, letting
 the morning wind carry away all the weight of the night before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Helping Nicole with her rounds had mellowed her somewhat to the point where
 she no longer considered him a vulture.
 Not only had she admitted being too quick to judge, but she had also been
 openly impressed by Ethan's quick-and-dirty first-aid knowledge, turning
 any simple item into a tourniquet or a splinter.
 It struck her as odd but Ethan had managed to explain that any journalist
 that wanted to get alive out of a warzone had to be a medic as well.
 She had smiled at that and said with just a hint of mischief: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

My, my; and you can type as well
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But nothing on her face that morning came close to that austere, quirky
 nurse with the outspoken dislike of journalists and other vermin that seemed
 to feed on human misery: As she sat there smoking, she struck Ethan as
 a very familiar face, someone close but yet so distant in memory.
 Like a long lost friend or perhaps, a lover.
 He kept trying to remember, and was soon enthralled by the warmth of her
 face, lost in his little own box of memories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she took another puff from her cigarette, she casually looked around
 and caught Ethan with his gaze fixated on her, his eyes out of focus.
 She asked him then, with just the right amount of disapproval in her soft
 voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anything you particularly like, Mr.
 Owls?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to which no answer came.
 She asked again, this time less pretentiously:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Richard? Lost somewhere?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, and broke the spell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hmm? Sorry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he finally managed to answer before he himself asked in earnest: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I must've been woolgathering, what were you saying?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole shrugged and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Nothing.
 You just stood there and kept looking at me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before she 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
added all high-browed yet smiling slightly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Looking for something in particular?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan smiled with a corner of his lip in a bitter fashion before exhaling,
 the smoke swiftly vanishing away in little curls and twists.
 He sounded somewhat reticent, weighed-down when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's a funny thing to ask; you could say I am, but it's not you.
 Though you do remind me of someone.
 I just can't put a name to it; it's a slippery thing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bells started to chime then; it was time for the morning prayer.
 A few sisters could be seen around the courtyard, hurriedly but quietly
 moving about for the mass.
 It struck Ethan as odd then how similar it all looked to a roll call: quiet,
 practiced, efficient.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Unto God's own image,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said then half to himself, while he pointed to the shuffling silhouettes
 of the nuns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole turned around to look and through a small window the first cautious
 rays of sunlight caused her to squint even though she sat in the shadow
 of the walls.
 She shook her head and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Such a waste,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before she put out her cigarette and folded her arms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan frowned and asked her: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You mean, the nuns?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She half-turned around to look at him, while warm sunlight made her hair
 glow as if from within and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I mean God.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan let out a small laugh before he said: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's a funny thing to say for someone working in a monastery.
 It's almost a joke, actually.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her eyes suddenly took on that earlier piercing glint that conveyed her
 annoyance instantly.
 She retorted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

'He' is the joke.
 It's just that people don't seem to get it, more often than not.
 In a sense, it's better that way.
 Imagine if these nuns used as forced labor, sold and exchanged like cattle.
 At least the lie the live in doesn't make things any worse.

Our camp was attacked.
 Tribal lords.
 Little more than feral men, they came one day and wanted to loot everything.
 Including the women.
 Some of us tried to put up a fight.
 Perhaps it was a mistake.
 During the shooting, some of us had the chance to run away.
 Some stayed behind, like my husband.
 He was already bleeding..
 He..
 He gave me this cross.
 He was a believer, you see.
 Funny, no?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tears welled in her eyes but she did not cry, even though it seemed like
 she should.
 Ethan saw how easily her facade of the strict, haughty nurse had crumbled
 away when she mentioned her husband.
 Thoughts about that camp ran around Ethan's head.
 A strange forlorn feeling of an idea formed up in his head.
 He asked her then in his most steady, thoughtful voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

May I see?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded and took off the cross that she had been wearing: it was a simple,
 unadorned silver St.
 Andrews cross.
 Ethan took it in his hand and it immediately felt more than familiar -
 he turned it around and he saw the letters 'A.N.W.' carved on the backside.
 Andy Nathaniel Whittmore.
 This was Andy's cross, and Nicole was his wife.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thoughts and wishes mingled in one as they raced to take control of his
 mouth.
 He tried but he couldn't remember the last time he had actually been at
 a loss.
 His face sat frozen in a frowned expression, unable to looke anything other
 than utterly confounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole saw that and couldn't help asking:

Your brother? That's ridiculous,

 she said and looked unabashedly dismissive.

He didn't give it a second thought.
 All the constructed facade he had went to some effort to create suddenly
 seemed completely worthless and immaterial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and took off his own twin cross and showed it to her.
 It wasn't as polished and there was a silver-grey patina all over it, but
 the initials 'E.R.W.' stood out clearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
