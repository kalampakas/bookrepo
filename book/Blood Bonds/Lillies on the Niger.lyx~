\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a radical departure from the first book, for which writing a sequel seems
 untimely or perhaps even unwanted, I'm writing Blood Bonds (working title).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The story is set during the Biafran-Nigerian civil war, or Biafran war of
 independence (depending on whose side you're on or on your POV), and especially
 in 1968.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main protagonist, and what is later revealed to be a tragic figure is
 Ethan Whittmore, a captain of the Royal Marines and a British military
 advisor in Lagos, Nigeria.
 Ethan Whittmore has served in Kenya doing commando and paramilitary work
 of a dubious nature, having done things he is loathe to talk about and
 not especially proud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Lagos he has befriended his Nigerian Liaison, James Dwele, a Major (?)
 in the Nigerian Army.
 Dwele's brother had fought in the Kenyan liberation struggle only a few
 years earlier, and had died at the very hands of Ethan.
 It was not until after they had become friends that James learned of Ethan's
 involvement, background and history.
 After an internal struggle he decided to wait in order to exact his revenge
 and did so in a methodical, cold and calculating manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Ethan's brother, Doctor Andy (Stanley?) Whittmore goes into Biafra
 with a Red Cross relief mission, Ethan tries to warn his brother and discourage
 him because of the dangers involved with going into a civil war.
 Andy is adamant and waves away his brother's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a couple of months though, all contact between Ethan and Andy is lost.
 James runs some checks with Intelligence and informs Ethan that the red
 cross camp had been raided, most possibly by a local warlord, but there
 was not a single body of a caucasian to be found, suggesting that they
 either fleed deep into the jungle, unable to get to a town for help, or
 had been kept as prisoners to be ransomed at some point in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The essence of it was that Andy was somewhere in the Biafran jungle, most
 probably alive, but certainly in danger, if not already dead and buried
 somewhere in the jungle with no hope of ever finding a body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan is torn between duty and love for his younger brother, and after being
 urged by James, he decides to abandon his posting, go AWOL and search for
 his brother.
 In that undertaking, he counts on the help of James who will provide him
 with an extraction helicopter when and if Ethan locates Andy, as well as
 updates via radio of the movement and disposition of Nigerian and Biafran
 forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan contacts an acquaintance in MI6, Ian Ruthers, a war buddy from Kenya
 who owes him a favor or two, and arranges an identity as a journalist attached
 to a red cross caravan going into Biafra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once he sets out (not from Lagos but from a large red cross camp near the
 borders) and goes through the jungle, on the second day of their trek they
 stop for supplies and rest at a French Catholic monastery, run by a few
 nuns, some French, some local converts.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole Heurgot, a nurse who claims was part of a red
 cross caravan that was attacked, and her fleet brought her to the relative
 sanctuary and safety of the monastery.
 When Ethan introduces himself as who he really is tells her he is looking
 for his brother, she says to him that not only she knew Andy and they where
 on the same caravan, but that they were also lovers and she fears he might
 be dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In truth, Nicole is a french agent, working in league with Andy.
 After she happens upon Ethan, she notifies Andy via radio (the monastery
 also doubles as a cache and forward post for french intelligence operations
 in the area which involve providing equipment to the biafrans) about Ethan's
 search.
 Andy tells Nicole to wrangle his brother around, buy some time until he
 sends some personal effects from their jungle hideout to a nearby town,
 so that they can cook up a badly charred white caucasian body that could
 be Andy, and convince Ethan that Andy is dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the meantime, Ethan contacts James and finds out that he could not cover
 for him effectively, and trying to fake his leave of absence did not work
 out.
 He has been marked as AWOL and a court-martial and certain stripping of
 rank awaits him when he returns.
 As far as the Nigerians are concerned, they fear he has turned over to
 the Biafrans, and is considered an enemy of the state to be shot on sight.
 With his own government washing its hands off him and the Nigerians who
 he had been training considering him a traitor, Ethan has nowhere to go
 back to.
 His only purpose and reason now is to find his brother, dead or alive,
 and then try to vanish somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At that point the monastery is attacked by a local warlord, and Ethan single
 handedly kills a couple of them as well as the warlord, but even though
 the rest of the bandits flee, many of the red cross men and women have
 been killed, and the rest refuse to go on and simply try to make it back
 to Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Without a valid cover Ethan then asks for Nicole's help, which she seems
 to give willingly, out of concern for Andy.
 When Ethan explains that there's nothing left for him behind, and while
 already on their way to the closest town past the borders, she reveals
 to Ethan that she is actually a British agent working under cover in Biafra,
 and she is confident that her network of agents will be able to at least
 find out if Andy is alive, and even perhaps his whereabouts.
 Not only that, but she is confident she can smuggle Ethan out of the country
 and perhaps clear his name, so that Ethan has one more reason to stick
 with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they arrive at the bordertown, they settle for the night in a shanty
 hotel.
 When Ethan wakes up, he finds out that Nicole has gone and has left him
 a note with some contacts whom he must talk with, and arranges a meeting
 in a safehouse, because of pressing business.
 In truth, Nicole left to arrange the duping of the body and the various
 contacts that are supposed to feed Ethan with false information, have him
 go around in circles only to have him find out his brother is dead in the
 morgue (a fake body).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While Nicole is away, Ethan in the back of his head is always alert and
 distrustful especially now that he believes the only man he can trust is
 James, and the only man who might actually have an escape route available.
 He contacts his MI6 man in dire need, asking to know whether or not there
 is a woman like Nicole working for the british in biafra.
 Though reluctantly, his buddy Ian tells him he'll have to do a search.
 He arranges it so that he passes a 'yes' or 'no' message via the BBC, the
 next night (perhaps a specific song, or a glitch in the clock beeps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The contact spot is a bar, where Ethan receives the message from BBC radio
 that Nicole is not who she claims she is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole, gives him the bad news that Andy is dead, his body in the morgue,
 charred and almost unrecognizable but for his dental fillings, harmonica
 and switchblade with his initials and Eton insignia (or whatnot).
 Ethan is convinced he is being lied to because his brother had a slightly
 smaller hip (or whatnot) that seemed okay in this body.
 Ethan does not openly express himself, but seems withdrawn and in mourning,
 while heavily contemplating his next move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole weeps convincingly enough, and says to Ethan that tomorrow morning
 she'll arrange passage for Ethan first to (african state bordering south
 nigeria) and then on to South Africa where he might have a better luck
 clearing his name with the army.
 For that night, they'll sleep together in the safehouse with the local
 biafran man that acts as her bodyguard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan times his attack well and catches the man off-guard.
 In the fight that ensues, the man is killed and Nicole gets away.
 Rummaging through the man's belongings he finds a few clues (key, receipts
 etc.) that lead him to expose Nicole's network as what it really is, a french
 network of agents.
 ONe of them also coughs up the location of the jungle HQ/hideout, where
 Ethan decides to go next, believing that he had been sidetracked on purpose,
 and a fake body of Andy was indeed proof that he was alive and certainly
 their prisoner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When he arrives at the site he finds out a red cross deserted camp, similar
 to what his brother's camp should have been.
 Trying to search for more clues, he is attacked suddenly and rendered unconscio
us, by his own brother Andy.
 When he wakes up he is restrained and Andy and Nicole are there , trying
 to explain to him that Andy is working for the French, and that they are
 a couple now, intent on getting married officially once their work in Biafra
 is done.
 Not only that, but Andy explains how he had grown disenchanted with the
 British imperialistic way of doing things, and that he genuinely believes
 he is helping Biafrans in their fight for independence and justice.
 Ethan says bollocks to all that, spits on his brother and can't believe
 he actually sold everything off to save a traitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They leave things at that and Andy tells his brother that he hopes he comes
 around soon or else there will be no place for him there and he would have
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In reality, Andy is a double agent working for MI6 (unbeknownst to Ian who
 could not have known that -- only handlers know such info), having infiltrated
 the French agency, supplying the british with detailed information about
 the plans and operations of the French, and waiting for the opportune time
 to bring all the french operations in Biafra to an end, effectively leaving
 the Biafrans without any outside help, and bringing the war one step closer
 to the end with the Nigerians and their friends the British on the winning
 end, awarding the oil contracts to the british.
 He arranges it so that Ethan can get out of his bonds and gives him a chance
 to escape unharmed and without alerting someone.
 That way he hopes that his brother will finally get away from his own affairs
 without jeopardising or hampering his mission, and with an added bonus,
 the french operations will be disrupted while they relocate their base
 of operations.
 The problem arises when Ethan does not think of it that way, and instead
 takes it upon himself to kill Nicole and as many French agents and collaborator
s as he can.
 When he kills Nicole, Andy is outraged: Ethan had terminated the efforts
 and work of many months with one stroke, at the wrong time.
 Andy tells him who he really is and Ethan is stunned, unable to believe.
 When he is told details and truths and shown his radio signals, Ethan finally
 believes his brother (with some good old look-me-in-the-eye fashion), and
 offers their route of escape, James.
 While they set some explosives to go off, at least maximizing the damage
 and then going off to the LZ, they are discovered and a small hunt begins,
 trying to save their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they finally reach the LZ and wait for the chopper to salvation, exchanging
 fire from a long distance, James is seen in the pilot's seat alone.
 When he touches down the chopper and the two brothers run towards it, he
 opens up the door and puts a bullet squarely through Andy's head.
 Ethan is stunned, and while James is pointing the gun at him, between tears
 and babbling, confused and overwhelmed by contrasting emotions, James retells
 Ethan how he has exacted his revenge by killing Ethan's brother, just like
 Ethan had killed his own a few years ago.
 Ethan gets into a fight with James and finally kills him.
 He is left alone in a jungle clearing with the chopper still whirring its
 blades slowly and the French still after him, his brother and his best
 friend dead beside him.

Chapter breakdown
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a training with Marines from the 3rd Marine Division, Ethan Whittmore
 is told by his friend James Dwele that he has had some news about his brother.
 Ethan had lost contact with his brother and had asked James to find out
 what he could, as he is the intelligence officer of the division Ethan
 is attached to as a military advisor.
 James and Ethan discuss what can be done about Andy, and Ethan proposes
 that he should go in search of his brother, bringing the example of James'
 brother who had died in Kenya and James himself was unable to help.
 Some of Ethan's exploits are discussed but he seems reluctant to talk about
 these, while James in effect traps Ethan into finding Andy so he can exact
 his revenge.
 James promises he will try and keep in touch with Ethan and they arrange
 codes and radio frequencies.
 James also says he will try to cover for Ethan but thinks that he will
 not be able to buy enought time.
 Ethan believes he can arrange a cover, and does so via a friend in the
 MI6, Ian Ruthers.
 By the end of the chapter, James and Ethan shake hands and Ethan starts
 off with the caravan, a few range rovers, local volunteers and red cross
 personnel from various countries, while his cover is Richard Owls, a journalist
 for the London Times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Well met on an ill road
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The next couple of days pass rather languidly, the backdrop of the civil
 war and the jungle scenery featuring prominently until the caravan stops
 at a catholic monastery for supply and rest, as well as local info that
 should help them to avoid fighting and reach their intended destination
 (some local town) with relative safety.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole, and he finds out some direct info about his
 brother, believing at first that Nicole is indeed a nurse who had a relationshi
p with his brother.
 By the end of the chapter, Nicole is seen contacting Andy discussing a
 course of action, revealing her identity as an French agent to the reader,
 as well as seeing that the monastery is a cache/hideout for the French
 and an exchange point for Biafrans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Right before setting out the next day, at dawn, the monastery is attacked
 by a local warlord and his group of bandits (just because he had found
 out that Biafrans are supplied from such a place and equipment and ammo
 can be found there).
 The red cross caravan is cut down by fire, while Ethan puts his skills
 to use, and after most of the personnel is dead, and while the bandits
 begin their search for the cache, Ethan cuts the throat of the warlord,
 arms himself with an assault rifle and through hiding and shooting, takes
 down more than a couple of bandits, the rest of which decide things are
 already going badly for them, and flee into the jungle.
 After the firefight, Ethan helps with the bodies after which the nuns that
 are left alive pack their few belongings and decide to leave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Heed no prayer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The caravan is now non-existent and the few survivors terrified rush back
 to Nigeria.
 Ethan has no cover now, and while thinking ways of reaching Biafra through
 the jungle, Nicole acts according to plan, which is to safely remove Ethan
 from the picture.
 Knowing his brother would go after him no matter what, Andy had arranged
 for Nicole to set up the fake body, and while they would do that, wank
 him around a border town searching for clues that lead nowhere except the
 fake dead body of Andy, the idea being that Ethan would have thought his
 brother dead.
 Nicole then in order to perform that plan tells him that she is in fact
 a british agent (and perhaps that the cache that Ethan saw etc.
 was an english cache), and that her network of agents can help Ethan with
 hisn quest, so they set out together, to arrive the next couple of days
 to the small bordertown of LALA.
 During the trip through the jungle they witness the horrors of civil war,
 and while Nicole takes a humanist approach to the subject, she is seen
 knowing a lot about the politics involved in the matter (the oil fields
 etc.).
 Ethan seems focused on finding his brother and comes across as somewhat
 cynical and distant concerninc war and its atrocities.
 By the end of the chapter, they arrive at the small town, and sleep.
 When Ethan wakes up he finds the note with the contacts and a rendezvous
 point.
 He then thinks about what he had discussed with Nicole earlier and believes
 there's something awry with her (though she has detailed knowledge of Andy,
 she puts him off), and decides to phone Ian once more.
 Ian is disturbed by what Ethan tells him has happened, and promises to
 find out or whether or not there's an agent like Nicole in the area.
 Because he will be unable to safely deliver the message otherwise, he'll
 arrange something through the BBC (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 - something from their wartime past probably - a yes or no).

 Dead men can't dance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(this is the part where Ethan learns he is now considered AWOL, a turncoat
 for the biafrans etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole's contacts are pretty worthless, feeding Ethan disinformation, and
 making him go around in circles, finding out nothing new about his brother.
 By the time the rendezvous with Nicole comes up, it's 9 o'clock and it
 is now revealed to Ethan that Nicole is not who she claims to be.
 He keeps his cools and believes he is being lied to on purpose so that
 he cannot find his brother.
 When Nicole informs him his brother is in the morgue on LARGER_TOWN he
 believes there's something very rotten going on.
 He decides to hop along Nicole and some local who is both muscle and local
 expert, part of the supposed network.
 They go to the morgue and Ethan is shown the charred remains of an unidentified
 caucasian the same height and apparent bodyweight as his brother, with
 the correct fillings and some personal effects like his switchblade, pocket
 watch etc.
 Ethan for a few moments believes he might have erred, but then notices
 his brother's leg is not a bit shorter than the other, a birth defect that
 was almost imperceptible.
 He then notices an exposed collarbone that seemed perfectly shaped while
 his brother had cracked it at a small age, and it should have been noticeable.
 Thus Ethan now has proof that Nicole is indeed someone else and actively
 trying to divert him away from Andy.
 In tears she proposes that Ethan has nothing to do other than bury his
 brother tomorrow, and go home while there's still time to clear his name,
 something she promises she'll help with.
 Ethan plays along and they leave for a house that belonged to the local
 man (Adu Nebdele), and served as a place where they could use for operating
 (truthfully, as their french base of operations in LARGER_TOWN).
 At night, Ethan pretends to be sleeping and while prowling around the house,
 Adu catches him having found the radio creche and while at first he Acts
 as if nothing's wrong, when Ethan notices signals decoded/to be sent in
 french and british movement and nigerian charts, a fight ensues and Nicole
 wakes up.
 Ethan swiftly kills Adu and Nicole escapes him.
 He decides to take action and starts to round up the so-called network,
 while Nicole flees to contact Andy in person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
6.
 Blood thin as water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan starts to terrorize the various contacts he had met before.
 Some yield the small value of info that they had been instructed to mislead
 him, some run before he can catch them, some die while trying to kill him
 and one of them is tortured and confesses the location of the french hideout
 in the jungle.
 Ethan travels to the location on foot only to find out it is an abandoned
 (the abandoned most possibly) red cross camp of his brother.
 While searching he finds out that the camp was a decoy and that there was
 a hidden underground entrance near a waterfall.
 Right before he tries to enter the complex, he is struck unconscious by
 his brother, and dragged inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
7.
 When Ethan wakes up, he is restrained to a chair, noticing the knots can
 be loosened over a few hours.
 He is not hurt, and his brother Andy and Nicole are trying to explain that
 they had simply tried to avoid him finding out Andy is an agent for the
 French, working in Biafra in order to help the biafrans achieve independence,
 and promote French interests in the oil industry.
 He and Nicole try to convince to work for them as well, and provide detailed
 info and feedback on British-Nigerian practices and plans, as well as train
 Biafrans to have an advantage over the Nigerians.
 Ethan refuses vehemently, Nicole is frustrated, and Andy leaves Ethan to
 think it over.
 In fact, Andy has arranged the knots to be easy to loose and a ready escape
 route for Ethan so he can get out of there alive and noe be part of the
 picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Instead Ethan decides to go after them both, and going into commando mode,
 kills Nicole while at the same time Andy sees him do it.
 By the end of the chapter, Andy is seen pointing a gun at Ethan calling
 him an idiot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
8.
 Andy explains to ethan that he is a double agent working for the British,
 feeding disinformation to the French, and trying to find the opportune
 time to blow up their whole operations in Biafra.
 Ethan is hard to believe it but in the end believes his brother and the
 proof he shows him.
 Now that everything has gone tits up, Ethan says he can still save them,
 and arrange an extraction via James.
 While he does so, their cover is blown and they start running for their
 lives, while the ETA is about an hour.
 In the ensuing firefights around the camp, some if it is blown off and
 then they start the run inside the jungle to the LZ.
 When the chopper finally arrives, the french are hot in their heels.
 James touches down, shoots Andy, tells Ethan the truth about him and his
 brother, Ethan kills him and is left with the chopper and the French behind
 him.

\begin_layout Chapter
In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sweat ran freely down the red-haired Englishman's temples, smearing the
 jungle camo on his clean-shaven face.
 A knife blade covered in dry mud sat in his left hand, while his other
 hand made a rough circle in the air.
 It was a hand signal for the command to encircle the target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five men melted away into the green humid jungle in a heartbeat, as if they
 had been an optical illusion.
 They moved fast; faster than what Ethan had believed them capable of.
 He decided to stand back for a little while more, and see how they could
 handle their approach on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of them stopped dead in their tracks and hunched low when they heard
 noise, probably from the direction of the clearing up ahead.
 The two men that formed the edge of the squad aimed their rifles outwards
 from the squad, as if a switch had been thrown.
 The point man laid himself flat with the silken grace of a cat, knife drawn
 in his right hand while his left hand reached out for his Browning nine
 millimeter.
 The rearguard moved like a pair of dancers, covering each other's back,
 both aiming their rifles from shoulder-high, safeties clicked off to single-sho
t selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that cautious small diamond formation they moved as a whole, each step
 forward made with practiced ease and well-earned confidence, the mark of
 a well-trained soldier.
 For all intends and purposes, and as far as Ethan was concerned, he had
 done a good job training them.
 What did bother him though was that they had yet to fire a shot in anger.
 He knew that nothing tests a man like real combat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though they moved precisely as they had been taught, and seemed quick and
 stealthy enough, Ethan couldn't really tell if they just went through the
 motions or if they were really up for the challenge.
 After all, no matter how much one practices before a show, it's the opening
 night that makes or breaks it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's free hand was wrapped tightly around a metal L-shaped trigger attached
 to a small box no larger than a pack of cigarettes, from which a run of
 cables protruded and got lost somewhere under the rich jungle tapestrie
 of green and brown.
 With a tight grin, Ethan whispered to himself with the expectation of a
 job well done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Showtime, lads.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he double-clicked the trigger the first thing that attracted everyone's
 attention were the flashes.
 And then came the shockwaves, their force pummeling at everyone, making
 every ribcage vibrate intensely as if tremors had seized them.
 And that was just the opening note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small gun fire erupted from various well-placed locations, the muzzle flashes
 dotting the lavish scenery as if hundreds of photographers clicked in rapid
 succession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scouts instantly dived for cover, falling prone while keeping their
 arcs of fire fimly fixed to their own particular zone of responsibility.
 A wry smile formed on Ethan's face: he seemed to be enjoying the performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five trainees were on their bellies, rolling and crawling over the jungle
 bed in an effort to find as much cover as possible in mere moments.
 They exchanged quick glances and made repetitive hand motions to each other,
 communicating silently trying to establish a point where they could fall
 back away from the guns blazing at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every tree trunk and low bush or gully counted for gold at times like these,
 and the five Marine scouts from the 3rd Marine division made excellent
 use of their surroundings.
 Very much so that Ethan felt a twang of pride at seeing his handiwork in
 action.
 They were his men, and they seemed every bit as professional as he intended
 them to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They quickly abandoned their exposed position for a slightly shallow depression
 with good cover, fat tree trunks strewn around them with thick bush for
 cover and a clear view on all sides.
 A defendable position from which they could easily spot a move against
 them and fall back while they harassed their enemy firing and moving in
 turns.
 Ethan's mind flashed with the sudden realisation they were good enough
 to be Royal Marine scouts, not just Nigerian troops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost felt a hint of regret he couldn't be there with them when it really
 mattered, when the guns pointing towards them were not loaded with blanks;
 when the explosive charges half a mile away were real shells and mortars
 falling right on them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost, as Ethan reminded himself inside his head, was the eminent keyword:
 This was not his war, not by a far chance, and setting up mock engagements
 such as this one was as close as he wanted to get to another warzone.
 Except for the times when he itched, except for the times he woke up in
 the middle of the night drenched in sweat, knowing it wasn't the tropical
 heat that left him sleepless thereafter, but faces all too well remembered
 and defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team of five men had dug themselves in taking solid cover.
 The gunfire died down soon afterwards, and Ethan believed there was no
 point in continuing tracking and crossing the jungle.
 He had seen what he wanted to see, and that was a team of scouts, not a
 bunch of gung-ho Nigerians hollering with rifles raised firing on auto,
 vying for Igbo blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan raised himself above the brushes and bellowed as if he wanted the
 cadets back at Sandhurst to hear him clear as rain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

End of session! Fine job lads!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team of five gave no sign of sight or sound that they had heard their
 instructor.
 Ethan repeated himself with less enthusiasm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, games' over! Let's head back for some rest, off we go.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, nothing could be now heard other than the usual sounds of the jungle,
 the distant cries of birds and monkeys, and the constant buzzing of mosquitoes
 and other assorted exotic insects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan furrowed his brow and briefly considered that the team might have
 actually extracted themselves without him noticing, and decided to check
 the small depression himself.
 With a hurried pace, he made his way through the brush and in a few moments
 reached the position he had last seen them take cover in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw noone, but suddenly felt a piece of metal poking him through his
 left side, right between his ribs, poised to pierce his heart at a single
 thrust.
 He had been caught unawares, and once he looked sideways to his assailant,
 he saw Onko, the team scout leader smiling wildly, his bright white teeth
 a stark contrast to his camouflaged dark face.
 A little stunned and a little bit surprised, Ethan barely had time to let
 off a curse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger me, you've grown into a real scout Idowu.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No longer wearing the same disarming smile, the nigerian marine responded
 with a heavy accent, the nigerian pronunciation thick and strong:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You grow soft, Captain Whittmore.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Onko then sheathed his knife, and the four other men suddenly appeared from
 quite unlikely and widespread places, from any one of which they could
 have put a bullet through Ethan at their leisure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded and made a small sigh, as if acknowledging he had indeed let
 his guard down and been overcome, exactly what he tought his recruits should
 never happen, not even while not in the battlefield.
 Cultivating a little paranoia went a long way in keeping a man alive, especiall
y in a civil war where telling a friend from an enemy was not as clean a
 business as shooting at one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan did manage to save some face though when he pointed at his feet to
 a small bump in the ground, leaves cluttered all over it and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See now Ibrahim, that's a mark for a landmine.
 You might have killed at least one man when you chose to fall back here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Onko seemed far from smiling at that comment, and with a mixed expression
 midpoint between anger and disappointment he said to Ethan, making it sound
 almost like an accusation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There was no place else to fall back and cover, Captain.
 It was a death trap then, for sure.
 What could we have done different? Not fair, sir.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word `sir' had a strange ring to it, and that probably was because it
 was meant to sound off-putting.
 Ethan only cared to answer briefly right before he turned about and started
 walking to the gathering area of the training field:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
In the warm light of neon orange, Ethan searched his pockets for the some
 small change, but to no avail.
 He rarely needed dimes and pennies when he made his cosmopolitan visits
 to the center of Lagos, but using the jukebox in Loui's bar was such an
 occasion, and even more so a favourite habit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, Ethan was not a rare visitor to Loui's establishment, and most
 would instantly recognise him.
 He was widely known as the Englishman, both to the few locals and the numerous
 extraordinary foreigners that frequented the Metropolitaine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan maintained that he only came for the regularly up-to-date jukebox,
 whilst his tab indicated a thirsty sort of music lover with a certain taste
 for fine malts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Malts such as the unusually fine scotch that Loui kept stashed for the well-off
 or even well-liked customer.
 He had simply decided to thank God there was good scotch to be found in
 a place like Nigeria and even more so in a bar like Loui's.
 To make the realisation even more mind-numbing for Ethan, there was good
 scotch to be found during what the Nigerian government chose to characterise
 as a `crisis'.
 The Metropolitaine's crude and shanty decoration, or more appropriately
 its blatant lack thereof only helped to somehow accentuate that a war was
 going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of ceiling fans still worked despite what one might expect at first
 sight, barely keeping the air from going stale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was with his usual wide grin that Louis, the proprietor, approached Ethan
 and offered him a penny before bowing slightly, impeccably dressed in a
 striped jacket, white pressed shirt, bowtie and smart pants, an air of
 the thirties Paris about him.
 Ethan accepted the coin gladly and immediately dropped it in the slot,
 while Louis chimed in his blatantly french but not unbearable accent:
\end_layout

Ethan smiled wryly and nodded while selecting a song in the jukebox, his
 index finger searching for the correct button to press.
 He pushed `Under my thumb', and turned to reply to Louis before setting
 off to settle in his usual barstool, the bar solely at his disposal at
 that hour:

 the bar.
 When he next spoke, it was with a feeling of relief:

\begin_layout Standard
Louis shook his head in disappointment, and started polishing a basket full

 His eyes were fixed to the task at hand when he replied to Ethan with a
 mixed feeling of sadness and slight aggravation, his movements lacking
 his usual crispness and finesse:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan kept wearing the same smile that had won him arguments on innumerable
 occasions, while he kept tapping his fingers to the rhythm of the song
 playing from the jukebox.
 After a short uncomfortable silence, he said to Louis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It must feel like a kick in the nuts, Louis, but remember, I'm doing you
 a favor.
 Take a look around you.
 There's bigger trouble than those two thugs.

 If they do pop up and act like a couple of tough guvs, I'll make sure they

 No use worrying about it now.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Louis looked a bit distraught, his eyes somewhat dull from wariness.
 Ethan tried to change the subject:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Louis became his professional self again; he seemed to relax a bit, his
 tense mouth loosening into a tight smile.
 He reached for a tall cupboard with a lock on the handles, and used a small
 key that hung from a chain around his neck.
 He opened the cupboard with small, graceful movements of his hands, as
 if opening an icon or a shrine.
 In it, a dozen bottles of Littlemill sat, dusty and squat, seemingly quite
 authentic seal, cork and all.
 At the sight of the bottles of scotch and the prospect of savouring them
 at his leisure, Ethan's face lit up and his blue eyes seemed for a moment
 to sparkle.
 His voice couldn't contain his enthusiasm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was starting to get properly wound up when the door bell rang and
 attracted his attention.
 He looked up from his drink and saw Louis pointing with his long bony index
 finger to a sturdy, tall and fit black man dressed in fatigues, the beret
 of the Nigerian Marine Corps smartly adorning his head.
 The man's eyes peered vehemently through the haze and fog of the smoke
 and dust that seemed to always twirl lazily in the Metropolitaine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The soldier's gaze quickly settled on Ethan, who was spinning around on
 his barstool to look at the newcomer directly.
 He cracked a smile and gave a mocking half-salute to the burly man who
 - judging by his epaulets - appeared to be a brevet Major.
 The man did not seem to share the same good humor and did not salute, neither
 did he seem to enjoy smiles and levity a lot.
 As he approached the bar, Ethan's mood had swung again towards his sweet
 side and he cheerfully made a gesture at the still open cupboard full of
 Littlemill, greeting the man with a proposition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

James, this is a once in a lifetime chance for a once in a lifetime experience.
 It's Littlemill.
 It's the nectar of the Gods.
 It'll be monumental James; getting plastered with the finest scotch in
 the whole country, with little doubt.
 So, what is the unhappy occassion of your visit here in uniform? Tell me
 all about it so I can forget it with the help of Louis and Littlemill.
 Is it remotely serious? Are the Biafrans hurtling shells at Lagos? Can
 I go home now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heavily set man had a quite intimidating appearance.
 The capability of severely wounding a man armed with nothing but his hands
 was the usual first impression.
 At odds with his brutal image he had a strangely calm and serene demeanor,
 a grim look on his face that implied his mind was occupied with grave matters.
 He approached Ethan and taking off his beret he calmly said:

Business in the Metropolitaine was in full swing.
 A small gang of sailors were celebrating one of their mates birthday, following

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was sitting opposite James at a small round metal table in a corner
 near the bar, looking far from jovial.
 What James had told him had suddenly turned this war into a personal matter,

 A well-known but sadly overlooked factor in dying was doing stupid things

James had fallen silent for a couple minutes silently sipping at his wine,

Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one go and made
 a gesture with his empty glass to Louis who seemed to notice almost immediately.

 by the small bit of white that surrounded them.
 He tried to calm himself and find the appropriate words:

 Louis was returning to their table with Ethan's refill of Littlemill and
 a clean ashtray.
 Ethan nodded his thanks to Louis who in turn bowed slightly and fleeted
 off to serve some other table.
 James had rested his arms on their table, his frame too large to comfortably
 seat himself in the Metropolitaine's plain chairs.
 Ethan took a mouthful of Littlemill and flinched when he felt the malt
 burn down his throat and into his stomach.

Kenya, right.
 Nineteen sixty one.
 My squad had shipped out to Kenya as part of a counter-insurgency operation.
 The plan was to turn the various guerilla parties on each other, feeding
 disinformation and using scare tactics.
 We were supposed to make contact with a few loyalist bands, and organize
 a small force that would stop the insurrection in its heart.
 It was pretty complex, far-fetched and too optimistic.
 Very few men.
 No small wonder it failed.
 Of course that's not why we lost Kenya.

Ethan stopped for a moment when Loui came with James' new glass of wine.
 He picked up Ethan's empty glass and nodded with a wink, before leaving
 them alone once again.
 Somewhere in the opposite corner of the Metropolitaine a loud crashing
 noise was heard and Ethans fleeting gaze revealed the bunch of sailors
 strewn around over lots of broken glasses and a couple of upturned tables.
 A loud chorus of laughters was heard and once the noise resumed its regularly
 high levels, Ethan decided to go on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We were trying to rendezvous with a loyalist cell in the Ript Valley, scout
 out the area, evaluate targets and then organize a strike to disorganize
 and demoralise the local rebel cells.
 Guerilla warfare textbook case.
 Anyway, first couple of nights in the jungle, all fine and dandy; nothing
 but mosquitoes, fucking jungle weather and bad sleep, which was to be expected
 in the bloody jungle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
On the third night though, I woke up not with a kick in the me bollocks.
 I realise my hands are all tied up.
 Can't fucking believe what's going on; whole squad captured like a bunch
 of campers.
 The sentries were talking about the last fucking Millwall-Chelsea game.
 Long story short, we got caught with our pants down.
 They didn't kill us outright, that would have been stupid and of no use.
 The Kenyans needed leverage, public approval, anything that would convince
 the parliament to say `balls off with Kenya, it's not worth it'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We were eleven men on that squad.
 At first I thought they would exchange us, but then we noticed we were
 going around in circles somewhere near Lake Rudolf, nothing like a plan.
 Like a long range patrol or whatnot.
 Our heavy gunner, McKinley, tried to make a run for it one day.
 He stumbled and tripped, dropped twenty feet down a cliff and broke both
 his legs.
 Their leader, a big brute of a man, shot him in the back of the head.
 Even said he was being merciful.
 That was when fucking bells started ringing in our heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That cunt had it coming for him.
 We decided to have a go at them all together.
 We stopped for fresh water by a small river one day.
 While they were bathing, we ganged up on two of our guards.
 That's when I got stabbed in the knee and tore up the ligaments.
 Nobody died though.
 Except that man.
 I drowned that fucker.
 Held him down in the river till my hands turned blue and I couldn't feel
 them.
 First time I killed a man with my bare hands.
 We then hiked back through the jungle, the Kenyan's in tow.
 Debriefing them gave some insight into the area, but a fat lot of good
 that did in the end.
 I got a demerit for losing McKinley and getting captured.
 Should've been a major by now.

The British embassy in Lagos stood out as the typical colonial building
 of the Africas, resplendent and austere, an indubitable legacy from the
 golden years of the Empire.
 Its tall, thin windows shone with the brightness of the noon sun when Ethan
 walked through the front gate saluting the guard on duty only perfunctorily.
 He ran straight up the stairs to the 2nd floor, simply ignoring any and
 all who tried to be of assistance.
 The door of the Director of Cultural Affairs office was half-open.
 Ethan knocked briskly and entered without waiting for an answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once inside, he saw a man in his late fifties, short and miniscule.
 The man wore a thick mustache, had an almost completely bald scalp and
 a pair of old-fashioned ebony-rimmed glasses.
 The label on his desk read `Isidor Bloom - Director of Cultural Affairs'.
 He looked up from his seemingly casual reading material and immediately
 popped a smile.
 Even though they had only occassionally met at a couple of Embassy dinners,
 he offered his hand in a lively, warm way and said:

How do you do? Jolly good I hope, old friend.
 Please, do have a seat.
 Now, what was it that you wanted to speak to me about? I believe on the
 phone you said it was an urgent personal matter that somehow involved my
 desk.
 Would you care to elaborate? I can only be of real help if I know what
 we're dealing with here, dear fellow.
 In the strictest of confidence, of course.

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shook the hand but still felt somehow a little out of depth, his inherent
 distrust of spies kicking in despite the man's cordial manner.
 Unaccustomed to protocol and etiquette, Ethan dived straight into the matter
 and said bluntly:

Mr.
 Bloom, I need a cover.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Before Ethan had time to elaborate, Mr.
 Bloom had furrowed his brow, waving a `no-no' finger at Ethan.
 He got up from his chair and leisurely closed the door of his office.
 Ethan could only frown with genuine puzzlement while Mr.
 Bloom sat down again comfortably, lit his smoking pipe and had a puff.
 He then asked Ethan while looking him directly in the eye, his gaze strangely
 unnerving:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do you ask for a cunt when walking into a brothel, Mr.
 Whittmore? In such delicate matters, a little more room for maneuver is
 usually required.
 You'd ask for a girl or a woman, perhaps even some company.
 Not for a cunt, which what brothels have on offer.
 Are you following me, son?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan looked ever more perplexed, especially by the sudden change of mood
 in the middle-aged man.
 He understood he had been too blunt, but while trying to think what to
 say next and especially how to apologise, the public servant leaned closer
 to Ethan before continuing:
\end_layout

Listen, old chap; everybody knows what we're doing here and everyone, including

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded numbly despite not actually understanding all too well what
 the man was trying to get at.
 Mr.
 Bloom saw the confusion written on Ethan's face and after sighing slightly,
 continued:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Right.
 Well then, let's make things easier for you, and expediate the process.
 Is there someone I can call on your behalf? Someone who can help me, help

\begin_layout Standard
At that, Ethan replied automatically, as if he had been waiting for that
 question for some time:

Yes, sir.
 That would be Ian Ruthers, a personal friend.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As suddenly as before, Mr.
 Bloom's attitude switched back to his jovial, well-mannered and quite expedient
 self.
 Wearing an almost disconcertingly wide grin on his face, he picked up the
 phone on his desk, dialed a single number, and said:
\end_layout

Hello? Jenny? Put me through to Bristol.

A small wait ensued, which was reason enough for Ethan to start sweating
 even though the temperature inside the room was quite pleasant.
 Mr.
 Bloom kept smiling and nodding in a reassuring fashion, which only accentuated
 the weird stressful feeling anxiety that had overcome Ethan.
 Mr.
 Bloom was then heard talking over the phone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Hello? Leonard? Yes, it's me Isidor.
 Long time no see, but it's business again I'm afraid.
 Is Ruthers one of yours? I see.

 Could you tell him to give me a call please? Yes, my office.
 Well, right about now would be indeed a perfect time.
 I'd like to get on with this before lunch.
 Yes, well she's fine, working on her garden and all that.
 How's Marie? Loved her cherry pie last Christmas, marvellous stuff really.
 Would love to, old chap.
 Have your man call me, alright then? Goodbye Leonard, don't forget to give
 my regards.
 Goodbye.

Once he hang up the phone, Mr.
 Bloom surprised Ethan once again with his choice of words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fucking cunt can sod off.
 Now, let's clear up a few things: This friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod
 off as well.
 If he's going to push something for me down my pipe, that's fine and all.
 I don't give fuckall about the why or how.
 Do you understand that? I'm going home to Cheltenham before Christmas,
 and this desk can rot on my piss.
 And just so that you know, the cock around here tastes awful so brush often
 and have a care with that mouth of yours.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mr.
 Bloom put out his pipe, placed it in his shirt pocket, picked up his hat
 and strolled out of his office, careful to smoothly close the door behind
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly had transpired.
 The only certainty was that Mr.
 Bloom had probably been for too long in the service.
 Ethan's thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing.
 Hesitating at first but then thinking it should be Ruthers on the other
 end of the phone line, Ethan picked up the receiver:

Hello? Ian? It's Ethan Whittmore.
 Well, what can I say? Didn't expect to hear me on this end, did you? What

 No, it wasn't -- I know I shouldn't be even talking to you like this but
 I need some help, Ian.
 No! I'm not married.
 Can you be serious for a minute? How you're working for Six I'll never
 understand.
 Well, now that I saw the guy in the Nigerian desk perhaps I do understand.
 Listen.
 Just listen.
 I need some cover.
 It's Andy, my brother.
 I need to go into Biafra.
 No joke.
 There will be no widow to comfort, so stop being a cunt and help me over

James rolled a cigarette.
 Real imported tobacco, confiscated from Customs.
 A smile, a joke and a tap in the back usually go a long way.
 Especially when you're six feet tall and slightly less stocky than a bull.
 That was something that Ethan had said when they had first met.
 A piece of wisdom from Britain's finest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen table.
 A hefty fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly serrated set of
 tiny teeth.
 The smell of roast dominated the room and through an open window the grill
 on the small porch could be seen; a few coals were settling down, their
 heat meaningless in the suffocating summer night of Lagos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A wedding feast was being held down the next street, the gathered crowd
 milling about like a colourful circus troupe, dancing and singing with
 vigor despite everyone being thoroughly drenched in sweat.
 James peered at the small spectacle and stared blankly for a minute or
 two, as if his thoughts were completely disconnected with what was going
 on in front of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd brought the groom to the fore, the improptu stage the middle of
 the street, and made a circle around him.
 He was all dressed up, smiling brightly.
 Everyone showered him with flowers and small gifts, while they danced to
 a deep, rhythmic beat of drums.
 His face seemed to shine almost imperceptibly with a gold sheen that somehow
 looked only natural under the light of the torches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James' arm.
 He shook instinctively, ash marking the spot of the slight burn on his
 skin.
 His face didn't flinch though, nor did he seem to notice his cigarette
 was out.
 The phone in the bedroom was ringing with a mindless persistence that only
 a salesman would envy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When James finally got up from his chair, the phone was ringing again.
 He stormed outside dressed in nothing but his shorts and ran towards the
 moving wedding feast barefooted.
 As he ran, he ran his tongue across his lips but couldn't tell his tears
 from his sweat.

A somewhat plumb, blond-haired man with a scruffy look and a thin, wiry

Distasteful doctor's humor, Mr.

\begin_layout Standard
A number of people around them was busy loading the Land Rovers with all
 sorts of crates, bags, and sacks with everything from gauzes to canned
 food and flour.
 Ethan looked quite accustomed to the heat and the Nigerian sun, at odds
 with the stocky german doctor who seemed to be discomforted immensely,
 even though he tried his best not to show it.
 Ethan nodded with a sparkly grin and said:

The german doctor motioned with his pad to the paltry shade offered by a
 nearby tent filled with crates stamped with the sign of the Red Cross,
 and Ethan lead eagerly.
 The doctor replied:

Ethan put down his knapsack and welcomed the shade, settling on a crate.
 His eyes seemed suddenly old, staring outside at the crowd of volunteers

The doctor put down his pad on one of the crates, pulled a fold-up chair
 from a corner of the tent, spread it open and sat down, his relief obvious
 in the way he splayed his feed, heels on the dirt.
 He took a few short breaths before answering in a peculiar, thoughtful
 voice:

 worried:

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan crossed his arms against his chest, purely an instinctive defensive
 motion that only helped to show his nervousness.
 His charm didn't seem to work as intended, and his sly grin was his way
 of showing he genuinely liked the plumb Prussian doctor for his openness:

The doctor reached into his sweat-stained shirt's pocket and procured a
 pack of Camel's.
 He put one into his mouth and proferred one to Ethan as well, who politely
 nodded his refusal, the grin unwaveringly attached on his tanned face.
 The doctor got up from his seat, while searching around for something to
 light his cigarette.
 His reply came with a slightly muffled voice:

Space inside the Land Rover was at a premium.
 Not an inch of space had gone to waste; it almost seemed like the passengers
 inside were intruding on the cargo space and not the other way around.
 Ethan had come up with a very comfortable-looking seating arrangement on
 top of a sack of rice, along with a wooden crate against his back and a
 couple of flour bags to put his feet up on.
 He and the doctor were riding along together at the rear of the small convoy
 of Land Rovers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig was sweating profusely, and kept dabbing his forehead and face with
 a small hand towel.
 It only made his suffering a little less unbearable and a little more obvious.
 Ethan had been sleeping on and off, the car's continuous jerks and road
 bumps having developed into a sort of lullaby.
 Their driver was invariably focused on the task at hand, barely uttering
 a word.
 Ludwig could not stop himself from asking, straining his voice to be heard
 over the roar of the diesel engine.
 Even though at previous times he hadn't received an answer he could make
 good use of yet, his pitch had an air of optimism about it:

Yes.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig who would otherwise consider an endless talker a nuisance at best,
 appeared to be edging on aggravation.
 Olufemi's brusqueness felt like he was doing the doctor a favor by even
 considering an answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor made another effort to engage in conversation or at least learn
 some hopefully interesting information about their whereabouts:

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig nodded to himself, and tried to clear his parched throat with little
 success and barely a spit.
 Ethan had a contemplating look drawn upon his face, his gaze darting from
 bush to grove.
 He held his camera in hand, the inadvertent swarm of flies seemingly rather
 fond of him.
 Ludwig tried to get his attention, engage in some kind of discussion to
 relieve himself of the dullness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That camera..

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan turned to face Ludwig with a furrowed brow, and having been caught
 unawares asked rather plainly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shrugged indifferently, effortlessly shooting down Ludwig's hopes.
 A prolonged silence followed once again, regularly interrupted by the creaks
 and croans of the Land Rover's chassis.
 As the evening wore by, flies began to give their place to mosquitoes.
 The grassy hills rushed by, lush with vegetation, filled with tall, thin
 trees and distant mangroves.
 The swampy savannah drew distant with every passing minute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan turned and addressed Olufemi in Yoruba with a ghastly accent, but
 decent enough to be understood.
 The driver suddenly burst into laughter and started talking vividly with
 Ethan.
 A torrential flow of Yoruba was intermixed with laughs, giggles and extravagant
 hand gestures.
 Ethan was responding in kind, and judging by his tone, sometimes asking,
 sometimes filling in and sometimes simply nodding.
 Olufemi even made eye contact with Ludwig once, before breaking down in
 laughter once more before finally being able to settle down to his invariably
 dull and sullen mood.
 Ludwig looked at Ethan with eyes that shone rather irregularly and a voice
 slightly reminiscent of gritted teeth:
\end_layout

The last word sounded unusually venomous for the good doctor.
 Ethan countered the doctor's irate mood with a radiating smile.
 He explained:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig raised his brow and nodded, right before instinctively slapping his
 arm, failing to kill a mosquito.
 Before Ludwig could have had the chance to retort in a manner unbecoming
 of a doctor, Olufemi suddenly cut in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

For a doctor.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Both of them looked up ahead to where the road steered off course and into
 a dirt path that seemed to lead slowly upwards onto a small ridge.
 Ludwig asked then with barely conceiled exhilaration:

Olufemi gave a nod instead of answering properly, while Ethan was looking
 more and more at the sky, its rosy and purple hues lighting up the gathering
 clouds, dressing them in the imagery of cotton candy.
 While the last light could be seen falling around them, Ethan said with
 some disappointment:

 Ludwig retorted with a grin:

As Ludwig joined him, the small droplets rapidly grew into a proper tropical
 storm, causing even Olufemi to exclaim:

Ethan was about to translate when Ludwig made himself heard over the din

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visibility had been reduced to the car up ahead, and only thanks to the
 powerful headlights.
 The caravan was moving with a walking speed, carefully treading on a dirt-turne
d-into-mud path barely wide enough to call a road.
 Olufemi made some colourful remarks about the driving conditions, to which
 Ethan remarked they should be happy they weren't being shot at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig stabbed Ethan with a gaze unusually hard and firm for such a seemingly
 light-mannered man and asked him:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shrugged and before he had time to answer, a blinding flash lit the
 area in front of them and in the blink of an eye they felt the surging
 overpressure of a shockwave on their eardrums.
 A wall of dirt and mud seemed to go up in the air, lifting with it the
 chassis of the Rover in front of the column.
 Ethan's shouting was barely heard through buzzing eardrums:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Landmine! Stop, stop! Get out, now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi panicked and let go of the wheel, their car bumping on the Rover
 in front.
 The flaming debris of the destroyed Land Rover could be seen, lying on
 the edge of the road upturned and torn.
 Pandemonium ensued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What was that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ludwig asked with a slight tremor in his voice.
 The answer from Ethan came accompanied by a powerful shove:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Landmine or RPG! Now move! Out of the car! And stay low!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi was faster to comply, opening his door and rushing out, frantically
 searching for more flashes or explosions, but none came.
 Ludwig sloppily made his way out of the doors in the back of the Rover
 over the assorted bags and crates, while Ethan opened the window behind
 him and drew himself out in a fluid motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He shouted to the bewildered people in the caravan, some of which had already
 stepped outside their Rovers, dazed and confused:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Get out! Lay low and don't move!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's eyes were frantically looking for signs of movement in the torrential
 rain, the light from the headlamps the only source of illumination.
 There were no muzzle flashes, launch trails or smoke.
 Lots of shouting and confusion, but the characteristic hammering sound
 of AKs was absent.
 This was not an ambush.
 Ethan's voice took on an authoritative yet calming tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Calm down.
 Stay put.
 No-one's shooting at us.
 It was a landmine.
 Tell the people next to you to calm down and stay put.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone was drenched to the bone.
 All around him, Ethan could see faces frozen in sheer terror, some of them
 shaking visibly.
 Olufemi had started shouting calls to the other drivers in Yoruba, when
 Ethan's instincts kicked in; he quickly walked over him and put a hand
 to his mouth.
 Olufemi was surprised and looked at Ethan sideways, giving him a look of
 frustrated fear.
 Ethan put one finger to his mouth while shaking his head, and let go of
 Olufemi's mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No shouting, not in Yoruba.
 Understand, mate? Not around these parts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi could only nod.
 Rather baffled though he was, he motioned with his hands to the other drivers
 who by now had his attention to `lay low'.
 With fear and hesitation as plentiful as the rain pouring down on them,
 the drivers complied, some of them already on their knees and praying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan felt the heavy rain on his head, tried to wash away everything else
 and focus on the moment.
 He needed to calmly tell these people what to do next, when Ludwig came
 up from behind him, the sound of his approach muffled by the rain and the
 din from the people in shock.
 Ethan's eye simply caught a shadow approaching.
 He twisted around sharply, grabbed Ludwig from one arm and place his foot
 to act as a pivot.
 Before having time to actually see Ludwig, he was already throwing him
 down to the dirt, still grabbing his arm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig splashed in the mud yelling, markedly scared and half-witted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's me! It's me! Scheisse!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan breathed deeply, letting some of the adrenaline wear off before picking
 up Ludwig and offering his apologies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sorry I jumped on you.
 It's a conditioned reflex.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ludwig could not help but shout irately:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Just so happens, yes.
 Never mind that, we need to get these people off the road.
 Someone fucked up the itinerary.
 Olufemi!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The driver turned and nodded.
 He looked shaken but he was evidently quick about his wits.
 Ethan leaned slightly towards him, shouting to be heard and pointing at
 the column of stopped rovers and the frightened crowd:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Step on the Rovers' tracks.
 Tell the rest of the drivers to get the people back inside.
 See if anyone's wounded, get the doctors working on them.
 We'll be safe as houses then.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi nodded and carefully started walking towards the first Rover, while
 the people were shouting out questions to noone in particular.
 Ethan started walking up the front of the column, carefully passing by
 people and telling everyone to be calm and emphasize that they were probably
 safe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he reached the debris of the first Rover, he saw the people in the
 second car frozen still.
 They had bled out of their ears, probably deaf and scared to death.
 Ethan took a closer look: the driver was still clutching his wheel, all
 tensed up and in shock.
 The explosion had shattered the windshield, and along the water that had
 pooled inside there was what remained of a shattered, blown away arm.
 The driver had shattered fragments of glass all over his face, and his
 eyes were a bloody mess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shouted to Ludwig:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ludwig! Grab a first aid kit, and come up front! Face injury! Try and stay
 on the tire tracks!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig nodded affirmatively and disappeared in the back of the Rover.
 Ethan grabbed the blind man from one arm and told him nothing.
 He simply squeezed him gently and felt the man's blood pumping like a flooded
 river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once Ludwig arrived he shot a quick glance at the blown up vehicle, and
 quickly turned to say something to Ethan who shook his head in denial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not a chance, mate.
 I'm sorry.
 Enough explosives to throw five thousand pounds six feet in the air.
 It's a bloody miracle this one's lost just his eyes instead of his head.
 The others are in the back, scared shitless, a bit deaf probably but otherwise
 in one piece.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig nodded appreciatively and focused on the task at hand, trying not
 to think about the people in that first Rover.
 His motions were calm and professional, as if he was working in an examination
 room.
 Ethan urged him to hurry up, and took a few steps forward towards the small
 crater which had effortlessly turned into a pool.
 He took out a flashlight from one of his pants' pockets and a large leaf-shaped
 knife from an ankle belt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He crouched and slowly crept towards the pool, carefully studying the ground,
 digging in with the knife at seemingly random intervals.
 Going past the pool, his eyes avidly scanned the mud.
 Before long, even under the unabating rain and all the mess of debris he
 caught a glimpse of a dull olive-green shape barely protruding from the
 muddy ground.
 A careful prod at the rim with the knife let him know this was another
 landmine.
 A few feet to his right, he could make out the outline of another.
 A slow, careful sweep with the flashlight uncovered two more, less than
 ten feet apart.
 He slid back to the crater and got up, jogging back to Ludwig and the injured
 man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A certain amount of quiet and calm had started to settle among the crowd.
 Olufemi could be seen quietly exchanging concerned looks with the other
 drivers, some of them already back inside their Rovers, trying to find
 a dry smoke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a proper god-awful minefield,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan to Ludwig.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig was still dressing the eyes of the driver, after having administered
 some sedatives for the excruciating pain that would follow the end of the
 adrenaline rush.
 He was dripping wet, smeared with blood all over his hands and shirt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Your deductive reasoning amazes me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the doctor, not bothering to hide the tone of irony.
 Ethan replied calmly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It could have been a single land mine, an old ambush site.
 No, this was a proper minefield, there's probably more of them around the
 bushes and trees.
 We need to go back.
 I don't know who decided on this itinerary, but it wasn't safe.
 Killed those people in the Rover, and it might have killed us all.
 Might still as well.
 We need to get moving out of here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig suddenly stopped tending to the wounded driver.
 He closed his eyes and seemed to whisper something in German.
 Ethan told him sternly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are you blabbering about? They're dead, Ludwig.
 Come on now, pull it together.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor exploded with fury at Ethan, letting his utensils drop to the
 mud:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I picked the roads! It was me! So fuck you, Mr.
 Owls!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan fell instantly silent, knowing there was nothing meaningful to say
 to the doctor.
 The next moment, the doctor was leaning on the side of the Rover, emptying
 his stomach involuntarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi noticed the slight commotion, and came a bit closer to see.
 Ethan explained to Olufemi as he approached:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We need to go back, around another way.
 It's probably best if we can stop for the night someplace near.
 Anything in mind?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Olufemi seemed to pause and think for a while, and then nodded with renewed
 vigor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Yes, dey is a mission,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 his voice ringing clear through the never-ending rain.

 replied Olufemi with a very peculiar and untimely grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig suddenly stood straight, hanging onto the Rover's door though, and
 said with a pale face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're going back.
 This caravan is no more.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Rivulets of rain ran freely down Ethan's taut face when he said with the
 slightest hint of irony:
\end_layout

Signed the papers, didn't they? Listen, this is fuckall, alright? You can't

 Olufemi, take point in our Rover.
 I'll drive this one.
 Doctor, seriously, grab a couple of sedatives yourself and just hang on.
 Alright?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig stared blankly at Ethan, while Olufemi hurried to spread the word
 to the other drivers.
 Ethan moved the driver in the co-driver's seat, and told a practically
 deaf nurse and a red cross volunteer with a broken arm that they were leaving
 now.
 At length, before he urged Ludwig to get in the Rover, the doctor asked
 him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do you know what you're doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan felt odd suddenly.
 He had heard that same question probably a thousand times from a hundred
 different people, but somehow this time it sounded as different as it was
 familiar.
 And even though he felt naturally inclined to grin and answer `bloody hell
 no', he calmly said to the doctor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It will be alright now.
 Just get in the car with Olufemi, and try not to think.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor made his way to the Rover with a slouch, exhaustion drawn all
 over his face.
 Ethan got into the now vacant driver's seat and put the gear into reverse.
 He felt like he was turning into an accomplished liar, something he had
 thought he'd despise.
 Strangely enough, all he could think of was his bad leg.

Ludwig nodded his silent thanks to the sister who in turn smiled serenely
 and left the room with measured prudishness.
 A couple of oil lamps, one on a plain wooden shelf and another on an equally
 unadorned table gave off a warm light, accented at times by the flash of
 lightning pouring in through the small stained glass window.
 The glass added a reddish hue that seemed to have attracted Ethan's gaze
 like a moth to a fire, his face set in stone, perched inside the cups of
 his hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig took a cigarette from his pack, his hands still shaking.
 He was about to offer it to Ethan when he suddenly rose up from the small
 cot and blinked furiously as if awaking from a long, deep slumber of which
 he had no recollection.
 He asked Ludwig then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How is everyone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor lit the cigarette and stared outside the window, even though
 there was nothing to see but dark, pouring rain and a circus of fleeting,
 random shadows.
 His voice sounded unassumingly flat:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The driver is running a high fever.
 He's on antibiotics, and I though I removed as much of the shrapnel as
 I could under the circumstances.
 Nothing can be done about his hearing.
 Tartoovi and Donaldson have probably gone deaf for life.
 I had to sedate them.
 They're sleeping now.
 The rest, some small cuts, bruises and the occasional dislocation or sprain.

A flash of lightning cast a freakish shadow in the small guestroom.
 A few moments passed before the sound of thunder rolled by, when Ludwig
 managed to speak again:

Ethan gave the doctor a long hard stare.
 His eyes seemed to waver a little, while his visage remained stern and
 grave-looking.
 His voice was pitched lower than usual:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It happens after a while, doctor.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thunder reverberated inside the small chamber, the small flame in
 the oil lamp on the shelf trembling in tune.
 Ludwig put out his cigarette and took off his glasses.
 He reached into his pockets and produced a small piece of clean linen with
 which he started cleaning his glasses.
 Ethan started to say something when the doctor spoke to him without meeting
 his gaze:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It seems you have everything worked out.

Ethan paused for a moment, and shrugged almost apologetically.
 He replied:
\end_layout

If you think it'll make you feel better, then by all means.
 I'm not your problem though.

Ludwig's fist connected with Ethans cheekbone and stopped him mid-sentence.
 Before he slammed the frail door behind him as he left the room, Ludwig
 shouted in a fit of rage:

Emotional?! What would you know about emotions?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was caught off-guard, but recovered quickly enough.
 He rushed outside the small guestroom and onto an ill-lit corridor.
 Even as he started off to follow the doctor, a figure suddenly appeared
 to be blocking his way.
 He stopped and looked genuinely surprised when he saw a tall, slender woman
 sporting a look that could have bored a hole in his face.
 Subdued light poured off a small opening to her right.
 She was still holding the tattered curtain that served as a door when she
 sternly told Ethan:
\end_layout

For God's sake, be quiet!

\begin_layout Standard
The slap across Ethan's face came out almost out of nowhere.
 It jolted him back into the deep memory of a well-mannered childhood for
 only a tiny moment, and the accented yet quite clear voice served to reattach
 his awareness into the current state of affairs and a very irate woman:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It is my business, and I'm not anyone's sister! These people need peace

It was a verbal attack; even though her voice was kept low at all times

Purple and red hues of dawn sheepishly tried to blossom far away, the earth
 still wet and napping, the chill humid breeze unusually refreshing.
 Nicole's gaze wandered around the monastery's rock and mud walls for a
 moment, before it focused on the bell towers.
 One was set facing the east, the other towards the Vatican; from the weary
 look on her face, both directions looked equally distant in any measureable
 way, whether it be space or time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan approached her casually without any hint of their former quarrelsome
 chat.
 He offered her a cigarette which she silently accepted.
 He lit it up, and they both sat on a stone wall near the wall, letting
 the morning wind carry away all the weight of the night before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Helping Nicole with her rounds had mellowed her somewhat to the point where
 she no longer considered him a vulture.
 Not only had she admitted being too quick to judge, but she had also been
 openly impressed by Ethan's quick-and-dirty first-aid knowledge, turning
 any simple item into a tourniquet or a splinter.
 It struck her as odd but Ethan had managed to explain that any journalist
 that wanted to get alive out of a warzone had to be a medic as well.
 She had smiled at that and said with just a hint of mischief: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But nothing on her face that morning came close to that austere, quirky
 nurse with the outspoken dislike of journalists and other vermin that seemed
 to feed on human misery: As she sat there smoking, she struck Ethan as
 a very familiar face, someone close but yet so distant in memory.
 Like a long lost friend or perhaps, a lover.
 He kept trying to remember, and was soon enthralled by the warmth of her
 face, lost in his little own box of memories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As she took another puff from her cigarette, she casually looked around
 and caught Ethan with his gaze fixated on her, his eyes out of focus.
 She asked him then, with just the right amount of disapproval in her soft
 voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Anything you particularly like, Mr.

 She asked again, this time less pretentiously:

 she said, and broke the spell.

Hmm? Sorry.

 he finally managed to answer before he himself asked in earnest: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole shrugged and said,

Ethan smiled with a corner of his lip in a bitter fashion before exhaling,
 the smoke swiftly vanishing away in little curls and twists.
 He sounded somewhat reticent, weighed-down when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bells started to chime then; it was time for the morning prayer.
 A few sisters could be seen around the courtyard, hurriedly but quietly
 moving about for the mass.
 It struck Ethan as odd then how similar it all looked to a roll call: quiet,
 practiced, efficient.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Nicole turned around to look and through a small window the first cautious
 rays of sunlight caused her to squint even though she sat in the shadow
 of the walls.
 She shook her head and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Her eyes suddenly took on that earlier piercing glint that conveyed her
 annoyance instantly.
 She retorted:

'He' is the joke.
 It's just that people don't seem to get it, more often than not.

 I'd made a bet, I could get my mates a bottle of sacramental wine.
 When Father Mulcahey got wind off the missing bottle, he roused us out
 of bed.
 He asked nicely which one of lads did it.
 I was about to take the punishment and the hail marys that went along with
 it, when Andy steps out front, says he was the culprit.
 Everyone else goes back to sleep, and then the father calls us both into
 the office.
 I was thinking we were going to get a beating either way.
 Instead, he opens up this little box and offers us a set of crosses.
 Makes us wear them and take a vow.

I met a man today who posed as a journalist by the name of Richard Owls.
 Long story short, he says he's your brother, Ethan.
 We were talking, and showed him your cross, playing the widow part.
 Thought your death might look good on a paper.
 He showed me a cross with his initials on it, E.R.W.
 He also told me about Father Mulcahey's sacramental wine.
 Is it really him? Strong, red-haired fellow.
 Has these piercing blue eyes.
 Medium height.

\begin_layout Chapter
Blood-red dawn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hills around the monastery blossomed golden under the first rays of
 the sun.
 The cold, wet night edged away, hiding under the jungle's treetops.
 The bell of the monastery started to ring, calling for the morning prayer.
 A few of the sisters started to gather in the small temple, rosemary in
 hand.
 Their lips moved at a shallow, serene pace, mouthing hymns and eulogies
 to their God, Lord and Savior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan had been awake before the break of dawn.
 He was watching the small procession from a small, paneless window.
 The night had been small but courteous; nothing but the distant sounds
 of wildlife had bothered him.
 Again, his sleep was dreamless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a knock on the door; the stars above shone their last light for
 the night.
 Ludwig stepped hesitantly inside, holding two cups of tea; it his way of
 apologizing.
 Ethan offered him a cigarette in kind.
 They sat together in the small room.
 Ethan sat upright in his bed cot, Ludwig pulled the single chair.
 They left their cups of tea to slowly cool on the window sill.
 When the break of dawn came they were still silent, trying not to think.
 Ludwig cleared his throat, breaking the uneasy silence:

 Ludwig went on:

\begin_layout Standard
Silence ensued between them.
 The sound of chanting rose suddenly out of the temple's open doors just
 as the first rays of the sun melted away the morning haze around the small
 patches of greenery.
 The heat was building up rapidly; soon they would be sweating again.
 Ethan suddenly turned and looked Ludwig straight in the eye.
 There was a frown on the doctor's face, a mixed expression of fear and
 hope.
 Ash from his cigarette fell on the dirt floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

My name's Ethan.

 Ethan replied and offered his hand.
 Ludwig smiled, the lines on his face wrinkling in a fatherly fashion.
 As they shook hands, they heard a dull but disturbing, faint echoing sound
 that Ethan recognised all too well: a gunshot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Gunfire?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan just nodded and rushed to the doorway to peek outside.
 He could see through the wide open monastery gate.
 In the distance, he could make out a couple of open-top Rovers slowly coming
 up the hill.
 A barrage of rattling sounds echoed around the hills; assault rifles on
 full auto.
 They were soon lost behind the first turn on the hillside.
 The gunfire went on, echoing faintly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Some kind of firefight,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ethan said to Ludwig as he reached for his backpack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Government or rebels?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ludwig with startled apprehension, as he took a look for himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Probably neither.
 Rebels wouldn't be so frivolous with their ammo.
 Government troops would have a column of vehicles, squads of men fanned
 out on the roadside, carriers.
 That sort of thing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not really important.

 Ethan said as he pulled out a Browning High Power pistol from his backpack
 and drived home a clip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You have a gun?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ludwig, as if he had never imagined he'd see one up close.
 Ethan loaded a bullet in the chamber and clicked the safety on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's American but it'll do nicely.

 If all goes well, I'll try and meet up with you by morning.
 If not, wait it out another day before coming back,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ethan with a grave expression.
 The echoes of gunfire grew apart in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What? That's preposterous, we can't leave everything behind! What are you
 saying?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ludwig, arms raised in dubious protest.
 Another rattling sound echoed, this time stronger; closer than before.
 The sound of motors revved up high could be heard, faintly but clearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig hesitated for just a single moment, but then ran to the door.
 He barely paused in his stride to ask:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What about the wounded, and the sisters? What about you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan wiped the sweat of his forehead, gun in hand: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll sell them bastards a front-page story they can't refuse.
 I'll do my best, promise.
 If it comes to it..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and nodded at the gun.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now go!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted.
 Ludwig nodded and ran off.
 He could be heard rousing people, urging them to put on their boots and
 just follow him.
 Dumbfounded, groggy voices mixed with the shuffling of feet, thuds and
 protests.
 From the sound of it though, they were on the move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gunshots could be heard, growing weaker and further apart.
 The fight was dying out.
 Ethan packed a couple of clips in an ankle pocket.
 He grabbed his Leica, and tucked the gun away in his trousers, behind his
 back.
 He went looking for Nicole; he knew that his real priority would be to
 keep the two of them alive, if it all came down to that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chanting from the church had stopped.
 A few of the sisters were crowded together outside the church doors.
 They stared through the wide open gate at the hazy hillside, as if waiting
 for some sign.
 Some were praying softly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sound of roaring motors had by now become clearly closer.
 Mingled with the sounds of churned dirt and gravel from the rovers' tires,
 it was an uneasy, threatening sound by its own.
 The absence of gunshots meant they were moving up towards the monastery
 again, unhintered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole rushed outside the small hall where the wounded and the sick lay.
 She was wearing a plain work apron, her hair tied in a bun.
 Ethan saw her then and rushed towards her, his camera swinging wildly from
 the strap around his neck.
 She barely seemed to take notice of him; she was staring at the shabby
 road and the approaching rovers with a cold, crisp fixation.
 Anger seethed clearly through her.
 Ethan told her with urgency in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You need to keep calm.
 I think I can handle this.
 Follow my lead when you can, and don't just hand over everything.
 If they sense we're scared shitless, they'll stop at nothing.
 I'll try and sell them a news story, front page on the Times.
 You just stay firm.
 They might want to check up on the infirmary.

Ethan was taken aback.
 It was an unwelcome surprise; he hadn't expected her to be so rigid.
 Feisty was one thing, but not playing ball when guns were involved was
 childish, even stupid and possibly lethal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Listen, the head doctor is already trying to make a run for it in the ravine.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She gave Ethan a cold dismissive look and shook her head slightly, disapprovingl
y.
 Ethan frowned and was about to say something when a rover zipped past the
 gates haphazardly.
 A dozen men armed with AK-47s rode on the back, most of them wearing combat
 fatigues.
 Few piece of clothing matched their size, and most were certainly at least
 a size or two larger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only a couple of them wore shoddy boots; the rest rode barefoot.
 They had grim, lean faces.
 They were mostly skin and bones like on the edge of starvation, but their
 red-shot eyes shone with a cruel, alarming intensity.
 In the back of the faded green and grey rover lay two dead bodies, the
 white of their feet marred by the red of their blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters stood motionless, following the example of the sister superior,
 who was looking at the band of marauding bandits with contempt that bordered
 on hate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another rover passed through the gate.
 It braked badly and skid for a few feet on the courtyard dirt.
 Another ten men, slightly yet markedly better fed, better equipped.
 Some wore sunglasses, some berets and caps.
 Ethan noticed a big brute of a man sitting in the co-driver's seat.
 Once everyone else had jumped off the rover, he stepped out.
 He was wearing spotless combat fatigues as if they had just been pressed.
 He wore the insignia of a Major.
 It was a good thing he didn't seem familiar at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's their leader; if we get to him, the rest will follow,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said to Nicole who was eyeing the bandits with seeping, fervent anger.
 She did not answer; she gave Ethan a sharp accusing look and simply turned
 away.
 The next moment she lost herself inside the impromptu hospital room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan called after her, but she ignored him.
 It was at that point when he attracted the attention of one of the armed
 men, who pointed his rifle at him and shouted something incomprehensible;
 it sounded like Igbo but not a dialect Ethan could understand clearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan put his hands up and grinned like an idiot, trying to look the part
 of a mildly insignificant, completely harmless fool of a journalist.
 The armed bandit was still aiming the rifle at him, shouting incoherently,
 looking back and forth nervously.
 Ethan thought it could be he was asking 'should I shoot him?'; it could
 be he was asking 'can I shoot him?'.
 It would've made little difference had that been the case though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The burly man was overlooking the sisters with one hand cradling a short-barrele
d version of an AK-47; the paratrooper version.
 In his hands, it looked little more than a large handgun.
 He motioned with his free hand and half a dozen men fanned out by two's,
 going inside the rooms and halls on the west side of the monastery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rising heat added to the tension; Ethan was sweating.
 He was hoping Ludwig had gotten everybody out in time; more people would
 mean more problems to solve.
 He was also hoping Nicole wasn't thinking of doing anything stupid.
 Stupid tended to pile on stupid, and that tended to make people end up
 dead or worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was searching for a sight of her, but to no avail; for the first time
 the thought entered his mind that perhaps she was already running away.
 It wouldn't help him much, but it wouldn't make things harder either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's self-appointed guard had stopped shouting; now he was grinning,
 showing a cave of a mouth.
 He was still aiming his gun though, and Ethan thought it was time to make
 his move.
 He shouted, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look, press!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and pointing at his Leica he reached with the other hand at his vest's
 chest pocket, fumbling for the press pass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guard instantly drew back the AKs loading arm carefully, waiting for
 Ethan to make the mistake of flinching.
 For a bunch of ragtag bandits, they exhibited quite the streak of a rather
 unexpected professionalism; stupid nervous people with guns would've shot
 him dead.
 Ethan glanced at the leader who was quietly coming his way, while the rest
 of his men loitered near the sisters pointing guns and casting leery glances.
 That man, Ethan thought, was probably the sole reason why these wretches
 behaved themselves almost like soldiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The leader approached Ethan pacefully, making sure his insignia was prominently
 visible.
 He silently reached at Ethan's vest pocket and pulled out his press pass,
 signed and stamped by the IPA and the UN in one of the British embassy's
 cultural attache's offices.
 The leader took a look at it and read aloud with a thick, grossly cacophonous
 accent:

 with an afterthought, hoping to feed the man's ego.
 Indeed he smiled when he heard the rank, and offered Ethan his press pass
 back.
 He took a quick look around him, the sun glinting off his black raybans.
 Whoever the man was, he was turning in a profit, Ethan thought.
 When he spoke again, he wasn't smiling anymore:

 replied Ethan with a faint smile, his eyes still trying to steal a glimpse
 of Nicole; she must've really gone, he thought to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters were huddled close together, as if waiting for a verdict on
 them.
 The sister superior was eyeing him and the leader of the bandits intensely.
 Maybe she was thinking of doing something stupid herself.
 That would complicate things right when he was trying to achieve a sense
 of rapprochement, if anything like that could be achieved with the likes
 of these people.

 shouted the so-called Major, triumphantly raising both arms in the air.
 He fired off a couple of shots, eliciting a response of wild shots in the
 air from his men who cheered and eyed the sisters with venomous stares.
 They looked barely able to hold themselves; another example in forced disciplin
e.
 He laughed heartily once more, before settling down his gaze towards Ethan
 once more.
 Ethan pitched the idea of the story he had been working on in his mind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think you'd make the perfect story, really.
 I could show the world your living conditions, the way you're defending
 your freedom.
 Add a bit about your backstory, where you came from, what made you quit
 the army.
 It'd be a fantastic piece, a world first,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethan said and aimed the camera at Yuembe.
 He took on a haughty pose like a model, indeed the kind of self-gratifying
 stance photographers tend to think is fit for nobility portraits.
 The camera clicked, and Ethan rolled the film a couple more times, taking
 a few more shots.
 Then Yuembe yanked the camera off its straps suddenly, and Ethan felt his
 plan wasn't working the way it should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'll keep that film.

Ethan nodded, frowning warily.
 He replied carefully:

No problem.
 I can see it could hamper your activities; I can do a text piece only,

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, insisting on trying to stroke the man's ego.
 He knew it wouldn't work when the man took the film out of the camera and
 tucked it inside a pocket.
 He then just threw the camera away, breaking the lens.
 He then asked Ethan, edging his face closer to his the way a boxer might

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said through teeth almost clenched shut.
 Ethan's frown became a deep, long furrow.
 Looking distraught and casting glances around him, he looked completely
 at a loss.
 To complete the show, he said weakly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, of course.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yuembe broke down in laughter and said something in that dialect Ethan couldn't
 quite get.
 All the men laughed along in earnest, pointing at Ethan like a freak exhibit.
 Maybe writing up a story wouldn't hold, but the stupid journalist ploy
 still had something in it, just maybe, Ethan thought to himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the men that had been searching around the monastery called out,
 grabbing Yuembe's attention.
 They had found the caravan's Rovers and supplies.
 Yuembe and his men exchanged a few words from a distance, more like shouts.
 Then he picked a few of them by eyeing them alone, motioned with a hand
 and another half a dozen men left their guns behind.
 Soon they started loading the crates with the red cross first onto their
 own trucks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sister superior was talking with some sisters in a low-keyed voice;
 they seemed somewhat relieved.
 It was beginning to look like the bandits would simply loot what they could

 Organised and disciplined as they seemed to be, they were nothing more

Yuembe then took out a camo pattern handkerchief and wiped the sweat from
 his brow.
 He took off his glasses and wiped the lenses as well; his round black eyes
 were big and calm, the eyelashes almost delicate.
 They belonged to a man who should've become an artist or a doctor, maybe
 even a priest.
 In any case, they didn't look like the kind of eyes that belonged to a
 professional lethal parasite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That grin of his gave him away; Ethan had seen that grin once too many.
 He knew even himself had sported such a grin at times past.
 The thought disturbed him and for a minute he was out of character, looking
 grim and serious all of a sudden.
 Yuembe saw the change on his face; he was instantly intrigued.
 He looked at Ethan from head to toe, scanning him slowly, measuring him.
 He asked him then, hands around his waist, the raybans protruding from
 his chest pocket:

 their rosemaries.
 Some of them praying on their knees, some of them simply staring the men

 turn them away.

 Yuembe said with a devilish grin and then barked an order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another half a dozen men complied and went inside the eastern blocks of
 the monastery.
 Pretty soon, one of them shouted back from the impromptu hospital.
 Another was holding a vest with a red cross painted on it.
 Some groggy voices and malformed protests were put down after a few slaps
 and kicks laid the patients back on their beds for good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yuembe shouted back more orders, looking pissed; veins shot from his temples
 and neck.
 He didn't seem to care about the red cross or the infirmary and the people
 inside.
 That was good; it mean Ludwig and his people were probably safe and not
 a moment too soon.
 Probably Nicole as well.
 He had thought she might help him sound more convincing, but she was still
 nowhere to be seen.
 Maybe she'd proved a problem in any case, Ethan thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thoughts where cut short when he suddenly heard a shout from one of
 Yuembe's men, and then saw bloodied pieces of skull bounce off a door,
 the rest of the bandit's body slumping against it a flick of an eye later,
 when the gunshot was heard.
 A high velocity rifle.
 Though a familiar sound to Ethan, he had been more than just surprised
 to see its effects so vividly at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone froze still; it was the sisters panicked shrieks and loud prayers
 that roused everyone back into a frenzied random activity.
 Ethan hesitated; if someone had stayed behind trying to be a hero, should
 he go all out and take a shot at Yuembe right now? What about the sisters?
 They were completely exposed.
 No, he decided he couldn't risk their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yuembe aimed his AK nervously at Ethan, and shouted at his men infuriated.
 They quickly aimed their guns at windows and doorways, covering the rest;
 a couple of them grabbed the sisters by force one by one, and started to
 tie their hands together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of sisters tried to resist, spitting and kicking their way away.
 Yuembe's men used the AKs shoulderguards like clubs; the nuns suffered.
 A few cracks were heard; bones were brocken.
 The sister superior's proud facade had collapsed; she was now begging the
 men in whatever dialect ran through her tongue, with what few words she
 knew.
 Their captors seemed to enjoy their work, smiling as they heard the wailings
 and sobs of the hapless sisters.
 Yuembe shouted on the top of his lungs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Come out now and I won't hurt the sisters.

.
 His voice became little more than a gurgle as his head exploded violently,
 shrapnel of his skull flying away in all directions.
 His body fell backwards from the overwhelming force of the bullet, the
 AK falling off his limp hand on the ground with a thud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's eyes were scanning for the shooter while his hands instinctively
 went for his gun.
 He was already moving towards the cover of the nearby arches.
 There was no hope in hell that he'd talk the rest of them out of this:
 for one thing, he didn't even speak that damnable dialect, and for another,
 they were already letting off a blind hail of bullets at the mud-and-hay
 brick walls of the monastery, trying for the shooter.
 All they accomplished though was leave behind large pockmarks on the walls,
 splintered doors and spent bullet casings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bandits shouted at each other, confused and dismayed.
 Some looked like they were itching to just shoot the sisters dead.
 One of them cried something like a war shout and let off a single round
 that went through one of the nuns like a hammer through ice.
 The bullet took apart almost her whole left side; blood, bone and guts
 spilled freely through tattered robes.
 She crumbled like a rag doll on the dirt before the church gate, twitches
 and spasms running through her body.
 Her dying throes were little more than a wet cough, deafeningly loud among
 the silence of the sisters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A man with a beret knocked some teeth out of the shooter with his rifle's
 shoulderguard, rendering him unconscious.
 The rest fired off wild shots at windows, more or less blindly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters started to weep.
 The sister superior held her cross in hand, tears running down her cheek;
 still she whispered the dead sister's rites softly in her ear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another gunshot was heard; it missed a bandit on the back of one of the
 Rovers by an inch.
 The ricochet bullet grazed him behind one ear and caused him to fall on
 his back down on the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was now working on instinct and training alone; he would pick his
 targets, going in for the kill.
 He pulled out his gun and rushed towards the rover parked in front of the
 sisters and the church.
 He silently thanked God and his good fortune that Yuembe and his men had
 fallen for the journalist trick, sloppy enough not to bother actually checking
 him for weapons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of Yuembe's men saw him appearing behind one of the arches, pacefully
 coming towards them.
 He pointed with one hand and shouted a warning, instead of shooting.
 Two rounds went through the bandit, and threw him off his feet a couple
 of feet away.
 The shots left his chest in ruins; his lungs and heart a ruptured mess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan switched targets and went for one of the men wearing a beret.
 He let another couple of rounds fly, the Browning nine millimeter pulsating
 in his double-action grip with body-shaking force.
 Years of experience and shooting training brought Ethan's aim lower to
 compensate for the recoil; aim slightly below center of mass, double-tap
 the trigger, swing the body and aim another.
 Repeat.
 It was as easy as riding a bike if one didn't stop to think about the killing
 involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he swung to take down another one, there was a sharp whizzing sound.
 He felt a hot rush of air near the back of his head.
 He turned around to look and saw to his right a man down on the ground,
 trying to grasp his neck with both hands.
 He bleeding profusely, his legs flailing wildly as spurts of blood turned
 into a red fuzzy mist through his fingers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shooter was good; a professional from the likes of it.
 He had probably just saved his life, but there wasn't time for allowing
 the thought to cloud his senses.
 Another bandit appeared from behind a half-wrecked window and let off a
 ripple of bullets from his AK.
 He kept shouting like a crazed madman while shooting, aiming at nowhere
 in particular; the kick of the AK sent the bullets plainly at the old,
 pitted and stained tiled roof, breaking away and chipping whole sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still firing away and before emptying his clip, he was blown back by the
 force of two bullets, one hitting him square in the stomach and another
 in his chest.
 If his heart didn't stop outright, he'd have time enough to meet God when
 his gut wound ate his insides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters were busy untying themselves amidst the confusion.
 They rushed to the inside of the temple, trying to carry their dead sister
 with a modicum of decency.
 They lifted her up, hugging her spilled entrails in their lap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they did so, their former captors and guards let off another hail of
 fire from their AKs trying to take Ethan down; they were controlled, but
 badly aimed bursts.
 Yuembe would have probably made good soldiers out of them if it wasn't
 for their horrid aim and their complete lack of cover discipline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Out in the open with every part of their body exposed and firing from the
 hip, their chances of hitting Ethan laying dirt-low behind a series of
 arches, were slim if not none.
 Their chances became zero when a bullet went through one of them in the
 shoulder; the exit wound was the size of a basketball, turning his spine
 into a shredded ruin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other one of the pair kneeled and raised his rifle to take aim at the
 direction of the shooter.
 Ethan rolled out of cover and popped three shots at him; one caught him
 in the leg, tearing up his calf.
 Another one hit the dirt and the last one went through his armpit and neck,
 cutting an artery open.
 It left him a dying man, unable to even flinch at the scorching sun casting
 its glare at his fading eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan leapt to his feet again and rushed towards the sisters and the church,
 attracting a very unhealthy amount of fire from the west wing of the monastery.
 The bandits that had been on search detail there were now laying down covered,
 taking pot shots whenever they thought it was prudent.
 The shooter had put real fear in their hearts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of those who had left their guns behind to carry sacks and crates
 tried to make a run towards the Rovers for their AKs.
 One of them fell stone dead, leg-first, as if he'd hit his head while running,
 another excellent shot from the unknown shooter.
 His mortal wound was remarkably clean; the bullet had went straight through
 the heart, imploding it and settling down the exit velocity to a lot less
 damaging value.
 The other one just dashed towards a low-walled flower fence and jumped
 over, creeping away back into a semblance of adequate cover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan went past the church's entrance and saw the sisters hugging around
 the body of their dead one.
 He grabbed the sister superior by one arm, while she was clearly paying
 no attention to her surroundings, her face deathly pale, her eyes without
 focus.
 Instinctively she tried to shake him off.
 He caught her stare and tried to convey a sense of calm.
 Panic wouldn't get them anywhere; it could only lead to senseless death.
 He told her then while stray shots seemed to edge dangerously close judging
 by the plaster and chipped wood flying around them:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded then as if magically awaken from a deep slumber.
 He couldn't help noticing her wrinkled, bloodied face looked strangely
 attractive for someone her age and posture.
 Ethan bowed his head to her hand and whispered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

'er grace,'
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and then carried along.
 He stood for a few moments by the temple's door.
 When he heard the distinctive bolt-action gunshot of the mysterious shooter
 he decided to sprint away to a better location; one of the rovers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He placed three shots at the windows up on high on the western edge while
 running.
 He wasn't hoping on actually hitting anything, but he was sure these guys
 would instinctively duck when they heard the shots, sparing him a precious
 couple of seconds to make a more or less safe passage.
 He'd heard the gun go empty; he'd need a chance to reload soon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he reached the Rover, he saw the flash of a scope barely visible near
 the church bell tower.
 He couldn't make out who it was; the sun was still rising directly behind
 him, blinding those who dared to take a shot.
 Clever, natural cover.
 Still, down on the courtyard from near the makeshift hospital, two more
 of the late Major Yuembe's men appeared, firing on full auto towards the
 bell tower as they went.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those on the western dormitories felt like contributing, so they popped
 out of their covers and placed single shots against the bell tower, rather
 blindly.
 The shooter let one shot fly; the cracking echo of the bolt-action came
 right after the thud of the dead body on the ground.
 But no other shots followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan peeked from behind the Rover; the other man was still on the courtyard,
 nervously trying to find cover while surveying the rooftop for the shooter.
 Those on the west side had no clear target, and decided to take their chances
 at Ethan and the Rover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He switched the empty clip with a new full one; if this kept for much time
 longer he'd need to pick one of the AKs lying all around for himself.
 A cacophony of bullets ricocheting off thick metal engulfed him; the Rover's
 thick metal chassis was as good a cover as any.
 It wasn't impervious, but it was good enough for such a tight spot.
 Maybe half a dozen men took shots at him from the western dormitories;
 perhaps more lurked somewhere in the eastern wing.
 Worse still, the unknown shooter had been forced to reposition.
 Less cover for him then for another couple of minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan slithered slowly towards the front of the Rover.
 The engine block would provide better cover.
 As he did so, he kept his gun trained towards the eastern rooms.
 If a head or a gun popped from somewhere out there, he'd simply squeeze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then suddenly saw the one that had come running towards the bell tower
 underneath the first Rover, trying to aim his AK at him while flat on the
 dirt.
 Ethan thought he saw him grinning but he wasn't sure; he simply brought
 his Browning in front of him and fired three shots in rapid succession;
 the man let off his own shot but the sight of Ethan's gun alone opposite
 him was enough to let his aim stray.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, the bulled grazed Ethan slightly over his left shoulder; his third
 shot went wild and punctured a tire.
 The second and first though went through the man's neck and spine.
 He lay there under the Rover, paralyzed and bleeding, choking on his own
 blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A small pin-prick of a flash made Ethan turn around, gun in hand ready to
 shoot.
 As the blinding light turned away from his face for a moment, he saw more
 clearly now the unknown shooter.
 The gun was an M1903 bolt-action, sniper variant with scope.
 And the shooter was, much to Ethan's surprise, noone else but Nicole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't have time to think about that revelation for long; another hail
 of wild gunfire forced her aside, behind a thick wide arch.
 He heard indinstinct shouts in that unknown dialect, and then more gunshots
 were heard.
 None of them landed anywhere near him or Nicole.
 He sacrificed some cover for a better view, quickly scanning for targets.
 He couldn't see any.
 He decided to make a move then.
 He shouted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Nicole! Cover me!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sprang up then and ran without aiming his gun.
 He just run towards the west wing; a single shot was heard.
 One of the bandits wanted to take the opportunity against Ethan, but Nicole's
 aim had proven a lethal discouragement for anyone else as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Ethan reached the low-walled fence, he jumped over it and rolled sideways.
 He scanned aft and fore and saw noone.
 The Rovers were still sitting there, half-loaded with the caravan's supplies.
 Behind him, a flimsy wooden staircase led to the upper floor.
 There were pools of blood dripping down the staircase, and traces of wounded
 bodies being drawn inside rooms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked in Nicole's direction.
 She was giving him a thumbs up.
 He went inside each room methodically, pushing the door open and then peeking
 inside before rushing inside in a crouch.
 He saw bodies of Yuembe's men.
 Most were shot in the back.
 Two of them had shot each other, their bodies laying against opposite walls.
 It seemed to Ethan like the paper-thin veneer of what little comradeship
 and professionalism these bandits seemed to exhibit crumbled when Yuembe's
 head got blown off.
 Their panic and their petty squabbles had undone them completely.
 Some might've fled on foot, but they've left no reason behind to return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search on the upper rooms yielded the bodies of those who had felt lucky
 or proficient enough to take down Ethan or Nicole.
 When he felt it was safe, Ethan shouted from an open wound to Nicole, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 She gave a thumbs up and disappeared back into the infirmary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What a firefight, Ethan thought while overlooking the courtyard from that
 higher vantage point.
 He began counting bodies without even being conscious of it, and then he
 saw one of the bodies was actually moving towards the church, gun in hand.
 His raised his gun to aim clearly and fired away without his usual control;
 the bandit though still had time enough to let off a ripple of fire before
 the bullets struck home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He slumped down on his knees, and fell face down on the dirt, blood oozing
 around him.
 Ethan ran down the staircase shouting at the top of his lungs:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did so, Nicole had already reappeared, this time with a Beretta in
 hand; she moved along hugging the walls with all the care in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan could see the sunlight etching shadows inside the church, but not
 a shadow that moved.
 As he came closer he yelled:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he reached the church door, he saw a the trembling figures of a few of
 the sisters.
 Some of them sat still, frozen in shock.
 Two of them lay down, around a pool of blood.
 One of them was the sister superior; her sisters had closed her eyes, and
 covered her with cloth from the Holy Table.
 The other sister was a young thing, perhaps the younger of them all.
 She was lying in front of the sister, her body mangled horribly; she had
 thrown herself in the way of the bullets but that had not been enough.
 It never really is, Ethan thought almost cynically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole was breathing laboriously when she came next to Ethan.
 He spared a glance at her, but said nothing.
 As her breathing returned to normal, she lowered her Beretta and slumped
 herself against a large wooden chair, drenched in sweat and dirt.
 She had the smell of gunpowder about her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the nuns, still bent over the sister superior's body turned and asked
 Ethan with a croaky voice:

Ethan nodded, made the sign of the cross and walked outside towards the
 Rover.
 The sun was starting to fill most of the courtyard.
 As the adrenaline rush weared off, the smell of blood and gunpowder assaulted
 his nostrils.
 He tried not to inhale too deeply and focused his stare on the church tower,
 ridden with bullet marks.
 He heard something drop behind him; he turned and saw Nicole on her knees,
 heaving her guts.
 He fought the compulsion to do so as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He approached her and helped on her feet.
 She got up and tucked the Beretta in one of her pockets, and walked to
 a water basin on a wall recess near the church.
 Ethan followed close behind her.
 He noticed she had a slightly limp gait; she was hurt.
 He asked her:

Her face softened and the edges of her lips fell flat.

James was overlooking a large map of the area west of the Niger, stretched
 out against a wall of his shadowy office.
 Small pins marked places of interest, unit positions and enemy contacts.
 His hand traced a road to the east, and then he placed another, different
 sort of marker pin there, before smiling thinly to himself.
 He paced around the office with hands behind his back, and stopped for
 a while to take a look outside; he opened the window blinds and gleaming
 white sunlight filled the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was nothing unusual about the small garden plaza: officers were milling
 about, doing mostly nothing of real value, making up plans that rarely
 went ahead or were executed the way they had been conceived.
 James turned and looked at the ceiling fan; it was going at full speed,
 casting shadows that seemed to playfully dance around the room, but it
 did little to make the heat a little more bearable.

James heard a knock on the door.

 Lemons and ice cubes were floating inside.

James took the proferred folders and tossed them on his desk.
 He sat down as well, the Captain fidgeting on the chair, trying to feel
 the waft of the ceiling fan; the intolerable heat had sweat piling up on
 his brow.
 James put on a pair of glasses and opened the first folder.
 He started browsing the folder, sipping on some ice cold tea along the
 way.
 In a couple of minutes, he'd skimmed through most of the folder, and he
 had picked up the second one.

The Captain realised that and was awaken from his heat-induced stupor to

Heed no prayer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig was sweating profoundly, slowly packing small boxes of essential
 medicine onto one of the Rovers.
 The sun had begun its descent beyond the surrounding hills, but the heat
 and moisture was intolerably unabated.
 Ethan was helping Nicole load the wounded Red Cross people in two of the
 Rovers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The patients from the infirmary would ride in the open-top Rovers the bandits
 had left behind.
 Two of them needed a stretcher, bad cases of malaria.
 The rest were mostly kids, left to fend on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though bullet-ridden and shoddy-looking the Rovers worked fine; they would
 have to do.
 Ethan needed to keep just one of the Red Cross Rovers.
 Ludwig had indulged him without pausing to think about it; for all it mattered,
 he had saved their lives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sisters, fourteen souls left in all, would ride along with the caravan
 carrying their meagre belongings.
 They were leaving little of real value behind them.
 As they climbed inside the back of the Rovers, Ethan took a moment to watch
 them intently.
 Nicole had just stopped for a smoke.
 He turned and told her then with a flat, calculating expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Look at them.
 Three of them dead.
 Vacant stares, hollow gazes.
 Still, they keep their rosemaries in hand, muttering prayers.
 Will that make them feel better about it?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let a small cloud of smoke hazily drift away from her as she sat with
 her back against the Rover's door, legs crossed at her ankles, one hand
 in her apron's pocket.
 She smiled thinly before she replied:

\begin_layout Standard
He crossed his arms in front of his chest and cast a thoughtful gaze towards
 the small graveyard where only a couple of hours ago they had buried the
 three sisters, alongside the bandits.
 The surviving nuns had insisted on it.
 He shook his head absent-mindedly then and said:

It never really does.
 I'm only saying, how can they go on after what's happened?

It's people just like them that do go on.
 Faith, remember? I've talked to their new superior.
 She's decided to dissolve the order.

 Each will have to go her own way.
 She probably thinks it'll help them heal over time.

He let his voice trail off, shaking his head in disbelief.
 Nicole was about to say something when they both saw Ludwig approaching
 them, wiping his forehead and arms from the sweat in vain; in a minute
 he'd be sweating once more.
 He nodded to Nicole and smiled, but turned to talk to Ethan, slightly out
 of breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're ready.
 We should be at Lagos by morning.

The wounded are stable.
 Everyone's shaken, closed to themselves mostly.

 said the doctor and shrugged somehow apologetically.
 Ethan simply nodded.
 The doctor continued:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't thank you enough for what you've done really.
 We could actually hear the gunfight, but we kept running, just like you
 said.
 The sisters said you had some help.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at Nicole sideways then but he was smiling gently, his eyes gleaming
 softly.
 Nicole shuffled as if feeling uncomfortable and said to the doctor without
 looking back:

Not that much there, really.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan placed a kind hand on the doctor's shoulder but before he could speak,
 Ludwig let out a snort of a laugh and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I get it Ethan.
 When we get back, I'll need to file a report; an enquiry will ensue.
 Perhaps I'll be charged.
 Then I expect there'll be some uproar from the embassies, the press.
 People will hear about this, certainly.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's gaze for a moment turned sour while Nicole shot a worried glance
 at Ludwig but he went on, this time with a somber look on his face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know what you're thinking.
 The minefield, the bandits.
 The sisters getting killed.
 People's memories do become jarred from experiences like these.
 Frankly, some genuinely don't recall there even was a journalist along.
 And the sisters, well..
 Poor souls have a lot on their minds now.
 Not to mention there's a war going on.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded, grinning shamelessly.
 Though the cloak and dagger routine had largely lost its meaning now that
 the caravan was turning back, the doctor had turned out to be a welcome
 though strange and unlikely ally.
 He extended a hand, which the doctor promptly gripped.
 Ethan then said:
\end_layout

I take it you'll cover for me,

Nicole nodded half-heartedly, while the doctor replied:

The way things turned out I should be thanking you, Ethan.
 I'm convinced that without you, we'd be dead or maybe worse.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor shook Ethan's hand and looked him in the eye with a sobering,
 stone-hard gaze.
 The lifeless mangled bodies of the three dead nuns came unbidden to his
 mind then and he was unable to meet Ludwig's stare.
 He nodded limply and the doctor caught him by the arm, telling him reassuringly
:

Ethan hesitated; he felt unable to find the right words.
 Nicole jumped in, a dull expression on her face, her voice a gritty affair:

You feel sorry for them?

 she said with a vicious stare that marred her features.

Ethan blinked furiously while Ludwig simply stood there.
 They felt something they had said had ticked off Nicole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Listen, Nicole, I understand you -
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he managed to blurt before she cut him mid-sentence and said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't need your understanding!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before leaving them flabbergasted to watch her briskly pace towards her
 guestroom.
 Ethan made a motion to follow her but Ludwig reached an arm and blocked
 his path:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It won't help.
 She's grieving.
 Try not to make it harder,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ludwig, rearranging his glasses slowly.
 Ethan turned to say something as if in protest, but he simply stood there,
 facing her way.
 He said to the doctor then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not at all like her.
 I mean, I barely know her, but I wouldn't think she'd take all this that
 hard.

Ludwig shook his head and looked Ethan straight in the eye; despite their
 height difference he managed to sound like a teacher scolding a schoolboy:

The doctor was almost glaring at Ethan, who cooly replied in a low, calm
 voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is a war going on.
 I wouldn't exepct that from everyone, but she's seen war.
 She knows what it's like and I believe that.
 It's just..
 odd.
 I mean, she's acting odd.
 She killed maybe half or more of the bandits.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig frowned and his forehead wrinkled, beads of sweat trailing his temples.
 He opened his mouth to speak, and almost stuttered the words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She killed?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan simply nodded and fixed his gaze at Nicole's guestroom, his face a
 pensive, blank wall.
 The doctor spoke again:

How?

 Ludwig asked with some reluctance:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Then you two are..
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, letting his voice trail rather uncomfortably.
 Ethan blinked and smiled somewhat lamely with a frown upon his face before
 shaking his head furiously.
 He told the doctor then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Good God, no.
 That kind of woman would be the death of me.

 Absurd!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig shook his head with no hint of good humor other than a slight curl
 of his lip.
 He then wiped the sweat on his forehead with one sleeve, while he said
 to Ethan rather flatly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How can you joke about anything after all this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan thought about it for a moment and then said rather mirthlessly:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ludwig looked at him with a pondering expression.
 Before he could reply, one of his staff shouted out for his attention.
 He gave a thumbs up; the engines of the Rovers roared into life one after
 the other.
 They were heading back.
 He then simply said to Ethan with a shrug:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Well, thanks again.

 The doctor shook his head, backtracked a few steps and then started jogging
 towards the open door of a waiting Rover.
 When he climbed aboard, he had one last glimpse of Ethan lighting a cigarette,
 and waving them goodbye.

The moon was waxing low on the night sky.
 Its white sheen sometimes came through muddied through the wispy clouds
 that toiled lazily past it.
 And when the cool wind blew the murky clouds away, the shapeless shadows
 that covered everything below vanished within a swath of summer moonlight
 that could easily lure a man into thinking all was well in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such trappings of the mind were not new to Ethan; he'd seen first hand what
 such a serene, beguiling night could do to a man.
 Guards stabbed from behind inside their trenches, patrolmen lying dead
 on the ground, their throats slit open - their still warm blood misting
 in the chilly night air.
 The sudden feeling of a hand on his shoulder electrified him at first,
 and then sent a numbing sensation that grew all along his right side down
 to his hip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked around as if in a dream, half-waiting for the thrust of a bayonet
 through his jugular.
 It was Nicole; the thought of how the hell she'd slipped behind him unnoticed
 sprang inside his mind.
 It was unnerving, more so for a soldier and doubly so for a Scout of the
 Royal Marines.
 `Damn her!', he thought while he saw her grinning as if she'd had intended
 to catch him off-guard.
 Her voice sounded rather casual, but there was the barest glint of mischievous
 success about it:

She looked at him with a frown.
 The light of the oil lamp inside the room flickered around her face as
 if it danced to a rhythm of its own.
 She replied with a hurt tone, as if taken aback:

 He crossed his arms as if feeling threatened and said flatly:

Her face became contorted and it looked as if she was about to break down
 into sobs and cries for barely a moment.
 But she held on and said sharply:

I risked my life back there.

Now that's what's bugging me,

 He went on with an even, accusing tone of voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're not just good with a rifle: you're an excellent shot.
 You didn't hesitate, you actually went inside and picked up that M1903.
 And by the way, that's not exactly a Derringer.
 Neither is that Beretta.
 I mean, I'm not ungrateful or anything, but just how the fuck did you get
 hold of those? And since when does one become such a pro with a couple
 of weeks of fighting? Who the hell are you, really now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole looked at him sternly at first for an itchy moment that faintly smelled
 of danger, but then her face dissolved in a small, tight smile abruptly.
 As if she could relax now, she sat down on the cot across the small table
 and the oil lamp and said to Ethan with a weird, all too american accent:
\end_layout

Ethan eyes fluttered violently of their own volition.
 His hand went instinctively to the Browning laying reassuringly behind
 his back, but Nicole urged him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 I mean I'm CIA.
 Please, that's not necessary.
 Really, we're in this together.
 I really am Andy's wife.

 He doesn't really know who I work for.
 Never did.
 In a way, I am to blame for what's happened to him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She looked downcast, glancing at Andy, waiting for some kind of explosion
 on his side, some kind of reproach or exclamation that never came.
 Instead, he sat back down on the chair and looked at Nicole as if she was
 barely there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

CIA?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

She nodded slowly.
 Ethan took a small liquor bottle out of a chest pocket, opened it and had
 a swig.
 He barely grimaced while the Littlemill ran down his throat, and asked
 tersely:
\end_layout

Some kind of mission, then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded with some reluctance this time.
 Her face was withdrawn, almost expressionless but for the small, wordless
 movements of her mouth.
 Ethan gulped down a mouthful of Littlemill and almost yelled incredulously:

He's going to ask for a divorce when he finds out, you know.
 I'm not one for breaking up a marriage, but when I do tell him - and I

She raised an eyebrow at that and said nothing.
 Instead, she got up from the cot and said to Ethan, her hands in her pockets:

Ethan let out a long breath, and stared at Nicole for an uncomfortable,
 long moment.
 She didn't seem eager to challenge his mood.
 At length, he asked her:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's eyes trailed Nicole's face.
 There was a strange glitter about them, an icy glow that rendered his gaze
 keen like a knife.
 He seemed to scrutinise her features one by one, when he finally said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You were their handler.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She stared blankly at the wall for a moment before bowing her head and sighing.
 She clasped her hands together and said softly, almost indelibly:

Yes.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
She nodded with closed eyes.
 Ethan went for his pack of cigarettes, shaking his head furtively.
 She then cleared her throat and added very business-like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's more to it.
 The guns.

She nodded shallowly.
 Her face suddenly grew darker than the ill lamplight could account for:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's eyes became narrow at first.
 When the fear of realisation began to hit home, his eyes bulged even as
 he lit his cigarette.
 The tip of the cigarette grew glowing red-hot and he asked through a small
 fog of smoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ethan's face became flush suddenly, barely contained anger in his voice
 with just the slightest hint of worry:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're still here then? The guns are still here.
 Fuckall!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a rather glum attempt at sounding sheepish, Nicole added flatly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We should get going.
 There might be more groups interested in the cace.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ethan grabbed his knapsack and cocked his Browning, before darting outside
 the door towards the Rover and saying rather furiously mostly to himself:

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan had driven for the better part of the night mostly in silence.
 What little words they had exchanged were about directions, miles, maps
 and compasses.
 He had tried to make their journey shorter, sometimes picking a dirt road
 or trail, and some times ploughing through the savannah head on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They'd seen pin-pricks of light in the distance blinking on and off in their
 path; the creatures of the night cleared a path in their wake.
 It was mostly hyenas they saw, as well as owls.
 Each time the hyenas saw the Rover's headlights they paused in the feast
 of the carcass and gazed with eyes like gems; then they carried on, the
 instinct of fear quite outdone by hunger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan thought that had it been any other time their improvised journey through
 the plains and the hills of Nigeria might've been quite fascinating; a
 proper night safari, a peek at the pure, wild Africa, untouched by man.
 But that was just a passing idea; so much had happened in so little time,
 that Ethan found it at times difficult to focus on simply driving, his
 mind racing in all sorts of different directions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At some point he had felt the need to sleep but carried on for an hour or
 so as if his life dependent on it.
 Nicole had kept silent all along.
 She sometimes dozed off even as the Rover rocked and rumbled over crests
 and gutters, hilly sides and gravel trails.
 She didn't seem to share the same fatigue as Ethan, who kept straightening
 himself up, breathing sharply in an effort to stay awake no matter what.
 At length, while on a small dirt road beset with tall savvanah grass, she
 asked him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let me drive.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan rolled his eyes before settling them on her face while his mouth widened
 slowly into a grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think not,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, and yawned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You'll fall asleep on the wheel if you go on like this.
 You need to get some rest,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, looking worried.
 Ethan glanced at her sideways and kept driving, seemingly about to pass
 out in any moment.
 He shook his head drowsily without replying.
 Nicole insisted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look, if you won't let me drive at least pull over and get some sleep.
 For God's sake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan drew a deep breath and shook himself trying to stay alert.
 He told her then without taking his eyes off the road, his voice shallow,
 almost resigned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fine.
 Remember, check your compass and clock; stick to the zig-zag on the map
 and we should be fine.
 Give me one hour, then wake me up.
 Understood?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole's eyes rolled ever so slightly; that had sounded like an order.
 She replied with a raised eyebrow with evident irritation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I understand you don't trust me yet, and that's clearly wrong because we're
 doing this together whether you planned it, like it or not.
 It's about Andy, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan braked gently then and brought the rover to a stop.
 He closed his eyes and sat with fists clenched on the wheel, breathing
 shallowly.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I remember,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and went on looking at Nicole through bloodshot eyes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just don't bloody fuck this up.
 We need to reach the outskirts of Onitsha very much alive and completely
 unseen if at all possible.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look, I'm not a hapless bitch you can just work around, alright? Jesus,
 you think you're so hot stuff don't you? Please shut up, and sleep,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said loudly but without screeching or yelling.
 Her somewhat pale face was flush with a red tint of anger, locks of her
 hair stuck on her temples.
 Ethan strangely thought about how menacingly beautiful she looked then.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He smiled thinly, nodded to himself and got out of the Rover as sharp as
 he could, straining himself to get to the co-driver's seat as fast as possible.
 When they crossed each other in front of the Rover, they exchanged a strange
 look, and almost halted their stride for the barest second.
 A few moments later, Nicole was behind the wheel while Ethan lay in the
 seat next to her, arms crossed and legs drawn together, snoring like a
 hog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They'd been carving a criss-cross path towards Onitsha, the gateway to the
 Biafran territory east of the Niger.
 The small city had been swapping hands for the past few months between
 the federal government and the Biafrans.
 For the past couple of months, it lay in government hands, considered marginall
y safer.
 Still, the frontline was in an almost constant flux; units from both sides
 would occasionally try and force their passage over the Niger.
 It would come as no big surprise to Ethan if they suddenly encountered
 Biafran patrols instead of government troops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the hours went by, the savvannah gave way to the lush riverside, full
 of mangroves and thick, green bush.
 The last of the starry sky shone its deep blue light.
 For a moment, it felt as if the rover was wading through a dreamscape,
 the primal Africa of the spirit fathers and the blessed mother Earth.
 The illusion quickly melted away as the primrose red dawn cowardly crept
 over the horizon.
 Ethan sat upright startled, his arms still tightly hugging his chest.
 He glanced around sharply and asked Nicole:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What time is it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
She glanced at her wristwatch without taking her hands off the wheel and
 told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's almost six in the morning.
 We should be there in about an hour.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said slighty miffed and took another look around him.
 He closed his eyes for a moment and looked at her viciously:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're on the road.
 I told you, to stay off the road.
 What if-
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What if we're on the road? Wouldn't it look even more strange if someone

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

She stared blankly at the road and replied calmly with a vehement gaze:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Like Andy's brother.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan let out a laugh of surprise despite himself.
 He was at a loss for words for a few moments, and Nicole went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe you're too scared.
 You'd be an idiot if you weren't, but at this rate..
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Nicole shook her head and scoffed.
 She said with a flat, nearly emotionless voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan did not answer.
 He was simply staring at her intently, as if searching for something on
 her face.
 She took notice and asked him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan rested his head on his hand and let out a sigh.
 He shrugged and told her:

 asked the young lieutenant at the checkpoint.
 He was squinting under the bright morning sun, a pair of sunglasses tucked
 away neatly in his shirt pocket.
 Ethan replied nonchalantly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's a newspaper.
 Press?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, and showed off a battered, smudged, laminated press pass with
 his photo on it.
 The young lieutenant stared back for barely a moment before nodding to
 Nicole.
 He asked them:

Red Cross nurse? All alone out here?

 Ms.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethan said and looked at her with a thin smile.
 She barely glanced back at the lieutenant with an uncertain smile, pretending
 to feel awkward.
 He shook his head and without a word, waved at the guard to raise a shoddy,
 rust-ridden metal bar.
 Ethan gave a mock salute and thanked him, while Nicole started the engine
 and drove off slowly towards the bridge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a few yards Ethan looked back through the mirror, and saw the lieutenant
 still shaking his head; he noticed a smile and then a few laughs from the
 guards.
 He was joking; that was good.
 That meant they thought they were probably crazy; which wasn't that far
 off from reality.
 Nicole asked him then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're lax.
 It's like they think it's just another job.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan laid back in his seat and lit a smoke.
 He told her then as they crossed the bridge, the rover bucking slightly
 at each segment, his head lolling freely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Well, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She spared a frowned a look lazily before replying and shifting gear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I like to think it's a lot more.
 I'm a bit surprised you seem so..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 She paused mid-sentence, her mouth half-open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the Rover reached the other side, a guard motioned them to stop.
 A soldier sitting inside a small shack that offered some relatively comfortable
 shadow was noting down their plates, cross-checking it against some sort
 of list.
 Nicole found the word she'd been searching for and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He smiled thinly and tapped away the ash from his cigarette over the open
 window.
 He shook his head and said with half a smile:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She smiled wearily and once the guard waved them on their way, she sped
 towards the center of the city through the main road.
 They both peered through open windows at the strange mix of people, land
 and buildings that seemed so impossibly jarring to the eye.
 Red brick walls looked inherently unable to hold even the smallest tin
 roof, while the people around them went about their morning business dressed
 in all sorts of colours from the drab gray shirt to the colourful rainbow
 woolen tunics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goats were being herded in pairs by the equivalent of a milkman, and quite
 a small crowd of mostly women and children seemed to be waiting in line
 expectantly.
 Small groups of soldiers seemed to be dispersed along the road, idly but
 warily overlooking the passers-by.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were driving alongside the river, the east bank on their left.
 Little by little the rural outskirts gave way to more and more concrete,
 more and more colour.
 The town seemed relatively intact from the fighting, but the unmistakable
 signs were there: bullet-ridden blue and red walls, makeshift barricades
 and gun posts mingled with food stalls and workshops.
 The people seemed to take things in their stride.
 Whatever else, they still lived there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They drove past the harbor and the piers where the military presence was
 more than evident: stores of supplies seemed to be piling up, while barges
 slowly waded through the Niger, loaded to the brim.
 Nearby, fishermen were preparing their nets as they did every day.
 Nicole broke the silence first:

Ethan snorted almost derisively, and with his gaze fixed on the golden reflectio

 She retorted:

She braked abruptly and pulled over in front of a small three-storey building

A man that appeared to be the hotel manager stepped through the doorway,
 dressed in a white linen shirt, smart black trousers and matching shoes,
 around his forties, tall, thin, almost gaunt.
 He smiled rather widely, a few nickel-cases showing.
 He bowed slightly before adding:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

No, thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Nicole, and Ethan shook his head.
 He told him then:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
The manager was already shuffling through the guestbook when he asked somewhat
 confused:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You mean a double?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole sniggered behind Ethan, while he spoke slowly and surely, as if to
 a child, stressing each word:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Two separate rooms with a single bed.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The manager looked apprehensively at both of them for a moment, and then
 smiled assuredly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Certainly, sir, madam.
 Cash up front, please.
 Hotel policy.
 Five hundred,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, nodding to both of them.
 Ethan raised a brow but nevertheless pulled five hundred's bills and paid.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you.
 We're happy to have you staying.
 Please, follow me,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the manager said and led them to the first floor, to their rooms.
 Each one a miniscule affair with a water basin and remarkably a proper
 bed.
 There was a common toilet at the end of the hallway.
 The manager then said with almost unbridled pride:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are separate facilities for the ladies!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethan said smiling ironically while Nicole seemed to ignore him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The manager looked at them both once more fleetingly, opened his mouth to
 ask something but thought better of it and said nothing.
 He then straightened himself and said in business-like tones:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you very much,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ethan said, while Nicole stared outside the hallway window onto the street
 below.
 The manager bowed again before adding:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ring the bell if you need me.

\begin_layout Standard
He woke up with a mild headache.
 There was still light pouring in from the small window.
 He felt his body ache from all the exertion the night before.
 He checked his wristwatch; it was almost four in the afternoon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He vaguely remembered seeing a strange dream.
 The one thing he was certain about was that the dream hadn't been a nightmare.
 Curiously enough he remembered it had something to do with James.
 He itched in various places; he scratched reflexively and noticed the bites:
 mosquitoes.
 He washed his face and scrubbed some of the muck and dirt away, feeling
 a bit freshened and somewhat cleaner.
 He put on his clothes and tied his shoes with the usual haste of a professional
 soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He picked up his key and his camera along with the press card, and closed
 the door behind him.
 He went over to Nicole's room and knocked, but she didn't reply.
 He knocked again but didn't shout; she might be still sleeping he thought,
 and went down the stairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hotel manager was serving coffee to some clients that looked quite foreign,
 blond-haired and red-faced.
 Evidently he was the sole proprietor, manager, and waiter.
 Probably noone else worked here anymore.
 He had simply, like others in the city, decided to stay, despite the war.
 Curiously enough, there was still money to be made even at a time and place
 such as this one.
 The manager took notice of him and waved from the table he was serving.
 He told him with a smile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Letter for you Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded and smiled thinly, thinking it strange Nicole had already left
 without waking him up.
 He noticed the foreigners, a man and a woman, looked at him vaguely but
 quickly resumed sipping their coffee silently.
 The hotel manager went behind his flimsy-looking counter and unlocking
 a small cabinet, gave Ethan a small envelope.
 Ethan was about to ask for an opener, when the manager promptly offered
 a simple kitchen knife which did the job just as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a small note inside the envelope; Nicole had to get in touch with
 a certain valuable contact of hers.
 She had written down a list of people and places where he should start
 asking questions.
 He immediately felt shut out, as if running errands on her behalf.
 Maybe it was less time consuming that way, or maybe she had other, work-related
 priorities.
 The Agency.
 What kind of operation where the Yanks really running down here? He had
 little idea about how these things worked.
 He decided he'd ask her some real hard questions about all this business
 when they met later that night at a shady place called 'Queen Madimba'.
 Until then, he had to make a call.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there some place I can make a call in private?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The manager rolled his eyes for a moment, then said with slight apprehension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For you, it is probably possible.
 You'd need to get over to Victoria Square, talk to whoever's in charge
 there.
 All landlines go through the military, you see.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded and smiled, before adding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would know my way around.
 Is there a map I could use? I wouldn't want to end up in a minefield or
 something now, would I?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and smiled, while the manager found the joke lacking and simply
 gave Ethan a shoddy, trodden piece of paper that was a rough drawing of
 the relative locations of the hotel, the river, the city center and the
 harbor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Victoria Square is in the city center.
 Ask around if you need anything else.
 And I would like that back when you're done,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the hotel manager before adding:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I lost my wife to a mine, only last year.
 It is no laughing matter.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Certainly.
 I was just..
 Right, thank you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethan said and walked out onto the street, which was mostly empty.
 Apart from the heat and the nearly debilitating moisture in the air, there
 was little to do other than peddle foodstuffs and alcohol to passing troops
 and patrols, either on or off duty.
 Kids would invariably pop in and out of sight, some playing catch or football,
 others trying to sell something they'd fished in the river.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The town seemed subdued; poor, but still living.
 Hurt, but not destroyed.
 His walk took him through a few streets he could barely recognise.
 Some of those were in his list, others were in fact nothing more than alleys
 or dirt paths.
 He decided to grab a bite at a stall selling fried fish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While he ate, he noticed the peculiar silence.
 This was a city at war, in the front lines, but nothing other than the
 presence of the military reminded him of that.
 There was no shelling, no gunfire, no sound of engines revving up and armor
 clamoring by.
 A city under siege, without walls or trenches, nothing but the river as
 a moat.
 It seemed like nothing would ever force the people to abandon it, except
 perhaps the river drying up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt full after the first fish and drank a couple mouthfuls of beer.
 It felt like home for the barest moment: lukewarm and tasteless, just like
 the water in this town.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then made his way straight to Victoria square where he could see a lot
 more soldiers, jeeps and trucks.
 It looked like every other building around the square had been taken over
 as barracks, storage or command center.
 The congregation of so many soldiers in one place looked like a staging
 area.
 Perhaps some kind of operation was about to begin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he approached a small tent near a guardpost, a soldier shouted at him
 something in Yoruba, without bothering to aim his rifle at him.
 Ethan held both hands high, one of them holding the press pass.
 The soldier squinted at it, and called one of his superiors, a sergeant
 by the looks of his stripes.
 The sergeant looked at Ethan with puzzled disbelief:

The sergeant said something to the soldier and they broke down in laughter.
 Despite the complete lack of courtesy, the sergeant pointed at the small
 tent and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Try the Captain,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and resumed what must have been a keen joke between himself and the guard
 on duty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan approached the tent were a rather small man with the insignia of a
 Captain was studying maps and a few sheets of reports, sitting down in
 a fold-up garden chair.
 On the small table, his service revolver lay in pieces, ready to be cleaned.
 Ethan cleared his throat and announced himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Captain? Richard Owls, London Times.
 I'm sorry to bother you, but I do need to phone my office.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Captain looked up from his work briefly and barely registering Richard
 he pointed to a hand-crank magnetic phone.
 He told him then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The captain smiled broadly, and Ethan replied with a nod.
 He asked for the operator and after giving the number, there was a small
 pause, and then some more silence before the silky voice of a woman came
 on the phone:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There were a few moments of silence and then some hiss and the sound of
 lines mingling and connecting.
 Finally, after almost half a minute Ian could be heard on the other side:

The old man drained the last of the beer off the keg, and brought the bottle
 to Ethan's small table.
 There was some beer foam right at the mouth of the bottle, which the old
 man blew away with a whizzy puff, before settling it down on the table.
 He then looked at Ethan with wide, almost hazy, glassy eyes and said:

 He drank another gulp of beer and asked the old man, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 trying to sound non-chalant, unconvincingly enough.

 leathery faces worn through a life-time of being used to hardships of all
 kinds.

Ethan couldn't manage a reply.
 Taken by surprise by their straightforward manner, he barely managed a

 The one who hadn't even spoken a word said then, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 smiled, shrugged and sipped his beer.
 The owner was sitting behind his counter, and tapping his hand with each
 word he said to Ethan,

Ethan took the hint, nodded almost reverentially, drank another gulp of

 As he stepped outside the door, he began to realise there was a lot more

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the leads proved to be dead ends as well; they all talked about
 a red cross caravan, and they had all heard about the attack.
 But nothing solid, nothing first hand.
 Those few shady people that made a living trading all sorts of information
 had either been laying too low to be found or had simply refused to deal;
 one of them had just left saying the whole thing was too hot.
 In any case, all the useful info about Andy boiled down to that he was
 indeed missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soldiers on jeeps and foot patrols made their presence felt around the town
 while Ethan moved about; they asked him for his papers on more than one
 occasion.
 They had lists with names and photos, actively looking for people that
 the Nigerian government had one way or the other decided had been acting
 against their best interest: Soldiers of fortune, spies, people who made
 it their business to know all kinds of dangerous, possibly profitable things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An English journalist casually roaming about Onitsha and asking people questions
 then could be all three things if his name or photo was on that list.
 It was a crude thing to do, using soldiers for field intelligence work,
 but then again he himself was running on pure luck and whatever ropes James
 was pulling.
 His cover was extremely thin, but he had no other option; it was only a
 matter of time before someone would notice he was nowhere to be found,
 and still he had nothing solid on Andy.
 At least, he thought to himself, they hadn't found a body yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evening breeze brought the smell of river life to Ethan as he walked
 past a checkpoint under an old, anglican church.
 He stood there for a moment or so with real, keen interest as its small
 congregation poured outside, shuffling their feet with purpose: it would
 be curfew time soon.
 True enough, the chruch bell started to ring, forcing Ethan to look at
 his watch: half past seven.
 He would run a bit late for his meeting with Nicole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded with an uncertain smile at the soldiers motioning him to get off
 the street and hastily took off towards the river bank, quickly disappearing
 in the flimsy shade of a small shop alley.
 He could hear movement and shouts behind him; the military police was hurrying
 people out of the streets and into their houses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of the alley he ventured a quick look behind him.
 Nothing.
 As he crossed an empty street, he noticed it was the same in every direction
 he gazed at: The natural denizens of city streets, dogs and cats alike,
 could barely be seen hiding away under alcoves, small balconies and porches.
 Pigeons and swallows were trudging along stained rooftops lazily, and even
 rats seemed attuned to the curfew, fleeing purposefully back into their
 shadowy nests wherever there were people left to harrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he noticed more movement near the river bank, jeeps and trucks moving
 along the length, while all the while tugboats putted away upstream.
 With a fleeting look he noticed a patrol coming his way.
 Across the street, he finally saw a sign that read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Madimba
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 He crossed the empty road with a casual walking pace, and pushed the door
 open.
 A flight of steps lead downward into a dimly lit cellar, hushed conversations
 and the faint but unmistakable sound of brass; jazz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He closed the door behind him and carefully tread down the narrow steps.
 He then looked around, taking in the whole setting of the underground bar.
 It was elegantly decorated but crudely furnished; crammed but somehow everyone
 seemed comfortably seated.
 The smell of sweat and smoke weighed heavy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a small wonder that a place like that could be found hidden away
 amidst the forefront of a war, but there was an explanation for that as
 well; it was packed with foreigners.
 Europeans from the look and sound of them, almost down to the last one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then saw Nicole silently waving him over to a table near one corner of
 the establishment; a tall, lank black man was sitting beside her.
 After wading through tightly packed tables and customers, he pulled up
 the single empty chair and sat, addressing Nicole:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who is this?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This is Adu, Adu Nebdele.
 He's going to help us get to Owerri.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

First of all, I don't like the fact we didn't talk this over first.
 Why Owerri?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu then spoke out of turn, just when Nicole was about to talk and bluntly
 said with a cultivated accent:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think your brother's dead.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who is this again?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan without even turning to acknowledge the man's existence.
 Nicole replied with a calming voice, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've known this man far longer than you, Ethan.
 You can trust him, he's been more than useful in the past.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan shook his head and sagged back on his chair.
 He flicked his gaze between Nicole and Adu, and said with a sickly grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can I now? What makes him such an expert on dead people?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole's face flashed red with slow-boiled anger and her piercing eyes met
 Ethan's with a decisive clash.
 Neither of them seemed willing to look away.
 Adu then drew himself closer to Ethan and said in a low-keyed voice, trying
 to sound condescending:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a brother-in-law, works in the morgue.
 There's been lot of work lately.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan spared a vehement look in Adu's direction that only seemed to stick
 for a moment or two.
 He then lowered his gaze and said after sighing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need a drink.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu nodded and asked him casually:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scotch?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought there was a war going on,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ethan, a mocking expression on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not if you're a white Englishman with pounds to spare.
 Anything particular?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Adu to which Ethan answered along with a wave of his hand, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't go that far.
 Anything other than rye would be good.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu smiled thinly, nodded and got up.
 As he slowly made his way through the crowded tables towards the bar at
 the other end, Ethan told Nicole with ire in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't appreciate this.
 Who the hell is that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He's an associate.
 A valuable associate.
 Has been for the past three years.
 If you can't trust him, you can't trust me, and that would be a damn shame
 because I want us to find Andy.
 Alive.
 Maybe you're having second thoughts about this,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Nicole, nursing a barely touched glass of wine.
 Ethan almost erupted into a drowned out shout:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now hold on a minute! The last thing I need right now is some sort of lecture
 from the wife and all sorts of Agency bullshit!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole's face had a serious, business-like look when she said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Adu is a very well connected man.
 He keeps an uneasy balance between the two sides.
 I've been going in and out thanks to him ever since I've been operating
 here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Which brings us to the question, what exactly are you working on here? And
 why did you drag Andy into this mess?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Listen, I really wish I hadn't but that was his choice.
 It really was.
 I thought it would be relatively safe.
 That was my mistake.
 Now, about the job..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She let her voice trail off while the jazz filled the next few silent moments.
 Ethan shook his head and said through a tight, forced smile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bloody right.
 A mistake.
 But not the last one.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their gazes remained locked like lovers in a quarrel; neither one seemed
 willing to let go, as if in a staring contest.
 Instead of passion though, there was breweing anger.
 When Adu returned with Ethan's drink though, they looked away as if somehow
 slightly embarassed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thanks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan with barely audible mutter, while Nicole silently sipped at
 her own glass of wine.
 Adu then told Ethan matter-of-factly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can imagine you might be upset about this, but it's good, solid information.
 Caucasian, English passport.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll wait and see with my own two eyes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethan replied and then said to Nicole accusingly, striking his finger at
 the table, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I've been running in circles all day, and you simply ask your man and it's
 a done deal? Andy's dead?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The jazz song playing in the background reached a crescento, sax and trumpets
 blaring with a virtuoso's tenacity, easily drowning out the mingled, hushed
 voices all around the 'Madimba'.
 Nicole looked at Ethan with watery eyes and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Andy's not dead.
 I believe he is not dead.
 But we have to know, don't we? To keep looking, we have to know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan drank a mouthful of the scotch.
 It made him flinch, his face sour.
 He nodded and said flatly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

True enough.
 Besides, Owerri was down the road anyway.
 When do we leave?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole shrugged and said, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We can't leave tonight, not with the curfew in place.
 Tomorrow at dawn, at the earliest.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So what does that mean, we're stuck here for the night as well?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan indignantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu's mouth widened into a knowing smile, showing an impressively bright
 set of teeth before he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a small room with a cot on the top floor were you can spend the
 night.
 A guesthouse, if you like.
 Besides, the curfew isn't all that it's cracked up to be if you're white
 and willing to spend money.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

We could just bribe the MPs then? That simple?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If you find anyone sober.
 Things have been quiet for too long around here.
 They feel settled, at ease.
 There's no fighting right now.
 Regrouping, they call it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But still..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Everyone needs to unwind.
 War is a tiresome affair, no? I'd thought you would know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan laughed despite himself and downed the rest of his scotch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is this why this place is full of foreigners? Noone really bothers with
 the curfew? Because the scotch it serves is barely three years old.
 All it's good for is a pissing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu nodded with a thin smile on his lips, and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's about right.
 Only it really is rye.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rye?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Old family recipe.
 There's a war going on, remember?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan didn't laugh at that last remark, despite Adu's brilliant smile.
 He looked at his emptied glass and asked Adu then with some puzzlement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Family recipe, you said? This place yours, then? This is what you do, sell
 drinks and work with the CIA?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu knit his hands together and smiled, while Nicole sipped at her drink
 languidly, staring at Ethan.
 Adu answered with a careful, concise tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Among other things.
 Whatever the reason, we're here, and there are opportunities all around.
 It's a terrible thing, to waste an opportunity.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I don't really like you.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

You mean businessmen?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No.
 Warmongers.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole closed her eyes and said calmly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ethan, please.
 No need for namecalling.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adu smiled thinly before calmly retorting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This isn't about money, or profit.
 This is about survival.
 I could just as well imply that the British government is doing the same,
 trying to hold on to the oil contracts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We didn't start this war, you know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

But there's only one outcome that suits you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's politics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

So they are politicians, but I'm a warmonger? It doesn't seem fair.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think as much, only from a different point of view.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

But do you really understand why I have to do all this? Stand in the middle,
 play all sides, balance things?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're trying to tell me, you have no other option?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Precisely.
 Someone has to be the voice of reason in a very unreasonable affair,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and grinned before adding with a shrug, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

..war.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I thought you were just selling info this way and that according to what

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Or maybe what suits me.
 Even I can't tell sometimes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Adu said with a grin and looked at Nicole sideways for a moment.
 When she stared back he went on and added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know where to look.
 My job is done.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole shot him a fiery look and told him with icy deliberation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not what we agreed upon.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's not too late to reach another agreement.
 Perhaps it would be much more fair if Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How much?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 blurted Nicole with a flustered face, while Ethan frowned and asked rather
 dully:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How much about what, exactly?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Triple the usual,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Adu casually, casting a fleeting gaze at Ethan who repeated his question,
 this time a lot more convincingly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The fuck what for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Keeping his mouth shut,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Nicole said briskly.
 Adu replied with a annoying grin on his mouth:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Indeed.
 That would be very bad for both of you, wouldn't it? In more than one way.
 Isn't that right, Ms.
 Heurgot?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you said you could trust this man.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Trust is a rare commodity these days.
 The price, and the client, are..
 Flexible,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Adu with a sharp, shiny grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan locked eyes with Adu.
 He had a look of calm determination about him, eyes glinting in the dim
 light of the oil lamp.
 The black man's grin turned into a thin line and a deep frown appeared
 on his face when without warning Ethan reached for his ankle and pulled
 his combat knife with one superbly fluid motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole's eyes widened with shock while Adu's hands were already upending
 the table.
 She only had time enough to cry 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wait!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but Ethan was already off his chair, trying to sidestep the table.
 He went for Adu's arm with a quick jab with the knife, but he missed for
 an inch or so.
 The upturned table hadn't slowed him down, and he was right behind Adu
 who was already thrusting people aside, edging his way towards the bar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sudden commotion made people turn their heads in a snap.
 Nicole jumped off her chair and tried to grab Ethan by the waist.
 Her initial surprise had made her slow to act and she missed him by a few
 inches, grasping nothing but air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within moments, Adu had cleared his way through the tables, smashing glasses
 and brushing aside stunned customers.
 Ethan was only a few steps behind, his knife in hand.
 A quick nod and a moment later, the bartender was leaning behind the counter.
 When saw the movement he instinctively rushed towards the ground in an
 audacious tackle.
 Their feet connected; Adu tripped and suddenly fell sideways at the exact
 moment when a small cloud of wooden splinters, smashed tiles and pieces
 of cloth flew right above Ethan's head.
 The booming sound of a shotgun echoed like thunderclap around the small
 bar; mayhem ensued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shouts and cries mingled with the sudden rush of screeching tables and chairs
 as the panicked customers fled the 'Madimba'.
 Clicking metallic sounds alerted Ethan that the shotgun was being reloaded,
 even as Adu had rolled on his back and turned around to jump on Ethan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With his sudden rush he had managed to pin Ethan's knife hand, but his grip
 was lax, his body badly placed, vulnerable.
 Ethan managed to swing a punch right in Adu's face with his free hand;
 it barely shook him.
 A couple more quick jabs had little effect other than Adu replying with
 a fist right in Ethan's stomach, grunting instinctively as he flexed his
 muscles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan tried to get a hold on Adu with his legs, catch him in a vice.
 He couldn't get a good grip, as Adu was piled up more pressure on his knife
 hand, trying to wrestle the knife away.
 His other hand went for Ethan's neck and met with opposition.
 While they grappled on the floor, Ethan heard a loud shot without warning,
 then another and one more, all in quick succession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd rushing outside reacted to the shots with a louder burst of bewildered
, panicked shouts.
 They were still shouting when he heard the thud of a body falling limp
 against the floor, the sound of smashed glass following its way down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were both surprised and for an instant Adu's attention waned as he
 shot a reflexive look behind him, where the bartender should have been
 holding the shotgun.
 In that single moment his grip became just a tad more lax and allowed Ethan
 to slip his knife hand away with a sudden, violent shove.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Losing the grip on the knife hand, Adu tried to roll over on the floor,
 put some space between them.
 He tried to put his back against the bar, while he reached for someplace
 out of Ethan's sight.
 While he swung his body around, trying to catch Adu from an ankle or a
 leg, he saw Adu's face suddenly go slack, all the tension vanishing in
 an instant.
 His hand stayed for the merest moment still in the air, and then another
 shot was heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This time he saw Adu's whole body flex, quiver and shudder all in the blink
 of an eye before it fell limp against the bottom of the bar.
 Blood trailed down from the hole in his shaven head, now grossly disfigured,
 the cracked skull penetrating the skin.
 Nicole's shouts reawakened Ethan who stood there transfixed for the merest
 second, mesmerized from the puzzled look in Adu's eyes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go! We have to run, now!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan stood up, sheathed his knife and ran towards the stairs right behind
 Nicole.
 He told her then, out of breath:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why, did you shoot him dead? I had him.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

What an idiot! He was reaching for a gun.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I didn't see any gun,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethan said when he stepped outside.
 He could see a few of the customers shouting for any patrol to come to
 their help.
 From the corner of his eye he could see some pointing at him.
 Nicole dragged him along behind one of the walls of 'Madimba' and told
 him in a very strong manner, evidently quite upset:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You can thank me later, you dolt! What kind of an asshole jumps on an informant

\end_inset

Oh, you think?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shouts and the sound of boots and clattering helmets came from the street
 behind them.
 Some of the customers were talking wildly in accented English and French,
 while an authoritative voice wanted them to shut up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They're trying to explain the shots and all.
 We can't go back to the hotel right now,

 said Ethan, licking his lips from his sweat.

Any brighter ideas, then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Die down? Are you- never mind, no time to argue.
 Go!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as the patrol leader shouted orders to his men, still trying to
 gleam an understanding from the terrified white folk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They both ran towards the river bank, trying to use alleys and shadowy paths
 through the irregular maze of Onitsha's neighborhoods.
 Behind them, they could hear echoes of bellowing officers and the muffled
 sound of boots running.
 At each corner they would stop for a breath, then silently nod and keep
 going with the same pace.
 Anxious glances revealed wary eyes from the city folk peeking behind smudged
 windows and decrepit walls.
 They kept running and before long the empty streets gave way to a wild,
 lush vegetation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dusk had already fallen, and with the riverside in plain view, they laid
 low near a thick bush.
 Nicole was out of breath, her muscles burning from the effort.
 She bent over and weighed herself on her knees with sagged shoulders.
 Ethan knelt beside her and surveyed the river bank for a moment.
 She said then with pain written on her face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's it.
 I'm beat,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and a short breath later added, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't go on like this.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan replied with a nod, quite unaffected by the physical strain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The small river barge was dominated by a rather large stack of barrels and
 crates.
 Some had been spray painted with numbers and letters in the same pattern,
 while others were completely devoid of any markings.
 Most seemed battered and frayed, while few seemed brand new.
 As the last light of the day fell around them, it cast a blurred, murky
 reflection of the uneven heap on the water rolling lazily past the flimsy,
 almost flat hull.

 The sound of crickets and buzzing mosquitos were drowned by the monotonous
 `put-put' of the two-stroke motor that somehow managed to barely propel
 the barge.

The Swede replied with a smile that took a moment or two to form on his
 sunburnt face.
 He then added as he peeked behind Ethan at the helmsman, a boy in his teens:

Perspective.

 Ethan nodded and said nothing.
 His gaze wondered for a moment before it fell on the cargo.
 He asked then the Swede:

 asked Ethan with a frown on his brow.

 Ethan drew a last whiff and threw his cigarette in the water before asking
 with smoke coming out of his mouth and nose:

Nicole interjected with a suddenly conversational tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We needed to check with Adu first.
 We didn't know whether the Swede would even have a delivery today.
 See, Adu and the Swede are partners, so to speak,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said with a gleeing smile and fluttered her eyes only for Ethan to
 see, before she threw her head backwards to gaze at the still faint stars
 in the sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His face sat in a frown for a moment or so, before looking sideways at Nicole
 and then back again at the Swede who was looking upwards and bobbing his
 head slightly as if counting in his head.
 He checked his wristwatch; it was almost ten o'clock.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Twenty, twenty-five thousand pounds.
 Give or take,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ethan did not have to act surprised or impressed when he said:

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the Swede to Nicole who simply shrugged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought that..
 Never mind.
 I'm tired.
 I really I am.
 Let's not have this kind of discussion right now.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ethan in a very natural way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not a moment after the Swede went below, Nicole quickly turned her head
 and shot Ethan a look that overflowed with a raging intention for murder.
 She hissed, rather than said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Moron.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan replied calmly, almost non-chalantly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I won't stab this one, don't worry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her nostrils flared with anger instinctively and right before she could
 retort, the Swede came back up, with the radio in hand.
 He tuned the dial first and then turned it on.
 Intense brass sounds and pompous drums came from the small speaker, while
 the Swede seemed instantly gratified judging from the grin on his face.
 Ethan asked him then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard

`Top of the Pops'? Seriously? You want to listen to that, now? Here?

 said Nicole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It won't hurt or anything, will it? I'm a big fan of the Stones.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Swede shrugged and turned the dial, while the selector remained on the
 AM setting.
 Through a flurry of white noise and incoherent sounds, a clear voice could
 be heard from the speaker albeit with some static but nevertheless with
 surprisingly good reception:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

..so until they're ready, let's listen to their latest single to hit the record
 stores, `Hey Jude'!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A loud applause was heard and the announcer's voice was cut crisply, while
 the clapping faded away and soon the voice of Paul McCartney came softly
 through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's brow became a deep furrow.
 He flexed his hands and looked at Nicole with a calm, steady gaze.
 She felt his stare upon her after a moment and looked at him with a quizzical
 expression.
 He shook his head slightly and simply said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I just hate the Beatles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 after which suddenly and least expectedly, the young boy at the helm smiled
 brightly and sang along, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

..naa, na na na naaa, hey Jude...

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* * *
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometime into the night, they had travelled further down the river, mostly
 thanks to the stream rather than tiny motor.
 Nicole had been sleeping soundly for a few hours.
 But Ethan could not, now that he knew Nicole had been lying to him.
 What was worse, he couldn't read what was the truth between her lies.
 She was an excellent shot, and she was well connected.
 Her agenda though still remained conspicuously well-hidden.
 Was she simply working for herself, like the Swede? But to what end? Did
 she really want to find Andy as much as he did? Thoughts like these - and
 some even worse - tugged at his mind like ropes, bogging him down in a
 spiral with no real answers, no clear exit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt it was dangerous to stick close to Nicole.
 But she had saved him more than once so far.
 Whatever her methods and her real purpose, maybe she had put all that aside
 for Andy's sake.
 Maybe she'd explain later, maybe she had as much trouble trusting him as
 he did her.
 Andy was all that mattered, and soon - he hoped - he'd meet the corpse
 of some other unlucky bastard, not Andy's.
 Nicole couldn't really be trusted, but he had to admit to himself that
 she had gotten them this far.
 Andy was all that mattered, and that was what would keep him focused.
 That, and keeping a wary eye on her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The warmth of the night earlier had given its place to a fresh, wet breeze
 that helped him stay awake despite the small hours.
 The Swede had helped with some sort of home-made vodka and stories about
 making even more money when the war would finally end: in the poor light
 the single lamp offered them, he'd shown him sketches and graphs about
 cables and telecommunications, satellites and whatnot, stuff that Ethan
 barely acknowledged they existed.
 Their little discussion was interrupted by the boy who spat out a glob
 of some sort of local chewing tobacco variety and said something in what
 must have been a local Igbo dialect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He caught their attention and turning to look, they saw a flare lazily falling
 down, fading away with a trail of smoke behind it.
 Then another one shot up in the opposite direction further down from the
 east bank and they could almost see a small band of armed men waiting on
 a sandy patch of dirt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's them, two flares, first over the river, the second over land,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the Swede, eagerly telling the boy in what sounded like very bad Igbo
 to cut the engine.
 As the boy complied, he went to the helm and let the stream carry them
 slowly towards the lowered east bank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And the best part is, I don't have to off-load anything.
 They do all the work,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and pointed at the small group of men who were now holding a few
 lit lanterns and waving a torchlight to pin-point their location.
 The more they approached, the clearer it became not all of them were really
 men.
 Most were actually the same age the Swede's helmsman was, and some looked
 shorter, skinnier, every bit younger than the boy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They sent the boys to do a boy's work, no?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the Swede smiling thinly before shaking Nicole gently on the shoulder
 and waking her up.
 In a heartbeat or two she was up, and after a couple of deep breaths and
 a stretch could have fooled anyone that she had slept for almost half a
 day.
 Ethan then asked the Swede, while Nicole bent slightly over the rim of
 the boat and splashed some water on her face:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the Swede said with a sly grin that almost made him look rather slimy all
 of the sudden.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They felt the boat settle on the wet sand with ease, and the boy jumped
 outside holding a flimsy, worn rope that filled the role of a mooring line
 of sorts.
 One of the boys wearing fatigues from the waist down, seemingly accustomed
 to the process, found a nearby mangrove and tied the rope around it.
 Then a man barked a couple of orders and the boys laid down their weapons
 and formed a sort of antline, carefully treading up to the boat where two
 of them had already began unloading the cargo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man in charge wore a full set of fatigues and even sported a red beret.
 When Ethan and Nicole jumped off the boat, he immediately asked them, making
 sure with a wave of his hand that a couple of rifles were already aiming
 at them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

The man shrugged and nodded, before adding in a quite plain fashion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Heard stranger things.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then shouted a few words that must have been names, because two boys
 settled down a crate they were carrying and came over to him.
 A short deliberation later, and after he had pointed at Ethan and Nicole
 quite fervently, they picked up their weapons and motioned with an awkward,
 mixed expression of confusion, fear and faked bravado to follow them.
 The man asked Ethan then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Ethan replied and unfastened it from his wrist, passing it over to the
 man and giving him an unpleasant look that seemed to go completely unnoticed.
 The man weighed the clock in his hand first and then asked Ethan with a
 rather serious tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 he said and licked his lips provocatively.
 Nicole shook her head, while the Swede gave his flask of vodka a swig,
 giggled and snorted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Now, wait a minute!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ethan in what sounded like a poor attempt at passing for the guy with

 He was about to reach for his ankle knife when Nicole burst into laughter,
 and said in-between:

I mean, where's that vaunted, sense of humor, huh? Jesus, Ethan, you take

 the boys to lower their guns as well.

 Nicole then said,

Going up in the world, I see.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon they were sitting inside the cabin of the truck and the last of the
 cargo had been loaded.
 The Swede was waving goodbye as he and the boy turned the boat around and
 headed upstream, when Yenkele started the engine with a powerful rev that
 blanked out everything for a few seconds.
 When the noise died down, he asked Nicole:
\end_layout

Where do I drop you off?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

The morgue,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Ethan uninvited, and Nicole nodded.
 There was a strange look of bewilderment on Yenkele's eyes that quickly
 gave its place to a mild indifference, when he said:

The morgue's pale blue-white neon lights made even the living stand out
 as if they had been just as cold dead as the corpses filling it.
 The whole cooling chamber was actually reserved for important people, like
 officials, dignitaries, and mostly foreigners.
 Somehow to the Biafrans it was really important that a dead foreigner -
 perhaps a journalist or a UN official or a priest with inordinate amounts
 of belief in mankind - received all due care when the time came: a morgue,
 a funeral, a tombstone.
 The rest of the normal people could just die wherever they liked, but not
 the foreigners.

We keep them here, until their relatives and governments are notified.
 Most are claimed, and we arrange the transportation of the body through

 Some though, stay here forever,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said the doctor in charge.
 Nicole asked then, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You can keep a corpse indefinitely?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, I mean they get buried here, in Biafra.
 We can't keep anyone more than two weeks.
 Not a lot of room, anyway.
 But this is a remarkably equipped facility.
 The bodies are kept in cold storage,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said with a slightly awkward smile.
 Ethan said bluntly, impatiently:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Will you just, show us the corpse?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to which the doctor nodded and led the way towards a specific slot, while
 Ethan added 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Un-fucking-believable.
 It's like a bloody farmer's market, isn't it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 He wiped his mouth without a need, suddenly feeling nervous despite the
 fact that he really believed this corpse was simply a useful mistake from
 which they could move on.
 Still, something inside ate at him.
 A quick gaze at Nicole told him that odd feeling came from her.
 The question of why she had lied to him gnawed his mind.

A doctor is supposed to tend to the living, sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the doctor said apologetically, and continued, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'm only saying that because the sight is particularly..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just get on with it, yes, please,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan and the pulled the handle on the small door, opening it carefully,
 almost reverently.
 He slid out the stainless bed with care, revealing the badly charred body
 of a man laying almost comfortably on his back, with a bullet-ridden chest
 almost torn to pieces.
 Nicole gasped at the sight instantly and her face furrowed, while Ethan
 couldn't help wondering at how anyone could identify this man with any
 amount of certainty.
 The doctor spoke then in a professional, easy voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

White caucasian male, judging from the shape of the hips and the cranium.
 Large entry and exit wounds on the chest probably from a high-powered rifle.
 Body stance indicates the fire was irrelevant to the man's death.
 Two gold fillings melted away, both on the right frontal wisdom teeth.
 A broken clavicula, an older wound, possibly as a child.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doctor paused, as if waiting for something from either Ethan or Nicole,
 but they both remained silent for more than just a moment.
 The doctor felt compelled to ask:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does this man seem to be the one you're looking for?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole broke down in sudden tears, sobbing like a little girl then and nodded
 furiously even as the doctor tried to show her the burnt off personal effects
 that were found on the body: Andy's switchblade, his steel-cased watch
 with their father's signature on them, and a badly burnt but still somewhat
 readable passport.
 It was all there, this looked exactly like Andy's body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan stood silent, while Nicole took a step back.
 He took a good, hard look at the charred body lying in front of him.
 Nicole placed her hand on her mouth, and sobbed quietly, respectfully,
 before whispering, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, God..
 Andy..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 .
 Ethan looked at the doctor, and then at the body once more, from head to
 toe, vainly trying to find a sign of life in that piece of charcoal lying
 in front of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at Nicole then with a curious look, as if he had never seen that
 woman before in his life.
 His brother's wife, he reminded himself.
 Something very human inside pushed him to hold her in his arms gently,
 offer a crying shoulder, while a part of his mind raced in the completely
 opposite direction.
 And that part of his mind was the part that was usually right about basic
 things, like keeping out of trouble, dodging bullets and gunfire.
 Instinct made the hair on his back suddenly rise, a chill went down his
 spine when the doctor's words rang once more in his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The medical report; the wisdom teeth.
 He could see the doctor idly fiddling with some sort of report on his writing
 pad.
 He caught a glance of him looking back.
 The doctor tried his best at smiling uncomfortably before fixing his attention
 once more in the writing pad.
 Ethan's eyes looked around the morgue and flipped a few pages in recent
 memory; no X-ray machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That same bone, but no incisions.
 That very same bone, since they were thirteen years old.
 He shot Nicole another weird, expectant look.
 He asked himself then how she could not see it for herself.
 Unless, he thought, she could, and she did.
 Because she must have known as well, and that only meant she was taking
 him for a fool.
 A damn near-sighted, forgetful fool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His heart must've skipped a beat when he heard the doctor ask him rather
 hesitantly:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

He cleared his throat and closed his eyes for a moment.
 He drew a deep breath and said with a reluctant, shy voice, even as Nicole
 threw herself into another fit of sobs:

\begin_layout Standard
The Metropolitaine was filled with newly sworn-in Nigerian recruits.
 Clean-cut and shaven, their new uniforms pressed, they seemed to be having
 the time of their lives; the next day and wherever in the war that might
 take them was a thought for another time.
 Loud roaring laughter mingled with the sound of clashing glassware; some
 danced to the rhythm of half-drunken, clapping hands while other sang on
 top of their lungs.
 One would think that the war had ended, but that wasn't so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
James sat on a barstool on the corner of one bar, sipping quietly at a glass
 of red wine, his eyes peering through the throng of young soldiers as if
 waiting for something to happen.
 Loui was too busy to engage in any of his usually idle chat; he kept filling
 glasses and mugs with no end in sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A white, tall man in his fifties approached James.
 He had a thick grey moustache and piercing blue eyes, set in a congenial,
 friendly-looking face.
 He asked James with an horrible, unmistakably French accent:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Red wine, in this kind of an establishment?

 to which James retorted with a tooth-filled grin:

The two men shook hands fervently and the Frenchman sat down.
 He waved a hand to Louis, but he did not notice him.
 The man turned to James, shrugged and said:

 He then pointed to the crowd of recruits in the Metropolitaine and continued:

 he said and shook his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Gilles, eyeing the soldiers with an inquisitive look though hasty
 look.
 He nodded to Louis who motioned a hand, and almost ran to take his order.
 Sweating, and nearly out of breath, Louis asked him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Monsieur Rafoccat, gin?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Louis and the frenchman simply nodded before asking James with some
 hesitation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Anything new?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
James shook his head and shrugged, his reaction floating somewhere genuine
 ignorance and feigned indifference.
 The frenchman went on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a lot in stake here.
 I don't need to remind you that, do I?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and turned to the bar to get his drink.
 Loui smiled at first, but then saw the look on James face and decided to
 leave the two men entirely alone, leaving without having spoken a word.
 James asked Gilles then, curtly and to the point:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Are you ready then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frenchman seemed a little taken aback, even offended.
 He frowned and a somewhat uneasy moment passed before he answered:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not yet, no.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a sip from his drink and ran it around his mouth before swallowing.
 James nodded to himself before asking Gilles, his voice carrying a hint
 of urgency:

\begin_layout Standard

 replied James with suppressed ire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But you certainly know your way around one,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 retorted the Frenchman, pointing a finger at James, who silently sipped
 at his wine for a few moments, looking pensive.
 He said then hesitantly, looking Gilles straight in the eye.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Of course,

 replied Ethan without hesitation.
 Gilles smiled thinly before saying:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is something else I have wanted to ask you ever since you approached
 us.
 Is it just the money? Or do you really feel their cause is just?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frenchman's tone had a curious ring to it, as if the answer would be
 exhilarating.
 James shrugged and sipped at his wine before answering:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have my reasons, as you have yours.
 Is it your sense of duty? Pride in your work? Love for your country?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gilles seemed to be taken aback once more, James answer in the form of a
 question not fitting in with what he had expected.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's just orders, James,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, and smiled unevenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's never enough,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied James through a thin grin, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Not when your life is on the line, Gilles.
 Is it the dreams, or is it the nightmares that keep you going?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I don't have nightmares, James,

 said the Frenchman shaking his head lightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Everyone has nightmares, Gilles, everyone,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said James and finished his wine in one big gulp.
 He then got up and left without paying up.
 Outside the Metropolitaine, he grinned widely to himself and looked at
 the night sky.
 Heavy clouds hang above; a hard rain would fall.

 He struck Ethan as a man of integrity and good will.
 His words sounded true enough, so Ethan obliged a sincere reply:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Thank you, father,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and nodded pensively, suddenly lost in thought, his eyes fixed
 beyond the mass of people waiting for a meal.
 There was a peaceful murmur in the air, rarely broken by the sound of crying
 children.
 The people that had gathered weren't restless at all.
 He had been expecting something of a riot, and this orderly manner fascinated
 him.
 Nicole must've thought he was still trying to come to grips when she took
 him gently by the arm and said to the priest with a tiny shake of her head:
\end_layout

Nicole nodded skeptically before the lank Igbo priest continued:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He gestured at the small throng of people, mostly mothers with their children,
 as well as old men and quite a few disabled or injured men.
 Some of those had the stare of a wounded tiger, but for most the truth
 was that mines, shells, and bullets are quite oblivious to a man's allegiance
 and unable to discriminate.
 They had simply been unlucky, and with a bitter smile to himself, Ethan
 thought that whole sordid affair reeked of bad luck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can only hope you will consider it.
 I'd hate to force anything upon you, but do not forget, your brother died

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Father Likembe, trying to sound comforting and encouraging but with
 little success this time; his words sounded more like a standard, ready-made
 speech.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole sipped her coffee from a tin and said with a slight dose of uncertainty,
 careful to meet Ethan's gaze casually:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I think I'll stay on, father.
 I don't know for how long, but I feel I should.
 I can't speak for Ethan, but I'll help.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan caught that gaze and remained expressionless for a moment or two.
 He was still trying to discern the from truth in her eyes, her voice, her
 face, but he had proven quiet inept at it so far.
 It helped him though being constantly unsure of her; it enhanced his feelings
 of being distraught, disoriented, confused and wary at the same time -
 because Nicole probably thought he was acting weird because of Andy's death.
 And that should help him find out why she wanted him to think Andy was
 dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The priest smiled thinly and crossed his palms as if in prayer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 just barely:

Nicole has been doing this for a long time, it's part of who she is.
 It's not an easy life, especially for someone like you, I would imagine,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Father Likembe said, clearing his throat and straightening his back at
 the same time.
 He leaned closer to Ethan who was sitting to his left and said with a clean,
 hearty voice as if preaching:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Do not feel unwanted or unwelcome, my son.

Nicole looked at Ethan with a warm gaze, her lips pursed together in a show

 Ethan glanced at the mass of refugees sitting in large rough benches made
 out of trees.
 He nodded then and said:

 She glanced at the priest and said then:

If it's alright with Father Likembe, then.
 Still, you shouldn't stay just because you think Andy would have wanted

'Were' different people.

 Ethan said hoarsely, got up from his chair and walked away into the crowd,
 looking hurt and irritated.
 Nicole shouted his name but he did not turn.
 When it seemed as if she'd go after him, Father Likembe took her by one
 hand and shook his head, his face turned suddenly worried, fearful.

 Father Likembe's eyes narrowed, his voice instictively lowered to a whisper:

 He seemed relaxed, faintly smiling out of sympathy.
 There was a deep, brewing sorrow on the rest of his face.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the heat and the sweat that made sleep that night a particularly
 uncomfortable, bothersome affair.
 Knowing that Nicole had been lying to him ever since they had met though,
 made it nearly impossible for Ethan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He opened his eyes and checked his watch under the dim moonlight; it was
 a quarter past three.
 The night was wet and warm as usual.
 Without a cloud nearby, the sky promised a night without rain even though
 it was the middle of the rainy season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He raised his head and blinked, his eyes adjusting slowly to what little
 light shone through the shadows of the mangroves surrounding the catholic
 mission.
 He got up from the soft hay matress on the floor and leaned to the window,
 resting both his elbows on the sill.
 He saw that most of the refugees had remained; a few pregnant mothers shared
 tents with some large families, while the rest simply slept on the ground,
 sharing thin blankets, mats, rugs and pillows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A faint lamp light shone from a hut next to the church across from the small
 barn-turned-warehouse where Ethan had been sleeping.
 It was the priest's hut, the same man who had tried to convince him to
 leave so eagerly, just like Nicole had.
 The thought a clergy man was in some kind of shady deal with the likes
 of Nicole and her people wouldn't strike him as odd; stranger things had
 happened and no piece of cloth could turn a man into a saint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan decided he had to take a closer look into the hut.
 He scowled for a moment before he put on his trousers without so much as
 a sound.
 He kept his eyes fixed on the priest's hut, and noticed the movement of
 a shadow now and then, a flicker of the flame every so often.
 Someone was working late, and he needed to know who and why.
 Perhaps the priest simply had trouble sleeping, perhaps there was a lot
 more than simply planning rations.

He strapped his combat knife in its sheath around his leg and got outside
 through another window on the far right.
 In the cover of the shadow from a thick, tall mangrove, he managed to nearly
 land on top of a family soundly asleep, all embraced together, curled up
 to protect each other from an invisible threat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he came close enough to the hut, he quickly crossed a patch of dirt.
 He reached the wall of the hut and flicked his gaze around him.
 He couldn't see anyone up and about, but he could hear a man's voice, somewhat
 rugged and deep.
 It sounded like Father Likembe, the difference being that he was speaking
 French.
 He used curt, small bursts of words and had a heavy, crude accent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was some kind of pattern to his speech; he was repeating words in
 a staccato fashion.
 It was as if he was reading something from a piece of paper, a series of
 words and numbers perhaps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he heard the crackle of static, a small pause and another crackle of
 static.
 A radio, double-tapping the transmit button.

 Ethan knew then the father was definitely part of this whole sherade that
 Nicole had put on for his sake.
 And there was probably a lot that could be answered that night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole was supposedly sleeping inside the church along with some women.
 Ethan thought then he should've checked up on her before he'd come to the
 priest's hut; he'd like to know whether or not he should be watching his
 back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He waited for a few more minutes, his eyes checking up on the church, his
 gaze wandering around the camp.
 The only people awake seemed to be himself and Father Likembe.
 How telling that they both seemed to pay him so little attention.
 They probably thought that he'd fallen for everything, hook and sinker.
 Too eager to believe that their plan had worked, too eager to get him off
 their backs and go back to whatever it was he had upset by looking for
 Andy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The more you rush things, the more chances there are for them to go downhill.
 And Ethan would prove it to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the radio crackled once more into life, he heard a few short phrases,
 and then he heard some numbers.
 He counted six numbers, before he heard them being repeated.
 Suddenly he heard the clicking sound of a few switches.
 Father Likembe had powered down the radio set.
 He then counted to fifteen, got up and casually walked straight through
 the half-open door with a half-hearted, visibly forced grin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Evening, Father,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said, even as his eyes darted around the small, unremarkable room as
 if marvelling at it while in fact he was searching for anything that could
 be used as a weapon.
 Father Likembe had barely began to conceal the radio under a thick piece
 of red embroidered cloth used in the services.
 He seemed confounded, surprised, almost embarassed.
 He looked down to his feet before he took off his glasses, folded them
 and placed them in the rather large desk that was the single most dominant
 future in the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 replied Ethan with a calm, conversational tone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The priest nodded silently and produced a bottle of colorless liquid from
 behind a stack of thick books, scribbled papers and ragged notebooks.
 He offered the bottle to Ethan whose mouth curled into a genuine smile
 before he asked the priest:

\begin_layout Standard
Father Likembe's pearly teeth shined under the lamplight as he smiled broadly.
 He made a motion to reach a cupboard to his right.
 The move alarmed Ethan and made him reach for the knife around his ankle.
 The priest gestured with one hand for him to stop, and still smiling broadly
 he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded while his face had become suddenly stern.
 Father Likembe slowly opened the cupboard with one hand, showed Ethan the
 glasses and picked one with each hand.
 He made a little room on the paper-littered desk and set the glasses down.
 Ethan noticed a pad scribbled with letters, numbers, and words, and another
 one, boxed numbers printed all over it.
 A one-time pad, he concluded in his mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The priest didn't seem to care; if anything else his flimsy cover had been
 blown.
 There wasn't really any reason to cover anything up at that point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan picked up his glass and hesitated before having a sip; he saw the
 priest gulp down a mouthful and flinch.
 He followed suit but tried to savour the whiskey.
 He soon understood it for the mistake it was; the burning and the acrid
 smell of the drink hinted at battery fluid or something equally awful;
 Ethan spat out the rest and put down the glass, wiping his mouth in the
 process.
 He looked sick, his expression sour like lemons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How can you even drink that?

 Father Likembe replied with a serene yet prideful voice:

 he said and drank a sip from his glass, his red-shot eyes now staring at
 Ethan intensely.
 Ethan sat with his back against the wall near the desk, and focused on
 the papers and the notes that filled its surface.
 Without turning to look at the priest, he said dejectedly:

 said the priest with an unnerving serenity drawn across his face.
\end_layout

And then they suddenly heard a thin, rising wail that rapidly cascaded into
 a shrieking cacophony that seemed to pierce the skies.
 Ethan's eyes searched sideways through the window for a moment, and barely
 said to himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bloody jets.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that flick of an eye, Father Likembe sprang up from his chair like a
 coiled snake and threw himself against Ethan, both his hands aiming for
 the arm with the knife.
 The sound of jets screeching overhead blanketed everything else, including
 Ethan's surprise and the priest anguished cry of effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half the camp was practically on their feet the moment the jets clearly
 passed overhead, their engines leaving a white hot flare in the now murky
 dark sky.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's blade flashed steel-white in the moonlight as he struggled with
 the priest.
 He could hear the gasps and the instinctive shuffling of feet from the
 still groggy crowd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The priest kicked him hard against his ankle, and he had to fold his leg.
 Trying to compensate for the loss of balance Ethan swerved low and punched
 Father Likembe in the stomach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the thundering roar of the jets seemed to grow distant, a small moment
 of shocked silence preceded the dazzling explosion that threw them both
 off their feet and across the room, through the flimsy wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's ears rang with a high-pitched buzz and he felt his heart thumping
 in his head.
 An exruciating feeling of pain ran down his left side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he struggled to get back on his feet, his eyes caught the jarred glimpses
 of pure panic: mothers screaming and dragging their children alongside
 with them, men craning their necks to find the next trail or engine exhaust
 in the night sky.
 A fire had started out somewhere nearby, smoke and the smell of burned
 flesh being carried aloft into the night.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked around then for Father Likembe and out of the corner of his eye
 he barely had time to see him before the priest knocked him in the head
 with something blunt and heavy.
 Ethan felt his head was about to crack open when he blindly threw a couple
 of quick jabs.
 One of those connected, and made the father stumble before taking a step
 back to have another swing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan drew his wits about him and saw the opening, lunging head first with
 the knife in his hand.
 He swung the knife and fell forward, knocking the priest down.
 Father Likembe tried to squirm away, avoiding to get pinned down by the
 more heavy-set Ethan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was bleeding either from the cut or lacerations from the explosion.
 The blood on his body made him slippery enough and while Ethan was forcing
 most of his body weight on top of the priest, he was slowly inching his
 way towards the base of the hut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan growled and punched him in the face.
 Then Father Likembe threw a hand full of dirt right into Ethan's face,
 and in that split second of disarray and blindness, he freed himself away
 from Ethan and lept with what seemed to be his last vestiges of energy.
 Ethan went right after him, blinking furiously and crying trying to clear
 the dirt from his eyes.

The priest was frantically searching the ground for something, when he upturned
 a stone and drew a shiny, metal object from inside the ground.
 A gun creche; Ethan swung the knife up high and as he forced it down on
 Father Likembe, the father rolled on his back and sent a couple of shots
 into the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He missed wildly, while Ethan swing had teared open his neck.
 Women's shouts and children's cries could be heard anew.
 Father Likembe was vainly trying to plug his gushing wound with bare hands.
 His body was sagged and a small pool of blood had already formed around
 his buttocks.
 His vestments were already a blood-soaked ruin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he spent a moment catching his breath, Ethan saw Nicole smudged and smoked,
 her clothes a ragged mess, rushing towards him through the thinning smoke.
 She saw them lying down on top of each other and went inside the nearly
 destroyed hut without so much as a word.
 Ethan's instincts sprang into action and he rushed right behind her, grabbing
 her from the waist only a few inches away from the cot.

I need a towel, you moron!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 screamed Nicole while Ethan tried to tie her hands behind her back.
 Without letting go of the knife he fumbled and swerved this way and that
 without really grappling her.
 They both fell awkwardly on the cot's torn mattress, and Nicole found the
 opportunity and drove a hell of kick with her bare-footed heel on Ethan's
 foot.
 Flinching from pain, he loosened his grip involuntarily and allowed her
 to spin around and punch him hard across the face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan staggered for a couple of moments and saw her indeed grab a towel
 from the cot and frantically ignore him.
 She hurried close to Father Likembe who was trying to breathe through sputters
 of blood.
 He kept opening and closing his mouth aimlessly as if trying to speak but
 no sound came out of him other than a shallow, hollow roar, like a deathly
 snore.

 Father Likembe's neck as tight as possible without choking him.
 Ethan had remained stunned at how she had completely ignored him.

\begin_layout Standard
A few of the braver men that had remained in the camp, were trying to evacuate
 the women and the children without anyone getting trampled.
 Some were trying to put out the surrounding fires before they became a
 real threat for the church.
 They saw them then near the body of the priest, and shouted something in
 Igbo.
 Ethan looked their way with a puzzled expression as he felt the first drops
 of rain fall on his face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole shouted back in what sounded surprisingly good Igbo, and didn't even
 spare a moment away from Father Likembe.

 he said and traced the knife around her throat in the mockery of a slow,
 ominous ritual.
 The man closest to them seemed ready to plunge forward but hesitated when
 a shrieky, shrill sound signaled a jet passing over them.
 Within moments the night lit up with plumes of fire nearby.
 The light illuminated their faces with the modest warmth of a candle.
 The cries of some unlucky few were dulled by the falling rain.

 she said with a furrowed brow.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I should be the one asking that,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Ethan with an expressionless, sombre face, his features strict
 and unyielding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright, let me talk to them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as the storm continued unabated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She spoke in Igbo, her sentences small and curt but fluent.
 Ethan couldn't understand half of it though; he suddenly wished he had
 taken a much more serious interest in learning the language when he had
 had the chance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was focused on the two men, eyeing them intently.
 They seemed about to say something but had second thoughts all of a sudden.
 The men looked at each other, and then said something that seemed to make
 Nicole uneasy.
 She asked them something repeateadly in a nervous voice, but they didn't
 answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's instinct told him things were about to take an even stranger turn,
 and then the deafening noise of a jet flying-by low blanketed every sound.
 Moments later a grove no more than a hundred feet away erupted in flames.
 A wall of fire rose upwards through the jungle and bathed everyone in light,
 when finally the scattered anti-aircraft guns opened fire, dashes of tracer
 fire going up in the night sky from seemingly random locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, through the corner of his eye Ethan saw a rising shadow on the
 remains of the hut's walls.
 The two men lunged forward and Nicole realised who they were aiming for
 and shouted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Behind you!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was already sweeping about with one leg extended, blindly trying to
 trip the assailant from behind.
 As he did so, he let go of Nicole, ducked furiously and brought the knife
 on his other hand.
 He barely had time to see a tall, burly man in fatigues before he was dragged
 down to the ground.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole had barely enough time to kick one of her now former comrades hard
 in the face, before rolling halfway towards the hut.
 The man screamed in pain and instinctively tried to stem the bleeding from
 his ruined nose.
 The other one staggered for a moment before rushing to Nicole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan grappled with the man in uniform only a few feet away from Nicole.
 A hasty jab with his knife missed and hit nothing but muddied dirt near
 the man's ear.
 He then felt something hit him in the face with the force of a brick.
 His head throbbed with pain and he felt his skull was about to explode.
 When his eyes could focus again, he realised the man had simply hit him
 with a powerful right.
 He heard Nicole struggling but couldn't do anything about that for the
 moment; the brute that had assaulted him rolled over him with all the weight
 of his body and pinned him down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His knife hand became free for barely a moment and Ethan made it count.
 He put as much power into his strike with his arm as the grappling allowed,
 and felt the blade go deep.
 The man on top of him grunted and placed both of his massive hands on Ethan's
 throat; he began to choke him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan felt warm blood pour down on his hand and mingle with the thick rain.
 He heard dulled grunting noises and shouts from Nicole, as he felt a crushing
 pressure around his windpipe and blood rising up in his head and ears.
 He threw another jab with his knife that didn't pierce through; it met
 with bone.
 Then another one, and another one, as the seconds that passed by seemed
 an endless ordeal.
 He couldn't breathe or move, one hand flailing wildly at the man's face
 with no effect, his knife hand all bloodied as each strike buried the blade
 inside the man who would refuse to give up or die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could see the man's icy black eyes staring back at him in the playful
 light from the grove that caught on fire from the napalm only moments before.
 He saw a gleam of fury and zeal; that man would see to killing him first
 before bleeding to death.
 And then he heard a piercing shot but no cry.
 He felt the man buckle and groan, the pressure on his throat relaxing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan turned his head only slightly towards Nicole and saw her lying with
 her back on the ground, drawing the gun in her hand cooly towards the two
 men who plunged towards the gun head-first in a desperate attempt to stop
 her.
 The man with the ruined nose crumbled down first when Nicole fired next,
 hitting him straight in the chest, senting a sputter of blood flying forth
 in a wide arch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bulky man had little life left in him and grew weak, finally letting
 Ethan gasp for air, blood starting to circulate once more.
 Ethan pushed and shoved him aside before slithering his way under his body
 and back on his feet.
 He saw the last man standing punching Nicole hard in her face while with
 his other hand he was trying to break the wrist on her hand holding the
 gun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first few breaths hurt like hell as Ethan's larygx expanded back into
 its normal size.
 He wasted no time; he didn't know why they had turned on her but he knew
 she was all that stood between him and Andy and that was reason enough.
 He rushed him with a primal scream, bent forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Igbo man threw a glance at him but still focused on grabbing the gun
 away from Nicole.
 As he lay on top of her he kicked her with a knee hard against her kidneys.
 Nicole's screamed pierced through the rumbling rain; the pain was mind-numbing.
 She relaxed her grip on the gun reflexively, stretching her fingers for
 only a moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At that moment, Ethan was already hurtling the man on top aside, arching
 his knife for a deadly blow.
 As he did so, the man somehow flicked the gun off Nicole's hand and tossed
 it into a pool of runny mud only a foot away.
 That only allowed Ethan a wider opening, and as they tumbled away from
 Nicole, Ethan's knife found its way with practiced ease into the man's
 heart, straight between his ribs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan saw the man's puzzled expression and his vacant stare before he turned
 his head to see Nicole scrambling again towards the gun.
 She reached for it with a groan, the kick in her kidneys sending pulses
 of pain throughout her body.
 Ethan slipped on the mud before he found enough purchase to leap onto her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he did so, she finally grabbed the gun and breathing heavily brought
 it to bear against Ethan, who missed her for an arm's reach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 she shouted above the thundering roar of the rain and carefully tried to

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as she barely lowered her aim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That tiny slice of time was enough for Ethan to lunge forward as he swiveled
 his torso sideways, trying to present a smaller target.
 The gun didn't go off but a rather hollow click was heard; Nicole was already
 running away towards the burning grove behind them, tossing the useless
 gun away, and cursing:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Merd!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was right behind her, only two or perhaps three steps behind.
 She ran through thick brushes nimbly without looking back, swerving this
 way and that, changing direction as if following an unseen trail.
 Ethan felt he was falling behind, but he couldn't risk throwing the knife
 at her; he had to catch up somehow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In front of the the grove had turned into a smoldering ring of trees and
 bushes, the small nests of fire slowly dying away as rain fell and the
 napalm mix burned off.
 The stench of burned human flesh, an acrid, sickly sweet smell assaulted
 him and made him queasy.
 He kept on running, even though his lungs had started to burn; the gasoline
 fumes from the napalm, and the exertion from the handfight were taking
 their toll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole leapt above small sizzling logs and pools of mud; once or twice she
 slipped and lost her footing only to regain it not a moment too soon, with
 Ethan's hand outstretched right behind her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frustrated and exhausted, Ethan thought she was actually going to get away.
 He made a final push and leapt after Nicole more so in faith and hope;
 as he did so, Nicole stumbled on something on the ground and fell head-first
 on a sheet of thin slippery mud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She tried to get up but Ethan had fallen right on top of her.
 She heard him then, breathing laboriously, probably in as much pain as
 her:

 he said with an authoritative voice, urging Nicole on her feet.
 She saw that she had stumbled on a charred corpse, frozen in a bizarre

 She suddenly became sick, while Ethan produced an extra pair of shoe laces
 from one his pants pockets.

\begin_layout Standard

Up against that tree,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 he said and pushed her, both hands holding her arms behind her back like
 grappling hooks.
 She complied almost meakly, and with his weight he pinned her against the
 trunk of a tree that hadn't been caught in the stream of the napalm.
 He tied her just enough so that blood barely flowed and then grabbed her
 from an arm, before leading her back towards the church.

The bonds that tie
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was almost dawn.
 They were walking slowly, Nicole leading the way while a few feet behind
 her Ethan traced the tiny path in front of them, mindful of his surroundings.
 His eyes darted this way and that with a nervousness compounded by the
 lack of sleep.
 Each tree, bush and grove ahead seemed to him perfect places for an ambush,
 but none carried the tell-tale signs.
 Nature all around them continued to be ever present; the plentiful cries
 of small monkeys and nightbirds mingled with the brushing up of leaves
 from smaller rodents and the occasional snake or lizard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wet ground teemed with rotting vegetation; it was the rainy season after
 all.
 It made walking an unpleasant experience, since the earth below one's feet
 shifted, the feeling of mushy undergrowth around one's ankles weighing
 on every step.
 Ethan had learned his way around such marshy terrain but that did not make
 it agreeable at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A distinctive shrieking cry pierced the air around them and Etha felt a
 sudden swoosh of air.
 His eyes barely caught the glimpse of a bird sweeping up and away into
 the rosy red sky with some small prey wriggling in its feet.

 of the damnable birds, or perhaps something really dangerous to make an
 appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's a forest,

Obofia forest, actually.
 It's more of a swamp, granted, but it's not a marsh.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 It was calculated anger; a precisely tuned show of hate.

 said shaking her head.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said smiling in front of him.
 He then closed his eyes and a moment later punched her in the stomach.
 Nicole let out a grumbling sound and bent down on her knees before she
 threw up her half-eaten dinner from the night before.
 Ethan yanked the rope and she grudgingly obliged, starting to walk after
 she gave him a wary, almost curious sidelook.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

For you, I'd do it for the fucking laughs.
 Move,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan and rattled his jaw before starting right behind her, the rope
 on one hand and the knife on the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bluff up ahead was rather steep.
 The rain from the night before had turned the dirt into slippery, thin
 mud.
 Nicole could find little purchase using solely her feet.
 She grunted as she fought to stand upright and walk at the same time.
 She almost fell down a couple of times but Ethan was right behind her,
 holding her steady whenever the need arose, for no other simpler reason
 than she would drag him down the slope with her if she fell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun came right above the horizon when they settled on the top of the
 bluff to catch their breath for a moment.
 As they both drew in deep breaths, Ethan looked at Nicole derisingly and
 said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

That's not a bluff.
 That was a proper bloody hill.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole gave him a rudimentary nod and squatted, trying to flex the aching
 muscles on her back and her legs.
 From where they stood, a gleam of light came off a thin strand of murky
 water that flowed lazily to the southwest.
 Ethan's gaze followed the motions of the water for a moment, and then started
 surveying the brown and green mass of vegetation in front of him.
 Most of the land was covered in mangroves and oil palms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were small groves of flat, brownish ground that dotted the landscape.
 His eyes caught a glimpse of one such grove where he saw what he'd been
 searching for so long: a large tent, with a red cross inside a white roundel
 painted on top.
 Around it lay scattered crates and sacks.
 A Land Rover lay near the estuary, burned to a crisp, all the way down
 to the chassis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He suddenly felt his hopes rising, and his fears subsiding.
 When he asked Nicole though, it was with reticence in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is that it? Was that Andy's caravan? Out here, right next to that muddy
 river?

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Better than turn up dead.
 Move,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and Nicole complied.
 The slope on this side of the bluff wasn't as big, and going downhill was
 a lot easier.
 The sun was already above the treetops, and the heat was building up fast.
 Ethan wiped his forehead and asked Nicole, while she navigated through
 the thick, swampy bushes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Their caravan was hit on the Biafran side.

 she replied with a flat, indifferent tone.

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan looked at her with a deep-seated frown, before he almost spat the
 words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What the fuck was a Red Cross caravan doing this far down the River in Biafra?

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is Okumu, down south.
 About 3 miles from here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said, roughly pointing to the south with her head.
 They kept moving towards the grove, the morning sounds of the jungle echoing
 their every step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a road for Okumu.
 What the bloody hell where they doing in the middle of this god-awful jungle?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole swung her head around, gazing at the surrounding trees as if they
 were on a sightseeing jungle trek.
 She let out a small, polite laugh before she replied with a lilting, unusually
 fresh-sounding voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can't you smell it?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Smells like a rotten jungle alright.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

There's more to it than the rot.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan took a moment and stood still, holding the rope firmly.
 It became taut soon enough, and Nicole turned around to complain when he
 shushed her, the knife still firmly held in his hand.
 He was sniffing the air, his gaze wandering at the ground around his boots.
 His head leaned to the left and to the right for a few more moments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What are you doing?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Nicole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm trying to use my senses,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said calmly in contrast to his earlier demeanor.
 After a few seconds, he told her:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm telling you, there is no rendez-vous,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said stressing the last word with a purely french accent, while her
 gaze flickered to somewhere behind Ethan for the barest moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was enough to warn Ethan someone was behind him.
 He instinctively swung around, letting go of the rope that held Nicole
 and blindly aiming the blade of the knife for a low stab in the leg.
 As he did so he had time enough to shout, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You cunt!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but he wasn't quick enough to avoid whatever it was that connected violently
 with his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world around him flashed intensely white as he staggered, and in the
 blink of an eye everything went dark as his body met the soft ground.
 The last thing that went through his mind before the lights went out was
 that thing Onko from his last scout team had told him in their last drill:
 he was growing soft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* * *
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He opened his eyes to a room filled with darkness, except for a narrow slit
 of light from the door.
 The air was stale and damp; it smelled of oil and rust.
 Ethan's eyes adjusted to the dim light and looked around; he could barely
 make out the rough edges of crates, vanes and pipes pouring out from the
 wall next to the door.
 A sharp smell assaulted his senses suddenly; cordite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was lying down with his back against the wall.
 He flexed the sore muscles on his feet, and something weighing them down.
 He heard the sound of rustling chains; he was in shackles.
 Whoever these people were, they weren't taking any chances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The back of his head brushed against the wall; the concrete was coarse but
 warm.
 The temperature was tolerably hot, but the humidity felt like it could
 choke him.
 Surprisingly enough though, he was still alive.
 He smiled bitterly to himself; the thought that he had taken the risk to
 follow Nicole into a trap didn't trouble him as much as the fact that he
 had actually fallen for it like an amateur.
 Whatever would happen next, he felt so far away from ever finding Andy
 again.
 Right about the time when he thought he was so close.
 When he knew his brother was alive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thoughts were then suddenly interrupted when he heard voices from outside
 and the clanging sound of boots on a metal floor.
 He could hear two male voices exchanging a few words in French.
 He then heard the sound of a lighter, followed by the echo of steps moving
 away.
 The guard on the door had been changed.
 Whatever kind of facility he was being kept prisoner, there seemed to be
 lots of Nicole's friends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had taken away his watch, his boots and naturally his knife and Browning.
 They'd been thorough enough to search his socks and rip the pockets out
 of his shirt and trousers.
 In a perhaps strange bout of decency, they hadn't left him naked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The small storage room gave away few clues about his whereabouts; it could
 be underground, or in some old, disused building.
 Wherever he was though, there was ample humidity but there was nothing
 special about that.
 He could still be somewhere near the river, or in a remote part of the
 jungle.
 Perhaps he was being held somewhere in the Delta, further south.
 He decided he should wait; someone would bring him some food and water
 eventually.
 If they wanted him dead, Nicole had had ample opportunities before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His thoughts wandered then to James.
 Everything suddenly seemed to rest on him then.
 When he came looking for him and Ethan was nowhere to be found, what would
 he do? What could James really do, other than perhaps explain to the service
 that there was a bloody good reason for being declared AWOL, that he really
 was missing somewhere in the jungle, not knowing if he'd ever return

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without knowing exactly where he was, and with no clue about how long he'd
 been out, the LZ could be days away.
 And even if by some stroke of luck or genius that he couldn't really bother
 to believe in at that time, even if he did somehow escape, there was no
 telling whether he'd on time.
 No, he corrected himself.
 If they'd be there in time.
 Him and Andy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because if he was being held captive in this place, there was a good chance
 Andy would be around as well.
 Unless they had a whole network of caches, outposts and storage facilities
 made out of concrete, he could very well be in the next room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outside, he heard someone approaching once more.
 The steps sounded different than before; more quiet, less pronounced.
 Someone with a smaller, lighter build.
 Once the sound of steps stopped, he half-expected whoever was outside to
 have a talk, perhaps a routine check.
 He heard nothing of the sort, but instead the sound of heavy metal locks
 clanging and bars lifting and grating could be heard.
 Soon the door opened and let light shine through brilliantly.
 The sudden contrast between darkness and light made Ethan flinch away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then blinked furiously for a while before taking a look at the door with
 some reticence.
 A shapely shadow obscured some of the light.
 When he looked up, he saw Nicole holding a keychain in hand.
 She then pushed the door wide open to reveal the form of the guard, an
 Igbo by the looks of him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What had at first looked like a bath of shiny and brilliant light revealed
 itself to be nothing more than a sickly yellowish light bulb.
 Nicole simply nodded and the guard stood behind her holding his rifle with
 both hands, the butt of the stock extended, ready to smash a couple of
 bones if the need arose.
 They were indeed handling him very carefully, even though he had no great
 misconceptions about his place there and then.

 she replied flatly.

 Ethan stood on his heels and stretched; he felt his blood circulating more
 freely now, and flexed his arms and legs.
 The guard then made a sudden motion towards him that was only interrupted
 by Nicole's palm.
 The look on the Igbo guard told Ethan that he should stick to simply walking
 for the time.

Ethan went outside to put on his boots.
 There he saw another two men standing guard on a small corridor to the
 left.
 One was having a smoke, while the other one was chewing on some leaves.
 Both wore a mix and match of fatigues and loose shirts, green-hued and
 quite appropriate for the jungle.
 These men looked like irregulars but they had the air of a trained soldier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Ethan put on his boots, Nicole gave the men a nod and made a hand
 signal.
 They both nodded, took a last look on Ethan, turned the other way and left.
 Behind Ethan stood the Igbo, safely a couple of paces behind.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of Nicole's men had spoken a word or asked a question.
 That meant they'd been together for some time; whatever these people were,
 they didn't seem like a rag-tag crew of rebels on the run, looking for
 some quick, hard exchange.
 They looked like a unit; a cohesive, well-disciplined military unit.

 said Nicole and pushed him gently down the corridor.
 Ethan started walking towards what appeared to be daylight coming down
 through a shaft.
 This then was a small underground complex.
 He walked past two corridors that seemed to turn after a few yards.
 He knew that every piece of detail might save his life later on, even if
 Nicole was trying to convince him all this looked like some sort of terrible
 misunderstanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't seem to care though about using a mask or hood so as not to divulge
 sensitive info about their facility.
 Whether or not they knew he was trying to put every detail in memory, they
 were either too sloppy or overconfident

.
 And these were both qualities that never paid off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corridor had a low ceiling and was wide enough for three, maybe even
 four people.
 They passed through a part of the corridor that was littered with mechanical
 equipment, tools, rods, and all sorts of metal boxes with screens and dials.
 Electronics equipment from the looks of it, probably communications but
 not some sort of radio he was familiar with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As they came closer to the open hatch that led to the ground he could feel
 a waft of fresh air.
 Warm though it was against his face, it was welcome change.
 As he stepped on to the ladder, he could see the guards waiting for them
 outside, one rifle aimed straight at Ethan and the other one at the hip,
 searching for a threat from their perimeter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he was out and on his feet, he could see nothing other than a wide,
 frothing river with small isles dotted in its flow.
 There was a small fishing hut build right on the sandy estuary, and a couple
 of sand-blasted boats.
 Right behind him he heard Nicole's feet tousle the thick grass.
 She had taken off her shoes, holding them in one hand.

 between a hillock of mangroves and a small farm of oil palms.
 Built in early French colonial style, it looked impressively well-maintained
 and almost picturesque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He noticed more guards, two on the first floor and two more on patrol around
 the farm.
 These were dressed in plain, simple peasant clothes, practical for the
 heat and unassuming.
 They didn't carry rifles, but he noticed they all had a machete sheathed
 across their backs.
 One of them carried a handgun, its large grip protruding from one of his
 pockets.

 Andy smiled and sipped some of his Earl Gray as if he'd been saying nothing

thick bushes surrounding the little mansion.
 It was almost idyllic, aside from the fact that the single largest store
 of ammunition and weaponry on Biafran soil was comfortably hidden away
 beneath.
 Andy took a slice of mellon in hand and bit into the ripe insides, juices
 running down his well-trimmed beard.
 He talked with his mouth full.
 He was trying to chew, swallow and wipe his mouth at the same time:

The inside of the mansion was decorated in classic early-colonial French

 Intricate, expensive looking vases and crystal glassware showcases could
 be seen on either side of a large hallway.
 Louis XV furniture and large portraits of family members filled in the
 living room; every corner was designed to instill a sense of luxury, and
 money.
 Even the floors were made of high-quality spotless wooden planks, polished

 The tapestry was an odd mix of geometric shapes and fleurs-de-lis.

 At the bottom of the stairs they reached a wide basement with a low ceiling.
 Andy turned the lights on and the shadowy walls turned into a maze of maps,

 The rest of the basement was filled with neatly stacked crates.
 On the far wall there were two large radio sets and a large map of the

No, Ethan.

 Because there's still large fields that haven't even been drilled, much
 less taken real advantage of.
 Because there's still a lot of pipelining to do in these blasted swamps

 Because the Delta is like a bloody sponge soaked in oil, waiting for someone

 And with a little help, lots of cries and propaganda, some bloodshed and
 a bit of luck, the French government could secure what might possibly prove
 to be the largest supply of oil in Africa.

 replied the sergeant and after a short series of buzzing and clicking sounds,
 the voice of an older man came on.
 He spoke English with a frail, nasal tone, as if every word required an
 effort.

 came the reply, filled with finality.

\begin_layout Standard
James nodded silently and hang up slowly.
 He turned around then and peeked through the window blinds; he saw the
 garden plaza, and the same, tiny swarm of men that he saw everyday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
They haven't got a clue.
 Poor bastards.

He sighed, picked up the phone receiver and dialed a single digit.
 An operator came on the line, and James told him in his a professional,
 strict manner:

\begin_layout Chapter
Family affairs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan slept on and off that night, trying to digest the events of the day
 before with little success.
 At the hidden basement the night before, he had overheard some sort of
 loud argument about whether or not he should be bound and returned to his
 impromptu cell.
 Instead, Andy had won over and Ethan was then led by two armed men to the
 upper floor and confined to a small bedroom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were going with the soft approach; Ethan smiled at the thought that
 Andy was trying to get on his good side.
 Whether it was the easy way or the hard way, in essence it made no difference
 to Ethan; as he lay down on the comfortable bed all he could think of was
 that his brother had actually told him himself he was a bloody spy for
 the French.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mind was filled with all the little things they did together when they
 were still only children.
 Andy's answers had left him wondering still.
 When did his brother turn into a man driven by greed and power lust? When
 did that shy kid he had drawn into harmless mischief so many times become
 such a cynical bastard?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan thought it was perhaps all those years in between that grew them apart;
 when he had lost himself as well.
 Maybe these things just happened.
 But still, that didn't mean he had to let them be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost laughed aloud when he thought about it; there he was, imprisoned
 by his brother, probably about to be executed unless he cooperated in an
 assasination for the benefit of the French Intelligence Service.
 And instead of at least trying to think of a way to get out of there without
 having to become a lackey for the French, he was contemplating ending the
 war single-handedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He wasn't sure if it was at all realistic, but he knew he had to try an
 escape.
 He had been keeping count of the days; James would be coming for him by
 nightfall, and all he knew was that he was someplace east of the River.
 No matter, he thought; with any luck, getting to the rendez-vous point
 would be the least of his problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He felt galvanised into action all of a sudden and sprang out of bed.
 He took a careful look outside the window; he could still see sentries
 posted around the house.
 Late the night before, they had been almost invisible; in the morning,
 Ethan could see they were carefully obscured behind brushes of reeds and
 thick mangroves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They looked calm while keeping vigilant, their hands resting near their
 rifles' safeties.
 They were armed with a multitude of seemingly well-maintained weapons;
 no-one was slacking about, smoking or chatting.
 He counted at least four men; he estimated about ten around the mansion,
 and perhaps double as many underground and in the surrounding higher ground.
 On top of being well-equipped and numerous, they seemed to be quite disciplined
, always a very unwelcome trait in an enemy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daylight wouldn't help, and he couldn't wait out for the nighttime; he cursed
 under his breath for being so tied up with his thoughts the night before.
 If there had been any good chance of trying to slip away unnoticed, it
 was by then long gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had heard footsteps outside his door at some point, and they seemed to
 be more than one man posted outside.
 He couldn't outrun them, and he couldn't outgun them either; all he could
 hope to do was outsmart them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked around the room then for a few minutes.
 There were some clean sheets in the closet drawers and that was just about
 it.
 There was an old oil lamp sitting around the bedside table and that was
 about it.
 He went inside the bathroom and searched the tiny cupboard; planning ahead,
 someone had thought it prudent to keep a full medical kit even in the mansion,
 aside from the typical bottle of painkillers and medical alcohol.
 He noticed the painkillers were of the effervescent kind, and had an idea
 that made him grin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He sat down on the bed, his back towards the door.
 He laid it down in front of his feet and counted the items; four medical
 gauzes, two sticks of morphine, two sticks of atropine, a sterile stitching
 needle, salt tabs, and a small, foldable double-edge serrated knife which
 could double as a small saw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He nodded to himself reassuringly and emptied the bottle of alcohol down
 the washing basin's drain.
 He filled it with water from the faucet and went back into the room.
 He laid himself down on the bed, and popped a mouthful of pills into his
 mouth.
 He then poured some water in his mouth and felt the pills sizzle and froth.
 He then threw the oil lamp on the floor, and put the knife under his buttocks.
 He closed his eyes and started thrashing about, making sure he made as
 much noise as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then started counting silently, waiting for them to come rushing in.
 There was still a chance they'd alert someone else as well; he was counting
 on blind luck and a bit of panic to make this happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
he had counted up to seven before he heard a key turn in the lock.
 They were a bit slow to make up their minds but they hadn't started shouting.
 Ethan heard them talking in a panicked, low voice.
 One of them rushed to the bedside.
 As he was thrashing, Ethan fluttered his eyes, while foam flowed down his
 cheeks.
 He saw the guard kneel down to his right, and set his rifle against the
 wall.
 As he bent forward to reach Ethan's mouth in fear of his tongue blocking
 his breath, Ethan snapped into action with one fluid motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pulled the knife from under his buttocks, sat suddenly upright and threw
 his best shot at the guard standing by the door; the knife pierced his
 temple right between the eyes, and stuck there as he slumped down on the
 floor like a puppet with cut strings.
 Following the knife's throw, Ethan took advantage of the other guard's
 stunned surprise and smacked him, head to head.
 As he was kneeling down, he lost his balance and fell flat on the floor
 with a muted thump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was right on top of him in a flash, his hand against his mouth.
 He tried to shout, but the muffled noise was barely more than a tremor
 against Ethan's hand.
 He bit hard against a soft spot on Ethan's palm, and punched him in the
 stomach.
 Ethan flinched and felt dizzy from the pain, but his other hand was already
 reaching for the rifle against the wall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guard threw a punch with his other fist aiming for Ethan's face but
 it didn't connect, as Ethan slid sideways just a notch and grabbed the
 rifle.
 He thrusted its stock against the man's ribs and made him try and fold
 in pain.
 Ethan then raised it above his head and brought it down with as much power
 as he could gather.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cracking noise was heard and the man went suddenly limp, his eyes stuck
 in a deathly cold stare towards the ceiling.
 Blood started to ooze from his nose and ears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan took a moment for some much needed breath, not so from the exertion
 but because of the adrenaline.
 He needed to cool down before going into the next phase, which was creating
 a suitable diversion for his escape; blowing up the stores in the basement
 of the mansion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stood up and sat back on the bed, wiping the foam of his cheeks.
 He then heard a shallow but familiar voice:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was Andy.
 Ethan instinctively grabbed the rifle in front of him and aimed it at his
 brother who was standing at the door.
 He flicked the safety off, and said flatly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan frowned and looked blatantly confused.
 He was still aiming Andy though when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Look, I'm leaving through that door.
 Andy, for the love of God, don't try to stop me.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Stop you? I'd have you killed all along from the start if I needed to stop

 Jesus, Ethan.
 Put down that rifle and help me drag this one inside,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Andy as he proceeded to grab the slumped body from the armpits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's confounded look was exaggerated by his dumbstruck tone of voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What the fuck do you mean?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy looked at him with a blank expression and replied in all seriousness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's English for `put down that rifle and help me drag this one inside'.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attempt at humour went largely unnoticed by Ethan who lowered his weapon
 before asking incredulously:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're helping me escape?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy dragged the body a few feet inside while Ethan watched as if mesmerized.
 He put it down on the floor and closed the door quietly before turning
 to reply with a grin:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, not yet; you're helping me blow this place up first.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan asked with a hint of irony, still clutching the rifle in his hands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy shook his head and replied with a tone of pride:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

This was the plan pretty much from the start.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan put down the rifle and looked at Andy with a blank expression.
 He sounded helpless when he said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I don't understand.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy looked behind him momentarily as if he had heard something and then
 said, looking almost smug:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I hate to brag but you weren't the brightest of the two.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan got up and moved towards the body with knife still sticking out of
 its head.
 He eyed his brother warily and asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Care to explain? Did your deal break down?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy knelt beside the other body and checked for vital signs.
 He looked at Ethan and replied as if trying to explain something very complicat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not exactly.
 I infiltrated the French Secret Service in '62, and placed myself in a
 position to select the assignment in Biafra.
 I set every part of this operation up in order to close it down when it
 would most needed.
 I'd waited for a few more weeks, but then you turned up.
 So now I've got to speed things up and improvise.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who did you expect, Sean Connery?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Andy almost indignantly and smiled reassuringly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan smiled back with some effort and asked his brother:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It was all a show then?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy looked at his brother in a stern fashion, as if he'd been hurt, and
 told him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I told you to really try and think about Father Mulcahey.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I thought you were being a bit remorseful,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Ethan in a somewhat awkward manner.
 Andy came right next to him and grabbed him by one arm, looked him straight
 in the eyes and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought you hadn't forgotten about what he made us promise.

Ethan felt a weight suddenly lift from his shoulders, and replied with a
 shake of his head:

I haven't, Andy.

Ethan nodded and said calmly:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A blessing in disguise, because we've got work to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They dragged both bodies inside the bathroom before locking the bedroom
 door.
 Andy said to Ethan:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've got about half an hour before someone comes to check up on you.
 It might look like a lot of time but there's a lot to do.
 We'll be cutting it close,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and produced a length of rope.
 He then told Ethan:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come on, give me your hands.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You're going to tie my hands?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ethan with wariness in his voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're supposed to be the prisoner, remember? Just because they're sentries
 it doesn't mean they're that thick.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded silently before he replied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Makes sense.
 What did you have in mind?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said while Andy loosely tied his hands together, making sure Ethan could
 easily pull on some of the rope and loose it completely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy checked the finished knot around Ethan's hands, raised his brow and
 said in a professional, neutral manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Blow everything up, basically.
 I'm not sure how much you've seen but there's about a mile of underground
 corridors and rooms filled with a couple millions of rounds of ammunition.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Time detonators?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 asked Ethan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Slow fuses.
 Then we really need to get going.
 With any luck we'll be a mile out when everything lits up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Guards, patrols? From what I've seen these guys mean business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There are sentries at the entry and exit points of the underground complex.
 There won't be much of a problem as long as we keep ahead of the two patrols.
 They're doing runs across the perimeter and checks on the inside as well.
 They meet up at the entry point.
 If all goes well, we should have about fifteen minutes once we go inside.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

 whispered Ethan instinctively as he followed downstairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Yes, I mean Nicole,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 replied Andy with some irritation and added:

You don't have to whisper, the house is empty.

She's keeping secrets as well?

\begin_layout Standard

It's just that she roams about when she's back here; checking up on the

They walked casually out the front door of the mansion, Ethan in front and
 Andy in the back with a pistol in hand.
 The guards saw them but paid little attention, their heads spending most

Don't talk.
 Prisoners are never allowed to talk, and you, especially you can't be an

 Ethan stopped, turned his head around and looked at Andy angrily for a
 moment, on which Andy commented:

Ethan did not reply, but still walked onwards.
 Andy checked around them for any sign of one of the patrols going inside

 They were walking casually but briskly, trying not to appear too hasty
 without good reason.
 Around them the sound of the river rushing by dominated the rest of the
 voice of the jungle.
 The animals had felt the rain coming as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They approached the guard at the entry point, who asked Andy something in
 Igbo.
 The guard wore an unusually wide grin, and made shooting gestures with
 his rifle.
 Andy replied tersely, and the guard stopped his little act, and replied
 curtly.
 Andy nodded, the guard opened the metal panel and grabbed Ethan by the
 arm, forcing him to step on the ladder and get below.
 Ethan used his fingers to grab onto the small metal bars of the ladder.
 Another man was guarding the foot of the ladder, silently watching Andy
 and Ethan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foot of the ladder was well lit, near an intersection of the complex.
 Ethan remembered how he'd been led here when released from the machinery
 room where he'd been kept for a while.
 He could confidently find his way over there, even though the corridors
 looked almost identical.
 The lights were on, powered from a generator somewhere but there were blind
 spots from burnt out bulbs.
 The dank, cool air had an oily feeling about it; it smelled of cordite
 and gasoline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan and the guard exchanged a few looks, the guard seemingly checking
 him up from head to toe.
 Ethan seemed like an angry animal trapped in a cage: he sported a razor-sharp
 gaze, fidgeting and looking pumped-up.
 The guard glanced once or twice at the knots in his hands, but Andy stepped
 between them and asked the guard in Igbo.
 His voice had an anxious, urgent quality.
 The guard seemed uneasy, shaking his head and answering in a monotone.
 Andy repeated the question with emphasis, while the guard on the surface
 closed the panel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the panel had been sealed, Andy nodded to Ethan who instantly pulled
 on the rope and let loose his hands.
 The guard's eyes went wide with surprise, but even as he tried to shout
 and push Andy away, his mouth was already covered and Andy's knee was already
 connecting powerfully with the guard's genitals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guard folded from the pain, and let out a muffled groan.
 Ethan sprang up on him from one side and caught his head in his hands.
 With a quick, expert motion, he violently turned the man's head around
 and a snapping noise was heard.
 The guard went limp and they both quickly and quietly dragged him to the
 near end of the corridor, where a soft shadow kept the body somewhat hard
 to notice from a distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy checked his watch and nodded for Ethan to follow him.
 They picked up the pace and were soon jogging inside the complex, seemingly
 on a random route.
 They kept passing by locked and barred doors, when Andy suddenly stopped.
 He produced a small keychain and quickly selected a key.
 Ethan kept looking back and forth for any sign or sound of a patrol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy unlocked the door and quietly raised the bar and set it aside.
 He opened the door and flicked open a switch.
 A warm yellow lamplight filled the room and they both went inside.
 It was a large storage room, with crates of various sizes neatly stacked
 and arranged.
 Andy's eyes quickly scanned the room, searching for something in particular,
 his right index finger hovering in the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then pointed to one corner of the room and said to Ethan, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There's a crowbar lying around there somewhere.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy then showed him a particular crate and told him, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Open that one up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan found the crowbar, while Andy was rummaging about in another side
 of the room, as if sorting something by hand.
 Ethan opened up the crate to reveal a tightly packed array of small brown
 bricks.
 He carefully removed one and examined it with curiosity.
 He then asked Andy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A crate of Semtex?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said as he casually checked the labels on the other crates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So that's the right one, eh? That was supposed to be used in wrecking the
 Onitsha bridge,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answered Andy, lost behind a series of crates.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We'll have to move it to another room.
 And we'll need some oil barrels as well,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 continued Andy, his voice strained from the physical exertion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Alright, I can carry this.
 Have you got the fuses?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Ethan as he fumbled with another box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy finally reappeared sporting a thin grin and a thick bundle of a white,
 waxy rope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We're done here,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Andy and checked his watch once more.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We've got about five minutes.
 We'll have to lay down the fuses, and wait the patrol out.
 Then we jump them,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Andy as he straightened his glasses, turned towards the door and stood
 frozen still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole had just entered the room with a knife in one hand, and a gun in
 the other.
 She was aiming at Andy, her face impossibly torn between anger and sorrow.
 She trembled visibly when she spoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What would you do with me, Andy?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy turned around and looked at her with a hint of guilt.
 He took a step closer instinctively before trying to reply.
 Nicole placed her sights squarely against him, a couple of feet away from
 his forehead, while Ethan turned slowly around, trying to edge himself
 closer to her.
 She swapped targets at blinding speed, and told Ethan:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need answers.
 Hands were I can see them.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Put the gun down, Nicole.
 I know I should've told you.
 It just wasn't the right time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Andy with a sorrowful, earnest voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is there a right time?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Nicole, her eyes wet already from a film of tears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Put the gun down before we're vaporized,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 interjected Ethan.
 It made Nicole laugh bitterly, before she answered, sniffing her noise
 lightly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can put a bullet on a man's head a mile away.
 Don't worry, I won't hit anything else other than you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan took a side step and revealed his hand was holding a small metal box,
 with wires stretching away from it, set right into a block of semtex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You want answers? That's fine, I'd like some answers myself.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole's expression turned into one of anxiety.
 She gripped her gun with uncertainty, while she was starting to sweat.
 She kept her eyes fixed on Ethan without saying a word for a few moments.
 Andy told her then, with as much truth as he could muster in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Come with me.
 We'll leave this life behind.
 I'll quit the Service.
 They'll debrief you, give you a new name, everything.
 We'll get lost somewhere in the world, start over.
 If I can't have anything, I must have you, Nicole.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why didn't you say so from the start, Andy? I'd hoped the source was wrong.
 But no.
 All my years of work, thrown out the window.
 For you, non?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said trembling, her voice wavering like that of a scared child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought I could keep it professional.
 I thought I could just work you, like you were trying to work me.
 But I just couldn't, Nicole.
 Could you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 asked Andy passionately, looking as if he was lost into her eyes.
 She whispered almost inaudibly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Non,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and her brow furrowed as she seemed to soften up, giving in to a feeling
 she could not contain.
 But her gun was still aiming at Ethan, who cut in with a polite, little
 laughter and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're holding a gun, I'm holding a detonator, and you want to have a little
 moment? This is outrageous! Listen, we either all walk away, or no-one
 does.
 My choice, really,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan sounding smug and confident.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go on then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Nicole before she turned to look at Ethan with a furious, mad gaze.
 She went on and said with abandon:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go on, push that trigger.
 All I want to know is he loves me.
 That Andy loves me.
 We used each other.
 He lied.
 I did too, at first.
 But I thought, he meant everything he said and did.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not everything, love.
 I took an oath, and I never break them.
 I took an oath to you as well, and I won't break that one either.
 Come with me now, please,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Andy with an unseemly pleading tone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can't, Andy.
 Ce n'est pas possible.
 How can..
 How can I trust you now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said, fresh tears flowing down both her cheeks.
 Andy replied without hesitation, a fiery conviction in his voice, an immaculate
, fearless shine in his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look into my eyes.
 Look into my eyes and tell me that you don't want to trust me.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Je ne peux pas.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her voice was cut in mid-sentence as her eyes went wide with shock, and
 she gasped for a little air with her mouth wide open.
 She half-turned her head to see Ethan next to her, feeling the gun in her
 hand slip away.
 Ethan had stabbed her in the stomach, the unimaginable pain rising up from
 her belly to numb her senses.
 Andy grabbed her with his arms as she couldn't stand on her feet and screamed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no, wait! Wait!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan grabbed the fuses and told Andy:

We need to move.
 She might've warned everyone already.
 We have to go now, Andy!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy seethed with furious anger, even as he laid Nicole down up against
 a wall.
 He shouted at him even while Nicole bled profusely from her belly, her
 face going visibly pale even under the yellowish lamplight:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What the fuck were you thinking?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

She was coming with us, damn you! Damn you, Ethan! She was!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cried Andy, barely able to control a rising well of sobs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole looked at him with her large eyes, her pupils dilated.
 She caressed his cheek with one feeble hand, before she whispered to him
 with real effort:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I wouldn't Andy.
 Not now, not ever.
 But I still love you..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said as she went into shock and fell unconscious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no.
 I have to..
 I need to get one of the kits, powder, bandages..
 Stop the bleeding..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 murmured Andy loudly as he still held Nicole in his arms.
 Ethan was overlooking the corridor, still seeing nothing alarming.
 He looked at his brother and saw his earlier calm and professional self
 had turned into some sort of living wreck.
 He grabbed him by the shoulder gently and knelt down, came face to face
 with Andy and spoke softly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There was no other way, Andy.
 The way things turned out, there was no other way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Fuck you, Ethan.
 For God's sake, she's not dead yet!
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Andy with a sob.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

She said so herself, she wouldn't.
 You loved her, I can see that now.
 But she knew and could choose not to try and stop you.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It doesn't fucking matter now, Ethan.
 You killed her.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll have to live with that too.
 Don't let it go to waste, Andy.
 Let's fucking move,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan with urgency and Andy looked at him in a strange, awkward fashion.
 He told him then in a choked, sobbing voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No-one behind, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's just us brothers now, Andy,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan and his brother nodded as if mesmerized.
 He made the sign of the cross and kissed Nicole on the forehead before
 he got up.
 He then picked up the crate of semtex and followed Ethan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them moved silently, working as a team who knew exactly what
 to do from before hand.
 Ethan kept a wary eye waiting for a patrol to come looking, feeling like
 they had already ran out of time.
 Andy moved like a machine, and led them to a storage room which was filled
 to the brim with cases full of dynamite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan began laying down blocks of semtex around the storage room, while
 Andy worked like a machine, running the fuse to many different cases, making
 sure at least one would eventually light up, and then the semtex would
 go off and that should be enough for the next room filled with fuel barrels
 to burn up in an explosion and the ensuing fire that would obliviate everything
 and everyone not just inside the complex, but certainly above as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan checked his watch while Andy laid the last of the fuses.
 The patrol was actually a little late, but when Ethan took another look
 outside the door down the corridor, he saw two men walking towards him,
 and suddenly stopping and aiming their weapons.
 They started shouting in Igbo, while Ethan shook his head and raised an
 open palm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The guards were now starting to shout with outrage, and kept coming closer,
 demanding some sort of explanation or identification that Ethan had no
 hope of providing.
 Instead, he remained as apathetic as possible and when the guards came
 within thirty feet or less, he suddenly pulled his Browning and knelt in
 one motion.
 The guards saw Ethan draw the gun, and let fly a burst of rounds.
 But they were aiming from shoulder-high, and their shots missed wildly,
 chunks of concrete flying off the walls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan ignored the shots against him and aimed calmly at each guard, placing
 three shots against each of them.
 The bullets met their targets at the chest and stomach in an almost identical
 fashion.
 The guards fell backwards as if they'd been hit by a truck, while one of
 them let fly another burst from his AK-47.
 Ethan shouted to Andy while reloading the magazine with bullets from a
 case of ammo in the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

We're made.
 Are you done?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Done,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 said Andy flatly as he appeared through the door, holding the rest of the
 fuse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good, light it up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan as he checked the corners for signs of more men.
 Andy replied slowly, as if awaking from a deep slumber:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Light up the bloody fuse and let's make a run for it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Well, like this it's only going to give us a couple of minutes at the most.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Better run fast enough then,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 replied Ethan and looked at Andy with a wild-eyed gaze as he took out knife,
 cut out most of the rest of the fuse Andy was holding, and lit up the rest
 with his cigarette lighter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Go!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he shouted and ran in front, while Andy swore under his breath and ran
 behind him.
 He shouted rough directions to Ethan who already had an instinctive idea
 about where the exit lay.
 Half a minute later, they were running down the exit corridor.
 There were two men at the feet of the ladder barely visible in front of
 them.
 Another two were already climbing down when Ethan let out a few carefully
 placed shots that seemed to miss wildly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two Igbo guards seemed to be taken by surprise seeing Andy running alongside
 Ethan, but the reality of flying bullets made them start shooting only
 a moment later.
 They were trying to aim steadily, but they were on full burst; the awesome
 kick of the AK-47 sent the bullets flying wildly around the walls and the
 ceiling, and almost miraculously missed both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, they both unleashed a flurry of single-action shots, without
 stopping or even slowing down their run.
 The shots struck home, as jets of blood seemed to eject from one man's
 torso and the other man's both legs.
 They had lost their balance falling on the ground, barely alive, screaming
 from pain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The men climbing down the ladder had remained stuck halfway down, trying
 to unholster their handguns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By that time, Andy and Ethan had come so close that they could clearly see
 the anxious fear on the men's faces.
 They had time enough to exchange a few more shots, the difference in adrenaline
 levels, training and experience making all the difference.
 The guards fell on the floor with a thump, one of them outright dead with
 a hole in his head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan urged Andy to climb first, and as he did so he took a look on his
 watch and his face turned ashen.
 He pushed Andy's buttocks upwards as he climbed, and felt an invigorating
 rush of heavy rain.
 Andy got outside and took a quick look around him, catching the glimpse
 of small teams of men spread around the mansion in disarray.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Ethan got outside right behind him he simply shouted:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run like all Hell's loose!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They started running in a southerly direction while they heard shots flying,
 unable to see how far off from the mark they were falling.
 The rain had already turned the dirt into mud, while the river up front
 seemed to froth out of control.
 They kept running while the bullets sometimes buried themselved in the
 mud or broke branches off a mangrove.
 Andy asked then with a shout:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Time?

It should? Fuck! If it hasn't then we have to-
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without ever having time to finish his sentence, Andy felt the earth beneath
 his feet tremble as if a terrible earthquake was underway.
 He slightly paused in his running stride as if he wanted to stop, turn
 around and look.
 Ethan caught a glimpse of him from the corner of his eye, and instinctively
 reached for his brother and brought him down along with him, flat on the
 ground.
 Then they felt a terrible wave of overpressure that washed over their bodies
 like a steamroller, pressing them into the mud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A horrible rumbling noise like a thunderclap tore up the air; a few moments
 later, they felt gravel and sand fall on top of them like a cloud had settled
 above them.
 Andy hesitantly turned around to look, and Ethan followed suit a moment
 later.
 Among the billowing dust cloud and the large fire, they could make out
 a crater at least three hundred feet wide.
 Another explosion was heard and they saw flames flickering wildly, and
 debris shooting up in the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

It's done,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Ethan as he got up and started walking with evident relief in his
 face, as if the thick rain cleansed everything.
 Andy got up, made the sign of the cross and followed him without ever turning
 to look back again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* * *
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The torrential rain had turned into a constant drizzle, an all-encompassing
 wet curtain.
 Andy had been leading their way to the extraction point - a few kilometers
 southwest - in an almost complete silence.
 Ethan knew it all had to do with Nicole, but he felt there was little he
 could say or do at that moment.
 It would take time; he had learned that the hard way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dense vegetation, the rain and their exhaustion as well as the wearing-out
 of the adrenaline meant they were taking their time.
 Still, when Ethan looked at his watch, they would be there on time: it
 was almost a quarter to one.
 Ethan then asked Andy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How close are we?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy stopped for a moment, said nothing and pointed to a clearing up ahead.
 They were walking down a small bluff, with the river on their right, overlookin
g the rest of the forest, a veritable sea of greens and browns, with a misty
 fog in place of a sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan was trying not to think about anything else other than a hot shower
 and a round or more of drinks.
 But he couldn't stop bringing up Nicole's image in his mind; her face all
 pale, and Andy's cries piercing his ears.
 He knew it was the only way, it was just that he also felt Andy might never
 see it that way.
 And that hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He kept his silent council and moved on.
 After a few minutes, they had arrived at the clearing with time to spare.
 Ethan sat down on the ground to rest his legs and feet, while Andy kept
 looking at the sky, as if searching for the helicopter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

He'll be here, alright.
 Don't worry about that.
 There's no one following us, at least not close enough.

 Ethan remained silent, unable to say anything of value.
 Andy went on after a few moments, his voice trembling, rising and falling

There are things, you need as a constant.

 They told us about it, how to handle it, how people fought it off during
 and after the war.
 But when you take that away from a man..
 When you find out what that single point of failure is, then..

His voice trailed off with a miserable echo of finality.
 Ethan was trying to find words, any words to make his brother feel that
 not everything was lost, that he was there to stand by him.
 But it felt pretentious and lacking.
 Ethan knew then he had gone through all this to find his brother, and now
 even though he was standing a couple of feet away, he was losing him anew.
 He couldn't allow that, so he told Andy:

Andy looked up at Ethan with a hint of tears welling up in his eyes.
 It was as if he was looking through a mirage at someone very familiar yet
 strange to him.
 He cleared his throat then and told Ethan:

 he said and lowered his head in contemplation once more.
 Ethan bit his lips and nodded silently.

Then he heard a pulsating, faint thumping noise that grew louder every moment.
 It was the sound of helicopter blades swooshing through the air; to Ethan,
 it sounded like trumpets from heaven.
 Despite all the guilt and the uneasiness he felt, it brought a thin smile
 to his lips.
 Andy took notice as a light troop transport helicopter appeared over the
 treetops through the thinning fog at a distance, criss-crossing the river
 as it kept a northernly route.

 said Ethan as he started flailing his hands wildly and jumping up and down.
 Andy stood up and had a better look.
 The helicopter swung towards them after a few seconds, circled up above
 and began a slow, careful descend right in the middle of the clearing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan could see James through the cockpit, smiling thinly.
 As the helicopter began touching down, both him and Andy crouched low and
 tried to shield their faces from the updraft created from the rotor blades
 that sent sand and mud flying towards them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The helicopter touched down with closed side-doors.
 Ethan noticed the engine pitch was going down as well; the rotor blades
 were spinning down.
 James had powered the helicopter down for some reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andy was looking at James warily, while Ethan shook his head to reassure
 him.
 He himself though, was feeling something was amiss.
 James opened the cockpit door and jumped off the helicopter.
 He was wearing the standard issue flight suit, complete with helmet which
 he promptly removed, and let the rain wash over his face.
 He blinked and tasted the rain for a moment, before he smiled at Ethan.

 James said and pointed the gun at Andy who had precious little time to
 remember that he had heard James' voice somewhere before.
 And then Andy was already lying on his back; the power of the shot had
 sent him flying a couple of feet, his shoulder a torn mess.
 His vision became blurry from the pain, the wound feeling hot like molten
 iron.
 Ethan instead of rushing towards James had remained stunned, unable to
 comprehend what had just happened.

 cried Ethan, as he tried to tend to his brother, rolling around the muddied
 ground, bleeding, and in pain.
 Ethan took out what few things remained from the medical kit, to at least
 stop the bleeding.
 James replied then with a deep, sombre voice:

 he said and took another clear shot at Andy.
 Andy's body stopped moving as it jerked once and then became limp.
 Ethan saw Andy with a frowned stare and an entry wound in his forehead.
 Pieces of skull and brain matter were lying on the mud near his slightly
 deformed head.
 His brother, was dead.
\end_layout

He felt he was going to go mad at that instant, blood rising up in his head

 he said, shaking his head slowly, cooly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan cried out in anguish and slumped himself besides his brother's body,
 unable to even stand upright.
 The upheaval of feeling was tremendous.
 Ethan felt everything all at once: infuriated and cheated, guilty and beaten
 down, ready to kill and simply waiting to die.
 He merely found the strength to ask with a crippled voice:

 chest.

Ethan stammered, barely able to find the words:

No.
 You're right, you're a smart man.
 It couldn't be just about a feeling now, could it? A simple, pure feeling?

 said James as he momentarily shrugged, the gun looking slightly away from
 Ethan.

\begin_layout Standard
And that was when Ethan sprang at him, swiveling his torso sideways.
 James' gun went off with a clamor, but Ethan was already pushing the gun
 away with one hand and aiming for his neck with the other.
 James' gaze went wild as he realised he had missed, but it curiously enough
 settled the next moment in a calm, peaceful stare; his carotis was shattered
 and he was drowning in his own blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
James fell face down in the mud, the colour of blood lost in the reddish
 brown mud.
 Ethan took a moment, sighed and looked at James body with a peculiar mix
 of disdain, surprise and sadness.
 He then took another look at his brother's body, and saw his vacant stare
 as rain kept falling on him.
 He sat down in the mud, and began to cry as if the rain that fell from
 above burned him.
 After a few more minutes, he came to grips and quietened down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He took a deep, long breath and looked at the bodies once more.
 He saw the helicopter idly sitting by, and started laughing and crying,
 without being able to control either feeling; he felt he had finally let
 go of himself.
 He didn't know how to fly; he suddenly realised he was still alive and
 couldn't stop laughing at the absurdness of it all.
