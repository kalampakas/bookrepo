\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a radical departure from the first book, for which writing a sequel seems
 untimely or perhaps even unwanted, I'm writing Blood Bonds (working title).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The story is set during the Biafran-Nigerian civil war, or Biafran war of
 independence (depending on whose side you're on or on your POV), and especially
 in 1968.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main protagonist, and what is later revealed to be a tragic figure is
 Ethan Whittmore, a captain of the Royal Marines and a British military
 advisor in Lagos, Nigeria.
 Ethan Whittmore has served in Kenya doing commando and paramilitary work
 of a dubious nature, having done things he is loathe to talk about and
 not especially proud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Lagos he has befriended his Nigerian Liaison, James Dwele, a Major (?)
 in the Nigerian Army.
 Dwele's brother had fought in the Kenyan liberation struggle only a few
 years earlier, and had died at the very hands of Ethan.
 It was not until after they had become friends that James learned of Ethan's
 involvement, background and history.
 After an internal struggle he decided to wait in order to exact his revenge
 and did so in a methodical, cold and calculating manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Ethan's brother, Doctor Andy (Stanley?) Whittmore goes into Biafra
 with a Red Cross relief mission, Ethan tries to warn his brother and discourage
 him because of the dangers involved with going into a civil war.
 Andy is adamant and waves away his brother's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a couple of months though, all contact between Ethan and Andy is lost.
 James runs some checks with Intelligence and informs Ethan that the red
 cross camp had been raided, most possibly by a local warlord, but there
 was not a single body of a caucasian to be found, suggesting that they
 either fleed deep into the jungle, unable to get to a town for help, or
 had been kept as prisoners to be ransomed at some point in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The essence of it was that Andy was somewhere in the Biafran jungle, most
 probably alive, but certainly in danger, if not already dead and buried
 somewhere in the jungle with no hope of ever finding a body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan is torn between duty and love for his younger brother, and after being
 urged by James, he decides to abandon his posting, go AWOL and search for
 his brother.
 In that undertaking, he counts on the help of James who will provide him
 with an extraction helicopter when and if Ethan locates Andy, as well as
 updates via radio of the movement and disposition of Nigerian and Biafran
 forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan contacts an acquaintance in MI6, Ian Ruthers, a war buddy from Kenya
 who owes him a favor or two, and arranges an identity as a journalist attached
 to a red cross caravan going into Biafra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once he sets out (not from Lagos but from a large red cross camp near the
 borders) and goes through the jungle, on the second day of their trek they
 stop for supplies and rest at a French Catholic monastery, run by a few
 nuns, some French, some local converts.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole Heurgot, a nurse who claims was part of a red
 cross caravan that was attacked, and her fleet brought her to the relative
 sanctuary and safety of the monastery.
 When Ethan introduces himself as who he really is tells her he is looking
 for his brother, she says to him that not only she knew Andy and they where
 on the same caravan, but that they were also lovers and she fears he might
 be dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In truth, Nicole is a french agent, working in league with Andy.
 After she happens upon Ethan, she notifies Andy via radio (the monastery
 also doubles as a cache and forward post for french intelligence operations
 in the area which involve providing equipment to the biafrans) about Ethan's
 search.
 Andy tells Nicole to wrangle his brother around, buy some time until he
 sends some personal effects from their jungle hideout to a nearby town,
 so that they can cook up a badly charred white caucasian body that could
 be Andy, and convince Ethan that Andy is dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the meantime, Ethan contacts James and finds out that he could not cover
 for him effectively, and trying to fake his leave of absence did not work
 out.
 He has been marked as AWOL and a court-martial and certain stripping of
 rank awaits him when he returns.
 As far as the Nigerians are concerned, they fear he has turned over to
 the Biafrans, and is considered an enemy of the state to be shot on sight.
 With his own government washing its hands off him and the Nigerians who
 he had been training considering him a traitor, Ethan has nowhere to go
 back to.
 His only purpose and reason now is to find his brother, dead or alive,
 and then try to vanish somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At that point the monastery is attacked by a local warlord, and Ethan single
 handedly kills a couple of them as well as the warlord, but even though
 the rest of the bandits flee, many of the red cross men and women have
 been killed, and the rest refuse to go on and simply try to make it back
 to Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Without a valid cover Ethan then asks for Nicole's help, which she seems
 to give willingly, out of concern for Andy.
 When Ethan explains that there's nothing left for him behind, and while
 already on their way to the closest town past the borders, she reveals
 to Ethan that she is actually a British agent working under cover in Biafra,
 and she is confident that her network of agents will be able to at least
 find out if Andy is alive, and even perhaps his whereabouts.
 Not only that, but she is confident she can smuggle Ethan out of the country
 and perhaps clear his name, so that Ethan has one more reason to stick
 with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they arrive at the bordertown, they settle for the night in a shanty
 hotel.
 When Ethan wakes up, he finds out that Nicole has gone and has left him
 a note with some contacts whom he must talk with, and arranges a meeting
 in a safehouse, because of pressing business.
 In truth, Nicole left to arrange the duping of the body and the various
 contacts that are supposed to feed Ethan with false information, have him
 go around in circles only to have him find out his brother is dead in the
 morgue (a fake body).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While Nicole is away, Ethan in the back of his head is always alert and
 distrustful especially now that he believes the only man he can trust is
 James, and the only man who might actually have an escape route available.
 He contacts his MI6 man in dire need, asking to know whether or not there
 is a woman like Nicole working for the british in biafra.
 Though reluctantly, his buddy Ian tells him he'll have to do a search.
 He arranges it so that he passes a 'yes' or 'no' message via the BBC, the
 next night (perhaps a specific song, or a glitch in the clock beeps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The contact spot is a bar, where Ethan receives the message from BBC radio
 that Nicole is not who she claims she is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole, gives him the bad news that Andy is dead, his body in the morgue,
 charred and almost unrecognizable but for his dental fillings, harmonica
 and switchblade with his initials and Eton insignia (or whatnot).
 Ethan is convinced he is being lied to because his brother had a slightly
 smaller hip (or whatnot) that seemed okay in this body.
 Ethan does not openly express himself, but seems withdrawn and in mourning,
 while heavily contemplating his next move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole weeps convincingly enough, and says to Ethan that tomorrow morning
 she'll arrange passage for Ethan first to (african state bordering south
 nigeria) and then on to South Africa where he might have a better luck
 clearing his name with the army.
 For that night, they'll sleep together in the safehouse with the local
 biafran man that acts as her bodyguard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan times his attack well and catches the man off-guard.
 In the fight that ensues, the man is killed and Nicole gets away.
 Rummaging through the man's belongings he finds a few clues (key, receipts
 etc.) that lead him to expose Nicole's network as what it really is, a french
 network of agents.
 ONe of them also coughs up the location of the jungle HQ/hideout, where
 Ethan decides to go next, believing that he had been sidetracked on purpose,
 and a fake body of Andy was indeed proof that he was alive and certainly
 their prisoner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When he arrives at the site he finds out a red cross deserted camp, similar
 to what his brother's camp should have been.
 Trying to search for more clues, he is attacked suddenly and rendered unconscio
us, by his own brother Andy.
 When he wakes up he is restrained and Andy and Nicole are there , trying
 to explain to him that Andy is working for the French, and that they are
 a couple now, intent on getting married officially once their work in Biafra
 is done.
 Not only that, but Andy explains how he had grown disenchanted with the
 British imperialistic way of doing things, and that he genuinely believes
 he is helping Biafrans in their fight for independence and justice.
 Ethan says bollocks to all that, spits on his brother and can't believe
 he actually sold everything off to save a traitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They leave things at that and Andy tells his brother that he hopes he comes
 around soon or else there will be no place for him there and he would have
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In reality, Andy is a double agent working for MI6 (unbeknownst to Ian who
 could not have known that -- only handlers know such info), having infiltrated
 the French agency, supplying the british with detailed information about
 the plans and operations of the French, and waiting for the opportune time
 to bring all the french operations in Biafra to an end, effectively leaving
 the Biafrans without any outside help, and bringing the war one step closer
 to the end with the Nigerians and their friends the British on the winning
 end, awarding the oil contracts to the british.
 He arranges it so that Ethan can get out of his bonds and gives him a chance
 to escape unharmed and without alerting someone.
 That way he hopes that his brother will finally get away from his own affairs
 without jeopardising or hampering his mission, and with an added bonus,
 the french operations will be disrupted while they relocate their base
 of operations.
 The problem arises when Ethan does not think of it that way, and instead
 takes it upon himself to kill Nicole and as many French agents and collaborator
s as he can.
 When he kills Nicole, Andy is outraged: Ethan had terminated the efforts
 and work of many months with one stroke, at the wrong time.
 Andy tells him who he really is and Ethan is stunned, unable to believe.
 When he is told details and truths and shown his radio signals, Ethan finally
 believes his brother (with some good old look-me-in-the-eye fashion), and
 offers their route of escape, James.
 While they set some explosives to go off, at least maximizing the damage
 and then going off to the LZ, they are discovered and a small hunt begins,
 trying to save their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they finally reach the LZ and wait for the chopper to salvation, exchanging
 fire from a long distance, James is seen in the pilot's seat alone.
 When he touches down the chopper and the two brothers run towards it, he
 opens up the door and puts a bullet squarely through Andy's head.
 Ethan is stunned, and while James is pointing the gun at him, between tears
 and babbling, confused and overwhelmed by contrasting emotions, James retells
 Ethan how he has exacted his revenge by killing Ethan's brother, just like
 Ethan had killed his own a few years ago.
 Ethan gets into a fight with James and finally kills him.
 He is left alone in a jungle clearing with the chopper still whirring its
 blades slowly and the French still after him, his brother and his best
 friend dead beside him.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a training with Marines from the 3rd Marine Division, Ethan Whittmore
 is told by his friend James Dwele that he has had some news about his brother.
 Ethan had lost contact with his brother and had asked James to find out
 what he could, as he is the intelligence officer of the division Ethan
 is attached to as a military advisor.
 James and Ethan discuss what can be done about Andy, and Ethan proposes
 that he should go in search of his brother, bringing the example of James'
 brother who had died in Kenya and James himself was unable to help.
 Some of Ethan's exploits are discussed but he seems reluctant to talk about
 these, while James in effect traps Ethan into finding Andy so he can exact
 his revenge.
 James promises he will try and keep in touch with Ethan and they arrange
 codes and radio frequencies.
 James also says he will try to cover for Ethan but thinks that he will
 not be able to buy enought time.
 Ethan believes he can arrange a cover, and does so via a friend in the
 MI6, Ian Ruthers.
 By the end of the chapter, James and Ethan shake hands and Ethan starts
 off with the caravan, a few range rovers, local volunteers and red cross
 personnel from various countries, while his cover is Richard Owls, a journalist
 for the London Times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Well met on an ill road
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The next couple of days pass rather languidly, the backdrop of the civil
 war and the jungle scenery featuring prominently until the caravan stops
 at a catholic monastery for supply and rest, as well as local info that
 should help them to avoid fighting and reach their intended destination
 (some local town) with relative safety.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole, and he finds out some direct info about his
 brother, believing at first that Nicole is indeed a nurse who had a relationshi
p with his brother.
 By the end of the chapter, Nicole is seen contacting Andy discussing a
 course of action, revealing her identity as an French agent to the reader,
 as well as seeing that the monastery is a cache/hideout for the French
 and an exchange point for Biafrans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Right before setting out the next day, at dawn, the monastery is attacked
 by a local warlord and his group of bandits (just because he had found
 out that Biafrans are supplied from such a place and equipment and ammo
 can be found there).
 The red cross caravan is cut down by fire, while Ethan puts his skills
 to use, and after most of the personnel is dead, and while the bandits
 begin their search for the cache, Ethan cuts the throat of the warlord,
 arms himself with an assault rifle and through hiding and shooting, takes
 down more than a couple of bandits, the rest of which decide things are
 already going badly for them, and flee into the jungle.
 After the firefight, Ethan helps with the bodies after which the nuns that
 are left alive pack their few belongings and decide to leave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Heed no prayer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The caravan is now non-existent and the few survivors terrified rush back
 to Nigeria.
 Ethan has no cover now, and while thinking ways of reaching Biafra through
 the jungle, Nicole acts according to plan, which is to safely remove Ethan
 from the picture.
 Knowing his brother would go after him no matter what, Andy had arranged
 for Nicole to set up the fake body, and while they would do that, wank
 him around a border town searching for clues that lead nowhere except the
 fake dead body of Andy, the idea being that Ethan would have thought his
 brother dead.
 Nicole then in order to perform that plan tells him that she is in fact
 a british agent (and perhaps that the cache that Ethan saw etc.
 was an english cache), and that her network of agents can help Ethan with
 hisn quest, so they set out together, to arrive the next couple of days
 to the small bordertown of LALA.
 During the trip through the jungle they witness the horrors of civil war,
 and while Nicole takes a humanist approach to the subject, she is seen
 knowing a lot about the politics involved in the matter (the oil fields
 etc.).
 Ethan seems focused on finding his brother and comes across as somewhat
 cynical and distant concerninc war and its atrocities.
 By the end of the chapter, they arrive at the small town, and sleep.
 When Ethan wakes up he finds the note with the contacts and a rendezvous
 point.
 He then thinks about what he had discussed with Nicole earlier and believes
 there's something awry with her (though she has detailed knowledge of Andy,
 she puts him off), and decides to phone Ian once more.
 Ian is disturbed by what Ethan tells him has happened, and promises to
 find out or whether or not there's an agent like Nicole in the area.
 Because he will be unable to safely deliver the message otherwise, he'll
 arrange something through the BBC (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 - something from their wartime past probably - a yes or no).

 Dead men can't dance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(this is the part where Ethan learns he is now considered AWOL, a turncoat
 for the biafrans etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole's contacts are pretty worthless, feeding Ethan disinformation, and
 making him go around in circles, finding out nothing new about his brother.
 By the time the rendezvous with Nicole comes up, it's 9 o'clock and it
 is now revealed to Ethan that Nicole is not who she claims to be.
 He keeps his cools and believes he is being lied to on purpose so that
 he cannot find his brother.
 When Nicole informs him his brother is in the morgue on LARGER_TOWN he
 believes there's something very rotten going on.
 He decides to hop along Nicole and some local who is both muscle and local
 expert, part of the supposed network.
 They go to the morgue and Ethan is shown the charred remains of an unidentified
 caucasian the same height and apparent bodyweight as his brother, with
 the correct fillings and some personal effects like his switchblade, pocket
 watch etc.
 Ethan for a few moments believes he might have erred, but then notices
 his brother's leg is not a bit shorter than the other, a birth defect that
 was almost imperceptible.
 He then notices an exposed collarbone that seemed perfectly shaped while
 his brother had cracked it at a small age, and it should have been noticeable.
 Thus Ethan now has proof that Nicole is indeed someone else and actively
 trying to divert him away from Andy.
 In tears she proposes that Ethan has nothing to do other than bury his
 brother tomorrow, and go home while there's still time to clear his name,
 something she promises she'll help with.
 Ethan plays along and they leave for a house that belonged to the local
 man (Adu Nebdele), and served as a place where they could use for operating
 (truthfully, as their french base of operations in LARGER_TOWN).
 At night, Ethan pretends to be sleeping and while prowling around the house,
 Adu catches him having found the radio creche and while at first he Acts
 as if nothing's wrong, when Ethan notices signals decoded/to be sent in
 french and british movement and nigerian charts, a fight ensues and Nicole
 wakes up.
 Ethan swiftly kills Adu and Nicole escapes him.
 He decides to take action and starts to round up the so-called network,
 while Nicole flees to contact Andy in person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Blood thin as water
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan starts to terrorize the various contacts he had met before.
 Some yield the small value of info that they had been instructed to mislead
 him, some run before he can catch them, some die while trying to kill him
 and one of them is tortured and confesses the location of the french hideout
 in the jungle.
 Ethan travels to the location on foot only to find out it is an abandoned
 (the abandoned most possibly) red cross camp of his brother.
 While searching he finds out that the camp was a decoy and that there was
 a hidden underground entrance near a waterfall.
 Right before he tries to enter the complex, he is struck unconscious by
 his brother, and dragged inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
7.
 When Ethan wakes up, he is restrained to a chair, noticing the knots can
 be loosened over a few hours.
 He is not hurt, and his brother Andy and Nicole are trying to explain that
 they had simply tried to avoid him finding out Andy is an agent for the
 French, working in Biafra in order to help the biafrans achieve independence,
 and promote French interests in the oil industry.
 He and Nicole try to convince to work for them as well, and provide detailed
 info and feedback on British-Nigerian practices and plans, as well as train
 Biafrans to have an advantage over the Nigerians.
 Ethan refuses vehemently, Nicole is frustrated, and Andy leaves Ethan to
 think it over.
 In fact, Andy has arranged the knots to be easy to loose and a ready escape
 route for Ethan so he can get out of there alive and noe be part of the
 picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Instead Ethan decides to go after them both, and going into commando mode,
 kills Nicole while at the same time Andy sees him do it.
 By the end of the chapter, Andy is seen pointing a gun at Ethan calling
 him an idiot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
8.
 Andy explains to ethan that he is a double agent working for the British,
 feeding disinformation to the French, and trying to find the opportune
 time to blow up their whole operations in Biafra.
 Ethan is hard to believe it but in the end believes his brother and the
 proof he shows him.
 Now that everything has gone tits up, Ethan says he can still save them,
 and arrange an extraction via James.
 While he does so, their cover is blown and they start running for their
 lives, while the ETA is about an hour.
 In the ensuing firefights around the camp, some if it is blown off and
 then they start the run inside the jungle to the LZ.
 When the chopper finally arrives, the french are hot in their heels.
 James touches down, shoots Andy, tells Ethan the truth about him and his
 brother, Ethan kills him and is left with the chopper and the French behind
 him.

\begin_layout Chapter
In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sweat ran freely down the red-haired Englishman's temples, smearing the
 jungle camo on his clean-shaven face.
 A knife blade covered in dry mud sat in his left hand, while his other
 hand made a rough circle in the air.
 It was a hand signal for the command to encircle the target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five men melted away into the green humid jungle in a heartbeat, as if they
 had been an optical illusion.
 They moved fast; faster than what Ethan had believed them capable of.
 He decided to stand back for a little while more, and see how they could
 handle their approach on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of them stopped dead in their tracks and hunched low when they heard
 noise, probably from the direction of the clearing up ahead.
 The two men that formed the edge of the squad aimed their rifles outwards
 from the squad, as if a switch had been thrown.
 The point man laid himself flat with the silken grace of a cat, knife drawn
 in his right hand while his left hand reached out for his Colt zero-point-forty
-five.
 The rearguard moved like a pair of dancers, covering each other's back,
 both aiming their rifles from shoulder-high, safeties clicked off to single-sho
t selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that cautious small diamond formation they moved as a whole, each step
 forward made with practiced ease and well-earned confidence, the mark of
 a well-trained soldier.
 For all intends and purposes, and as far as Ethan was concerned, he had
 done a good job training them.
 What did bother him though was that they had yet to fire a shot in anger.
 He knew that nothing tests a man like real combat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though they moved precisely as they had been taught, and seemed quick and
 stealthy enough, Ethan couldn't really tell if they just went through the
 motions or if they were really up for the challenge.
 After all, no matter how much one practices before a show, it's the opening
 night that makes or breaks it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan's free hand was wrapped tightly around a metal L-shaped trigger attached
 to a small box no larger than a pack of cigarettes, from which a run of
 cables protruded and got lost somewhere under the rich jungle tapestrie
 of green and brown.
 With a tight grin, Ethan whispered to himself with the expectation of a
 job well done:
\end_layout

Showtime, lads.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he double-clicked the trigger the first thing that attracted everyone's
 attention were the flashes.
 And then came the shockwaves, their force pummeling at everyone, making
 every ribcage vibrate intensely as if tremors had seized them.
 And that was just the opening note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small gun fire erupted from various well-placed locations, the muzzle flashes
 dotting the lavish scenery as if hundreds of photographers clicked in rapid
 succession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scouts instantly dived for cover, falling prone while keeping their
 arcs of fire fimly fixed to their own particular zone of responsibility.
 A wry smile formed on Ethan's face: he seemed to be enjoying the performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five trainees were on their bellies, rolling and crawling over the jungle
 bed in an effort to find as much cover as possible in mere moments.
 They exchanged quick glances and made repetitive hand motions to each other,
 communicating silently trying to establish a point where they could fall
 back away from the guns blazing at them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every tree trunk and low bush or gully counted for gold at times like these,
 and the five Marine scouts from the 3rd Marine division made excellent
 use of their surroundings.
 Very much so that Ethan felt a twang of pride at seeing his handiwork in
 action.
 They were his men, and they seemed every bit as professional as he intended
 them to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They quickly abandoned their exposed position for a slightly shallow depression
 with good cover, fat tree trunks strewn around them with thick bush for
 cover and a clear view on all sides.
 A defendable position from which they could easily spot a move against
 them and fall back while they harassed their enemy firing and moving in
 turns.
 Ethan's mind flashed with the sudden realisation they were good enough
 to be Royal Marine scouts, not just Nigerian troops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He almost felt a hint of regret he couldn't be there with them when it really
 mattered, when the guns pointing towards them were not loaded with blanks;
 when the explosive charges half a mile away were real shells and mortars
 falling right on them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost, as Ethan reminded himself inside his head, was the eminent keyword:
 This was not his war, not by a far chance, and setting up mock engagements
 such as this one was as close as he wanted to get to another warzone.
 Except for the times when he itched, except for the times he woke up in
 the middle of the night drenched in sweat, knowing it wasn't the tropical
 heat that left him sleepless thereafter, but faces all too well remembered
 and defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team of five men had dug themselves in taking solid cover.
 The gunfire died down soon afterwards, and Ethan believed there was no
 point in continuing tracking and crossing the jungle.
 He had seen what he wanted to see, and that was a team of scouts, not a
 bunch of gung-ho Nigerians hollering with rifles raised firing on auto,
 vying for Igbo blood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan raised himself above the brushes and bellowed as if he wanted the
 cadets back at Sandhurst to hear him clear as rain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team of five gave no sign of sight or sound that they had heard their
 instructor.
 Ethan repeated himself with less enthusiasm:

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Come on, games' over! Let's head back for some rest, off we go.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, nothing could be now heard other than the usual sounds of the jungle,
 the distant cries of birds and monkeys, and the constant buzzing of mosquitoes
 and other assorted exotic insects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan furrowed his brow and briefly considered that the team might have
 actually extracted themselves without him noticing, and decided to check
 the small depression himself.
 With a hurried pace, he made his way through the brush and in a few moments
 reached the position he had last seen them take cover in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw noone, but suddenly felt a piece of metal poking him through his
 left side, right between his ribs, poised to pierce his heart at a single
 thrust.
 He had been caught unawares, and once he looked sideways to his assailant,
 he saw Onko, the team scout leader smiling wildly, his bright white teeth
 a stark contrast to his camouflaged dark face.
 A little stunned and a little bit surprised, Ethan barely had time to let
 off a curse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bugger me, you've grown into a real scout Onko.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which the nigerian marine responded with a heavy accent, no longer wearing
 the same disarming smile:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Onko then sheathed the knife once more, and the four other men suddenly
 appeared from quite unlikely and widespread places, from any one of which
 they could have put a bullet through Ethan at their leisure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan nodded and made a small sigh, as if acknowledging he had indeed let
 his guard down and been overcome, exactly what he tought his recruits should
 never happen, not even while not in the battlefield.
 Cultivating a little paranoia went a long way in keeping a man alive, especiall
y in a civil war where telling a friend from an enemy was not as clean a
 business as shooting at one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan did manage to save some face though when he pointed at his feet to
 a small bump in the ground, leaves cluttered all over it and said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See now Dbele, that's a mark for a landmine.
 You might have killed at least one man when you fell back here.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Onko was far from smiling at that information, and with a mixed expression
 somewhere between anger and disappointment he said to Ethan, making it
 sound almost like an accusation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There was no place else to fall back and cover, Captain.
 It was a death trap then, for sure.
 What could we have done different? That's not fair, sir.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word `sir' had a strange ring to it, and that probably was because it
 was meant to sound off-putting.
 Ethan only cared to answer briefly right before he turned about and started
 walking to the gathering area of the training field:

Ethan searched his pockets for the occasional dime and twenty, but to no
 avail.
 He rarely needed small change when he made his cosmopolitan visits to the
 center of Lagos, but using the jukebox in Loui's bar was such an occasion,
 and even more so a favourite habit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, Ethan was not a rare visitor to Loui's establishment, and most
 would instantly recognise him, widely known as the Englishman, both to
 the few locals and the numerous extraordinary foreigners that frequented
 the Metropolitaine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan maintained that he came for the jukebox, whilst his tab indicated
 a thirsty sort of music lover with a certain taste for fine malts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Malts such as the unusually fine scotch that Loui kept stashed for the well-off
 or even well-liked customer, a distinction about which Ethan never did
 determine his own standing.
 He had simply decided to thank God there was good scotch to be found in
 a place like Nigeria and even more so in a bar like Loui's.
 To make the realisation even more mind-numbing for Ethan, there was good
 scotch to be found during a civil war; a state of affairs that was mirrored
 in the Metropolitaine's haute decoration, or more appropriately its blatant
 lack thereof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sunlight crept feebly through the smoke and dirt stained windows; immitation
 leather couches stank of alcohol and vomit, while most of the metal tables
 and chairs were full of patches of peeled off paint, reminiscent of the
 dead ships rotting away down at the bay.
 A couple of ceiling fans still worked despite what one might expect at
 first sight, and that only because the air would have become totally unbreathab
le if the fans ever stopped working.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What the Metropolitaine lacked in all its other aspects, it made up for
 in its proprietor, maitre d' and barman, Louis N'kwama, whose cordial manners,
 eagerness to serve and professional discretion was the reason why the place
 was still running at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was with his usual wide grin that Louis approached Ethan and offered
 him a penny, before bowing slightly, impeccably dressed in a striped jacket,
 white pressed shirt, bowtie and smart pants, completely out of place not
 just in his own bar but in Nigeria as well.
 Ethan accepted the coin gladly and immediately dropped it in the slot,
 while Louis chimed in his blatantly french but not quite so accent:

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan smiled wryly and nodded while selecting a song in the jukebox, his
 index finger searching for the correct button to press.
 When he finally selected `Under my thumb', he turned to reply to Louis
 before setting off to settle in his usual barstool:

 the bar.
 When he next spoke, it was with a feeling of relief:

 one of his finest malts from a cupboard below and a short glass, and said

 He made a slight motion with his indicating the cupboard below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Louis narrowed his gaze on Ethan, and while he went through the motions
 of pouring another glass of scotch, he asked his regular customer for the
 past year or so with his usual air of cool affection:

Loui reached for a tall cupboard with a lock on the handles, and used a

sat, dusty and squat, and seemingly quite authentic.
 At the sight of the bottles of scotch and the prospect of savouring them

 His voice couldn't contain his enthusiasm:

Ethan blinked twice and was taken slightly aback when the name of the greatest

 His accent suddenly became a bit heavier, rolling the l's:

Loui pointed with his long bony index finger to a sturdy, tall and fit black

The soldier's gaze quickly settled on Ethan though, who spinning around
 on his barstool to look at the newcomer directly, cracked a smile and gave
 a mocking half-salute to the burly man who also appeared to be a brevet
 Major.
 The man did not seem to share the same good humor and did not salute, neither
 did he seem to enjoy smiles and levity a lot.
 As he approached the bar, Ethan cheerfully made a gesture at the still
 open cupboard full of Cullough and greeted the man with a proposition:

 So, what is the unhappy occassion of your visit here in uniform? Tell me

\begin_layout Standard
The Metropolitaine was in full swing.
 A small gang of sailors were celebrating one of their mates birthday, following
 the customary rule of drinking till the botswain comes looking for them.
 Loui kept a wary eye on a couple of strange figures, but other than that
 the orders kept coming in and that made him a happy man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethan on the other hand looked far from jovial.
 Indeed, news of losing contact with his brother had suddenly turned this
 war into a personal matter, something that every professional soldier tried
 to avoid.
 Making warfare personal made it a matter of sentiment, and that usually
 threw logic and reason out the window.
 It also meant someone would do something stupid, and stupidity was a well-known
 but also much overlooked factor in dying.

\begin_layout Standard
James had fallen silent for a couple minutes, silently sipping at his wine,
 a local unbottled variety without a fancy name and year or an extravagant
 price.
 Ethan was down to his last couple of cigarettes, chain-smoking ever since
 they sat down to talk.
 At length, Ethan broke the uncomfortable silence:

I should have pulled some strings when he told me he was going in with the
 Red Cross.
 Red tape, paperwork, passport trouble.
 Surely someone you know in the Interior could have been of some help.

James motioned a definite `no' with his head, eyes closed shut.
 He then had another sip before answering:

Do you honestly believe someone would be bothered with that? Not to mention
 that holding up a Red Cross caravan would be a publicity headache.
 Surely, the war in Nigeria is not as popular, or should I say as infamous,
 but people watch and criticise.
 We are trying to secure help and end this swiftly.
 That's one of the reasons you're here Ethan.
 What would the London times write? It's bad politics, Ethan.
 No need to add more to our bag of troubles.

Ethan drew heavily on his cigarette and exhaled briskly, his slight irritation
 evident in his suddenly louder voice.
 He was now talking faster when he said:

Bag of troubles? You've barely become a state and it's all coming loose
 at the seams.
 There's probably hundreds if not thousands of people who come and go across
 your so-called borders as they please, people for which you haven't got
 the slightest idea, and you're trying to tell me that denying entry to
 one man in a Red Cross caravan would lose the war for you? I've heard shitty
 reasons before, but this outdoes even the shit of a rhino! I didn't even
 try James, and you're telling me you can't stop a man from entering?

James was as calm as before, answering with a flat and emotionless voice,
 trying to calm down Ethan as well:

Not with a Red Cross caravan.
 They would have made official claims, told their story to the press, the
 press would tell the world Nigeria is performing a genocide, stampeding
 all over the Geneva convention and so on.
 They would have made us look like child killers.
 And you now our support in your parliament is thin, to say the least.
 No, we could not have told your brother to just go home.
 It was your job to do so if you wanted.
 Not mine, and certainly not Nigeria's.

Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one go and motioned
 his empty glass to Loui who seemed to notice almost immediately.
 Ethan then looked straight into James' eyes, dark eyes which were accented
 by the small bit of white that surrounded them.
 He tried to calm himself and find the right words:
\end_layout

You are right about that.
 It was my job.
 I should have just whipped him good like when we were still ten years old.
 But he's a grown man, a doctor.
 He has his duties, his obligations.
 Like I have mine.
 Though I still think it's stupid, at least he acted like the man he's supposed
 to be.
 He wanted to help, he signed up with the Red Cross.

There was a pause.
 Loui was returning to their table with Ethan's refill of Cullough, and
 a clean ashtray.
 Ethan took his time before continuing, and nodded his thanks to Loui who
 bowed slightly and fleeted off to serve some other corner in the Metropolitaine.
 James had rested his arms on the table, his frame and build too large to
 sit comfortably almost anywhere.
 Ethan took a mouthful of Cullough and flinched when he felt it burn down
 through his throat and into his stomach.
 He then went on:

It's not just his job, it's his service to the world, treating the sick
 and the wounded.
 I know war's no place for idealists and romantics.
 I've seen it real up close and personal and I'd like none of that come
 knocking at my door.
 Maybe I even think Stanley's doing a better job than I ever could.
 Can't really tell why I didn't stop him.
 I just couldn't, you know? Dammit, why couldn't he just stay at home and
 sent food and medicine packages?

 one of the last cigarettes in his pack.

James expression seemed to change somewhat.
 He removed his hands from the table and for a moment sat still, looking
 at Ethan intensely.
 He then ordered another drink from Loui, who seemingly kept a watchful
 eye at their table more so than other tables and nodded promptly, going
 at the back for a couple minutes.
 When James spoke next, he was lighting up Ethan's last cigarette, receiving
 nothing but the stunned surprise and deep furrow of Ethan:

James drew on his cigarette and threw his head back to let off the smoke.
 He was smiling when he pointed to Ethan and said:

 He sipped another mouthful from his glass of scotch which was disappearing

Ethan smiled while trying to down the last mouthful of Cullogh from his
 glass, and pointed to his mouth.
 When he did swallow it, his face contorted from the intense feeling of
 a wet fireball going down to his belly, but managed to respond timely:

Kenya, right.
 Nineteen sixty three.
 The yankees had just invaded Vietnam and my team had shipped out to Kenya
 as part of an operation to stall the guerillas, turn them on each other,
 make contact with loyalists, stop the insurrection in its infancy.
 It was pretty complex, and too damn ambitious with so few men.
 No small wonder it failed.
 And it wasn't because of that we lost Kenya.
 Anyway, that part of the story's known.

Ethan stopped for a moment when Loui came with James' new glass of wine.
 He picked up Ethan's empty glass and nodded with a wink, before leaving
 them alone once again.
 Somewhere in the opposite corner of the Metropolitaine a loud crashing
 noise was heard and Ethans fleeting gaze revealed the bunch of sailors
 strewn around over lots of broken glasses and a couple of upturned tables.
 A loud chorus of laughters was heard and once the noise resumed its regularly
 high levels, Ethan decided to go on:
