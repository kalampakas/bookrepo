<a class="toc" name="toc-Chapter-1"></a>In her Majesty’s service
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Sweat ran freely down the red-haired Englishman’s temples, smearing the jungle camo on his clean-shaven face. A knife blade covered in dry mud sat in his left hand, while his other hand made a rough circle in the air. It was a hand signal for the command to encircle the target.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Five men melted away into the green humid jungle in a heartbeat, as if they had been an optical illusion. They moved fast; faster than what Ethan had believed them capable of. He decided to stand back for a little while more, and see how they could handle their approach on their own.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
All of them stopped dead in their tracks and hunched low when they heard noise, probably from the direction of the clearing up ahead. The two men that formed the edge of the squad aimed their rifles outwards from the squad, as if a switch had been thrown. The point man laid himself flat with the silken grace of a cat, knife drawn in his right hand while his left hand reached out for his Colt zero-point-forty-five. The rearguard moved like a pair of dancers, covering each other’s back, both aiming their rifles from shoulder-high, safeties clicked off to single-shot selection.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In that cautious small diamond formation they moved as a whole, each step forward made with practiced ease and well-earned confidence, the mark of a well-trained soldier. For all intends and purposes, and as far as Ethan was concerned, he had done a good job training them. What did bother him though was that they had yet to fire a shot in anger. He knew that nothing tests a man like real combat.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Though they moved precisely as they had been taught, and seemed quick and stealthy enough, Ethan couldn’t really tell if they just went through the motions or if they were really up for the challenge. After all, no matter how much one practices before a show, it’s the opening night that makes or breaks it.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan’s free hand was wrapped tightly around a metal L-shaped trigger attached to a small box no larger than a pack of cigarettes, from which a run of cables protruded and got lost somewhere under the rich jungle tapestrie of green and brown. With a tight grin, Ethan whispered to himself with the expectation of a job well done:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Showtime, lads.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When he double-clicked the trigger the first thing that attracted everyone’s attention were the flashes. And then came the shockwaves, their force pummeling at everyone, making every ribcage vibrate intensely as if tremors had seized them. And that was just the opening note.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Small gun fire erupted from various well-placed locations, the muzzle flashes dotting the lavish scenery as if hundreds of photographers clicked in rapid succession.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The scouts instantly dived for cover, falling prone while keeping their arcs of fire fimly fixed to their own particular zone of responsibility. A wry smile formed on Ethan’s face: he seemed to be enjoying the performance.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The five trainees were on their bellies, rolling and crawling over the jungle bed in an effort to find as much cover as possible in mere moments. They exchanged quick glances and made repetitive hand motions to each other, communicating silently trying to establish a point where they could fall back away from the guns blazing at them.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Every tree trunk and low bush or gully counted for gold at times like these, and the five Marine scouts from the 3rd Marine division made excellent use of their surroundings. Very much so that Ethan felt a twang of pride at seeing his handiwork in action. They were his men, and they seemed every bit as professional as he intended them to be.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
They quickly abandoned their exposed position for a slightly shallow depression with good cover, fat tree trunks strewn around them with thick bush for cover and a clear view on all sides. A defendable position from which they could easily spot a move against them and fall back while they harassed their enemy firing and moving in turns. Ethan’s mind flashed with the sudden realisation they were good enough to be Royal Marine scouts, not just Nigerian troops.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
He almost felt a hint of regret he couldn’t be there with them when it really mattered, when the guns pointing towards them were not loaded with blanks; when the explosive charges half a mile away were real shells and mortars falling right on them. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Almost, as Ethan reminded himself inside his head, was the eminent keyword: This was not his war, not by a far chance, and setting up mock engagements such as this one was as close as he wanted to get to another warzone. Except for the times when he itched, except for the times he woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, knowing it wasn’t the tropical heat that left him sleepless thereafter, but faces all too well remembered and defined.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The team of five men had dug themselves in taking solid cover. The gunfire died down soon afterwards, and Ethan believed there was no point in continuing tracking and crossing the jungle. He had seen what he wanted to see, and that was a team of scouts, not a bunch of gung-ho Nigerians hollering with rifles raised firing on auto, vying for Igbo blood.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan raised himself above the brushes and bellowed as if he wanted the cadets back at Sandhurst to hear him clear as rain:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;End of session! Fine job!&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The team of five gave no sign of sight or sound that they had heard their instructor. Ethan repeated himself with less enthusiasm:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Come on, games’ over! Let’s head back for some rest, off we go.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Still, nothing could be now heard other than the usual sounds of the jungle, the distant cries of birds and monkeys, and the constant buzzing of mosquitoes and other assorted exotic insects.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan furrowed his brow and briefly considered that the team might have actually extracted themselves without him noticing, and decided to check the small depression himself. With a hurried pace, he made his way through the brush and in a few moments reached the position he had last seen them take cover in.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
He saw noone, but suddenly felt a piece of metal poking him through his left side, right between his ribs, poised to pierce his heart at a single thrust. He had been caught unawares, and once he looked sideways to his assailant, he saw Onko, the team scout leader smiling wildly, his bright white teeth a stark contrast to his camouflaged dark face. A little stunned and a little bit surprised, Ethan barely had time to let off a curse:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Bugger me, you’ve grown into a real scout Onko.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To which the nigerian marine responded with a heavy accent, no longer wearing the same disarming smile:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You grow soft, Captain Whittmore.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Onko then sheathed the knife once more, and the four other men suddenly appeared from quite unlikely and widespread places, from any one of which they could have put a bullet through Ethan at their leisure.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan nodded and made a small sigh, as if acknowledging he had indeed let his guard down and been overcome, exactly what he tought his recruits should never happen, not even while not in the battlefield. Cultivating a little paranoia went a long way in keeping a man alive, especially in a civil war where telling a friend from an enemy was not as clean a business as shooting at one.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan did manage to save some face though when he pointed at his feet to a small bump in the ground, leaves cluttered all over it and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;See now Dbele, that’s a mark for a landmine. You might have killed at least one man when you fell back here.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Onko was far from smiling at that information, and with a mixed expression somewhere between anger and disappointment he said to Ethan, making it sound almost like an accusation:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;There was no place else to fall back and cover, Captain. It was a death trap then, for sure. What could we have done different? That’s not fair, sir.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The word ‘sir’ had a strange ring to it, and that probably was because it was meant to sound off-putting. Ethan only cared to answer briefly right before he turned about and started walking to the gathering area of the training field:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Who said anything about war being fair, sergeant?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="center">

</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the warm light of neon orange, Ethan searched his pockets for the some small change, but to no avail. He rarely needed dimes and pennies when he made his cosmopolitan visits to the center of Lagos, but using the jukebox in Loui’s bar was such an occasion, and even more so a favourite habit.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In fact, Ethan was not a rare visitor to Loui’s establishment, and most would instantly recognise him. He was widely known as the Englishman, both to the few locals and the numerous extraordinary foreigners that frequented the Metropolitaine.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan maintained that he only came for the regularly up-to-date jukebox, whilst his tab indicated a thirsty sort of music lover with a certain taste for fine malts.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Malts such as the unusually fine scotch that Loui kept stashed for the well-off or even well-liked customer. He had simply decided to thank God there was good scotch to be found in a place like Nigeria and even more so in a bar like Loui’s. To make the realisation even more mind-numbing for Ethan, there was good scotch to be found during a civil war; a state of affairs that was mirrored in the Metropolitaine’s crude and shanty decoration, or more appropriately its blatant lack thereof.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A couple of ceiling fans still worked despite what one might expect at first sight, barely keeping the air from going stale.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It was with his usual wide grin that Louis, the proprietor, approached Ethan and offered him a penny before bowing slightly, impeccably dressed in a striped jacket, white pressed shirt, bowtie and smart pants, an air of the thirties Paris about him. Ethan accepted the coin gladly and immediately dropped it in the slot, while Louis chimed in his blatantly french but not unbearable accent:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Compliments of the house, Capitain. The usual? Little ice, double fine scotch?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan smiled wryly and nodded while selecting a song in the jukebox, his index finger searching for the correct button to press. He pushed ‘Under my thumb’, and turned to reply to Louis before setting off to settle in his usual barstool:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Very fine scotch.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Nothing but Scotland’s finest, Mr. Whittmore.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan sat on the barstool, his eyes staring at the glasses and various bottles of liquor neatly arrayed and featuring prominently in the shelves behind the bar. When he next spoke, it was with a feeling of relief:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’d never thought I’d say this, but God bless Nigeria.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Louis had assumed his proper place behind the bar, picked up a bottle of one of his finest malts from a cupboard below along with a short glass, and said smiling wryly while he poured:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’m from Guiana though.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Ah, and Scotch is from Scotland but it knows no borders. Come on then, pour one yourself.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The unusually tall, lank bartender complied and picked up a shot glass which he filled promptly and raised to a toast:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;To all the thirsty men.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Rolling Stones song had started playing in the background. Ethan raised his own glass of scotch and made a toast as well:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;To Mick Jagger and his crew.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
They both gulped down their drinks in one go. Ethan made a slight motion with one hand, indicating the cupboard below.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Louis went through the motions of pouring another glass of scotch and asked his regular customer for the past year or so with his usual air of cool affection:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;How’s life treating you?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan’s tone was lighthearted, almost flippant when he said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;A little better than horseshit. I’m not complaining though, I’m still here, aren’t I?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Louis laughed politely and nodded before replying:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’d be out of a job if you weren’t. Woe be me if something should happen to you.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Just keep the scotch coming and I’ll manage.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Loui let the glass of scotch slide across the wooden bar and looked him straight in the eye, his face almost a pale shade of dark under the dim candlelight of the bar:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;So, anything new from your friends in high places?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan shook his head and brought the glass to his lips, sniffing the aromas:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;No, nothing yet. It’s not easy, you know that. Not to mention the money involved. But it’ll take time Louis. Biafra is considered a little bit more important than your visa.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Louis shook his head in disappointment, and started polishing a basket full of washed glasses. His eyes were fixed to the task at hand when he replied to Ethan with a mixed feeling of sadness and slight aggravation, his movements lacking his usual crispness and finesse:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You said by the end of the month, Englishman. Said you knew the ‘ins and outs’, didn’t you? Who will keep Insami and Wadu off my back, I wonder. You, or your crown?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan kept wearing the same smile that had won him arguments on innumerable occasions, while he kept tapping his fingers to the rhythm of the song playing from the jukebox. After a short uncomfortable silence, he said to Louis:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;It must feel like a kick in the nuts, Louis, but it’s not as bad as you make it sound. Take a look around you. There’s bigger trouble than those two thugs. If they do pop up and act like a couple of tough govs, I’ll make sure they get one in the sack and lose a couple of teeth each. So take that off your mind. What do you have for me this time?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Louis seemed to relax a bit, his tense mouth loosening into a tight smile. He reached for a tall cupboard with a lock on the handles, and used a small key that hung from a chain around his neck. He opened the cupboard with small, graceful movements of his hands, as if opening an icon or a shrine. In it, a dozen bottles of Cullough sat, dusty and squat, seemingly quite authentic seal, cork and all. At the sight of the bottles of scotch and the prospect of savouring them at his leisure, Ethan’s face lit up and his blue eyes seemed for a moment to sparkle. His voice couldn’t contain his enthusiasm:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Cullough? Bugger me, I can’t even get close to this stuff even back home. You know the Cullough family is from WW_BIRTHPLACE. That’s William Wallace’s birthplace. Scotch indeed.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Loui asked with real curiosity while bringing down a bottle of Cullough carefully:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Never heard of a scotch by that name.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan blinked twice and was taken slightly aback when the name of the greatest Scotsman that ever lived was unheard of in this part of the world. He nevertheless straightened his back as if he was addressing the lords and ladies of the Backingham palace when he tried to explain to Loui. His accent suddenly became a bit heavier, rolling the l’s:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;William Wallace was the greatest scotsman that ever lived. Fought the English for the freedom of Scotland for over a dozen years. They killed his wife and family and in the end he was betrayed. He gave his all, William Wallace. Biggest set of stones ever.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Loui looked at Ethan in puzzlement as he uncorked the fine scotch, its aromas of cedar and mead wafted upwards. His question seemed to flatten Ethan’s face right at the moment his nostrils had become so excited:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;But Scotland isn’t free. You serve the Queen of England.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;That’s not entirely true, I serve the Queen of the United Kingdom.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;But there’s no Queen of the Scots, is there?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;She’s also Queen of the Scots. And the Welsh. And the Irish. Well, at least some of the Irish.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;See, that’s not unlike the situation here in Nigeria. The Igbo are like the Scots, they want to be free. Shouldn’t they be free?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I don’t have a say in that. It’s not my job, and it’s not my people. If they can, they will.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;And I’m just a bartender, Captain. I’m only saying. The Vietnamese, the Angolans, the Igbo, the Scots.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;The Beatles. The Stones. The Yardbirds. Some of those, I know and like. The rest, maybe I’ve heard of them, but their’s not my kind of tune. Now tend to your bar, please.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Loui smiled wryly and was about to retort when the door bell rang and attracted his attention. He looked up and pointed with his long bony index finger to a sturdy, tall and fit black man dressed in fatigues, the beret of the Nigerian Marine Corps smartly adorning his head. The man’s eyes peered vehemently through the haze and fog of the smoke and dust that seemed to always twirl lazily in the Metropolitaine.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The soldier’s gaze quickly settled on Ethan, who was spinning around on his barstool to look at the newcomer directly. He cracked a smile and gave a mocking half-salute to the burly man who - judging by his epaulets - appeared to be a brevet Major. The man did not seem to share the same good humor and did not salute, neither did he seem to enjoy smiles and levity a lot. As he approached the bar, Ethan cheerfully made a gesture at the still open cupboard full of Cullough and greeted the man with a proposition:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;James, this is a once in a lifetime chance for a once in a lifetime experience. It’s Cullough. It’s the nectar of the Gods. It’ll be monumental James, getting plastered with the finest scotch in the whole country, with little doubt. So, what is the unhappy occassion of your visit here in uniform? Tell me all about it so I can forget it with the help of Louis and Cullough. Is it remotely serious? Are the Biafrans hurtling shells at Lagos? Can I go home now?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The heavily set man, who otherwise seemed intimidating and capable of severely wounding a man armed with nothing but his hands, had a strangely calm and serene look in his face, as if he had suddenly drifted far away in his mind to a better place when he said calmly:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;It’s your brother. We have reports their caravan was probably attacked today. Somewhere in the jungle near the border. They never reached &lt;TOWN&gt;.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan looked suddenly somber and withdrawn. The news were a mood killer to say the least. He looked at James with wary, stern eyes:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Well, what is the Army going to do about it? The Red Cross is supposed to have its support. Where’s the support, James?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James took Ethan by the arm and told him in a friendly, casual manner that his external appearance belied:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Let’s have a drink, Ethan. Let’s talk.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Business in the Metropolitaine was in full swing. A small gang of sailors were celebrating one of their mates birthday, following the customary rule of drinking till the botswain comes looking for them. Loui kept a wary eye on a couple of strange figures, but other than that the orders kept coming in and that made him a happy man.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan on the other hand looked far from jovial. Indeed, news of losing contact with his brother had suddenly turned this war into a personal matter, something that every professional soldier tried to avoid. Making warfare personal also meant someone would do something stupid, and stupidity was a well-known but sadly overlooked factor in dying.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James had fallen silent for a couple minutes, silently sipping at his wine, a local unbottled variety without a fancy name or an extravagant price. Ethan was down to his last couple of cigarettes, chain-smoking ever since they sat down to talk. At length, Ethan broke the uncomfortable silence:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I should have pulled some strings when he told me he was going in with the Red Cross. Red tape, paperwork, passport trouble. Surely someone you know in the Interior could have been of some help. Maybe forced him to stay in Britain.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James motioned a definite ‘no’ with his head, eyes closed shut. He then had another sip before answering:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You know there are many ways to come into Nigeria. If your brother wanted to come, he would have found his own. There’s nothing you could have really done to prevent him from coming here in the first place.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan drew heavily on his cigarette and exhaled briskly. He spoke with some irritation:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;True enough, that. Maybe you could have detained him when their caravan set off for Biafra? I could have spoken some more sense into him.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James was as calm as before, answering with a flat and emotionless voice, trying to calm down Ethan as well:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Not with a Red Cross caravan. They’d rage about the Geneva convention, make too much fuss. Nigeria’s image is not exactly pristine, and noone likes headaches from the press. No, we could not have told your brother to just stay put. It was your job to do so if you wanted. Not mine, and certainly not Nigeria’s.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one go and motioned his empty glass to Loui who seemed to notice almost immediately. Ethan then looked straight into James’ eyes, a set of dark eyes accented by the small bit of white that surrounded them. He tried to calm himself and find the appropriate words:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You are right about that. It was my job. I should have just whipped him good like when we were still ten years old. But he’s a grown man, a doctor. He has his duties, his obligations. Like I have mine. Though I still think it’s stupid, at least he acted like the man he’s supposed to be. He wanted to help, he signed up with the Red Cross. Never saw how lying down on the grass all day long, doing weed and fucking like rabbits could stop people from dying. &rdquo;
</div>

There was a pause. Loui was returning to their table with Ethan’s refill of Cullough, and a clean ashtray. Ethan took his time before continuing, and nodded his thanks to Loui who bowed slightly and fleeted off to serve some other corner in the Metropolitaine. James had rested his arms on the table, his frame and build too large to comfortably seat himself in the Metropolitaine’s simple chairs. Ethan took a mouthful of Cullough and flinched when he felt it burn down through his throat and into his stomach. He then went on:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&rdquo;I know war’s no place for idealists and romantics, that’s probably why I’m still alive. I’ve seen it real up close and personal and I’d like none of that come knocking at my door again. Maybe I even think Andy’s doing a better job than I ever could. I mean, in the grander scheme of things, him being a doctor and all that. Can’t really tell why I didn’t stop him. I just couldn’t, you know?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James blinked languidly while sipping the last bit of his wine before replying:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Someone has to try and save the world. People like your brother think they can.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan’s face grimaced his slight annoyance at the suggestion, and lit up one of the last cigarettes in his pack.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Well, I don’t know. I’m not exactly in the business of saving people, am I? You could say we’re sort of antagonists, me and Andy. At least, we used to be in opposite teams when we balled.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I didn’t know you play cricket.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Haven’t ever since I got a leg injury in Kenya. Nasty business that was. Almost got meself killed. Young, stupid and rash. Also, quite a lucky bastard.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James expression seemed to change somewhat. He removed his hands from the table and for a moment sat still, looking at Ethan intensely. He then ordered another drink from Loui, who seemingly kept a watchful eye at their table more so than other tables and nodded promptly, going at the back for a couple minutes. When James spoke next, he was lighting up Ethan’s last cigarette, receiving nothing but the stunned surprise and deep furrow of Ethan:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Were you any good at it?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;What, cricket? I thought you didn’t smoke.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’m a man of many talents. And some vices as well.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Well, I hope you’re not a Rolling Stones fan as well. It’d be a real crime to find out you’ve been hiding that too.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James drew on his cigarette and threw his head back to blow off some smoke. He was smiling when he pointed to Ethan and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Not much to hide, Ethan. Sometimes I smoke. Usually when I’m alone. Which is really very little time. Barely enough for a smoke.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan nodded with a sly grin on his face. He sipped another mouthful from his glass of scotch which was disappearing fast. James went on:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I thought you were more like the football sort. Maybe even rugby. Or is golf the real scotsman’s sport?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan laughed despite his awry mood and laid back on the small chair:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Sometimes I wish they’d made drinking an official sport. I’m sure we’d have a good chance at the World Championship.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James was toying with the ice in his glass when a slight grin formed on his face, droplets of sweat running down his forehead, glistening dimly in the hazy, poor lighting of the Metropolitaine:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;A better chance than cricket, true enough. A bad leg won’t leave you behind.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;It isn’t just the bad leg. I’m not a cricket fan really, but Andy loves it. At least as a kid he did. Used to drag me along. The bad leg is just a reminder.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James seemed to stiffen suddenly. He straightened his back before reaching for his glass, but his words had a hint of mirth in them:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Memoris can hurt as well. What happened in Kenya? Tell me, I’m a fool for romantic stories.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan smiled while trying to down the last mouthful of Cullogh from his glass, and pointed to his mouth. When he did swallow it, his face contorted from the intense feeling of a wet fireball going down to his belly, but managed to respond in a timely manner:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Kenya, right. Nineteen sixty three. The yankees had just invaded Vietnam and my team had shipped out to Kenya as part of a counter-insurgency operation. The plan was to turn the various guerilla parties on each other, feeding disinformation and using scare tactics. We were supposed to make contact with a few loyalist bands, and organize a small force that would stop the insurrection in its heart. It was pretty complex, far-fetched and too optimistic. Very few men. No small wonder it failed. Of course that’s not why we lost Kenya.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan stopped for a moment when Loui came with James’ new glass of wine. He picked up Ethan’s empty glass and nodded with a wink, before leaving them alone once again. Somewhere in the opposite corner of the Metropolitaine a loud crashing noise was heard and Ethans fleeting gaze revealed the bunch of sailors strewn around over lots of broken glasses and a couple of upturned tables. A loud chorus of laughters was heard and once the noise resumed its regularly high levels, Ethan decided to go on:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;We were trying to rendezvous with a loyalist cell in the &lt;KENYA_REGION1&gt;, scout out the area, evaluate targets and then organize a strike to disorganize and demoralise the local rebel cells. Guerilla warfare textbook case. Anyway, first couple of nights in the jungle, all fine and dandy; nothing but mosquitoes, fucking jungle weather and bad sleep, which was to be expected in the bloody jungle.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
On the third night though, I woke up not with a kick in the me bollocks. I realise my hands are all tied up. Can’t fucking believe what’s going on; whole squad captured like a bunch of campers. The sentries were talking about the last fucking Millwall-Chelsea game. Long story short, we got caught with our pants down. They didn’t kill us outright, that would have been stupid and of no use. The Kenyans needed leverage, public approval, anything that would convince the parliament to say ‘balls off with Kenya, it’s not worth it’.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
We were eleven men on that squad. At first I thought they would exchange us, but then we noticed we were going around in circles somewhere in &lt;KENYA_REGION2&gt;, nothing like a plan. Like a long range patrol or whatnot. Our heavy gunner, McKinley, tried to make a run for it one day. He stumbled and tripped, dropped twenty feet down a cliff and broke both his legs. Their leader, a big brute of a man, shot him in the back of the head. Even said he was being merciful. That was when fucking bells started ringing in our heads.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
That cunt had it coming for him. We decided to have a go at them all together. We stopped for fresh water by a small river one day. While they were bathing, we ganged up on two of our guards. That’s when I got stabbed in the knee and tore up the ligaments. Nobody died though. Except that man. I drowned that fucker. Held him down in the river till my hands turned blue and I couldn’t feel them. First time I killed a man with my bare hands. We then hiked back through the jungle, the Kenyan’s in tow. Debriefing them gave some insight into the area, but a fat lot of good that did in the end. I got a demerit for losing McKinley and getting captured. Should’ve been a major by now.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan paused and drained his glass, real thirst driving him. James was looking at Ethan through bloodshot eyes, his glass of wine empty once more. He sat upright in his chair, drew audibly through his large nostrils on the thick air of the Metropolitaine and made a hand signal for another round of drinks, making sure that Louis brought two glasses of Cullough. Ethan sat across him, his gaze fixed on the ceiling fan above them. He looked distantly thoughtful, even slightly grim. He turned his eyes to his empty glass and spoke with a touch of anger behind each sentence:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I need to find my brother. I’ve never left a man behind in my life. Brought everyone back.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James seemed at once somber and surprised, his eyes narrowing dangerously:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Ethan, there’s a war going on. Going out deep in the jungle alone is.. A fool’s errand.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan picked up their drinks from Louis’ passing tray in mid-air, and replied:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;It’s not an errand, it’s something I must do. And I’m no fool either, I’m a scot.&rdquo; 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James stare had begun to pierce through Ethan’s eyes, casting a gaze hard as stone upon him:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You must be out of your mind.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan nodded in agreement, and James voice had a slow quality about it that showed his determination:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You’ll need all the help you can get then. If it’s going to have any meaning at all, that is.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan cracked a smile and drank a tiny sip of Cullough, noticing he was almost out of scotch. Louis then appeared out of nowhere with the grace of a dancer. He offered them the bottle of Cullough he had opened earlier. There was barely enough scotch in it for just another drink. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Gentlemen, compliments of the house. And you can keep the bottle too, if you like.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan nodded his thanks and laughed despite himself, while James still sat there looking at Ethan seemingly unable to discern whether or not the man was simply drunk and already grieving, making up ideas. He asked Ethan, the stress in his voice showing he wanted to be convinced:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You are sure you are going to do this? I want to help. But I want to know I’m not risking my neck for some jungle antiques, Ethan Whittmore. And it could mean my neck. I need you to be deadly serious. All the way.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan’s reply was as sharp as his pervasive eyes:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I got nothing left other than my brother. Nothing that matters. My job’s a joke nowdays. Can’t settle down somewhere. No woman can stand around me longer than my cock in her cunt. Andy’s all I got left that hasn’t hurt me. What good am I for if don’t go looking for him?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James shrugged, his large set of shoulders tensing up his fatigues almost to the point of tearing. He then told Ethan:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;He could be already dead, you know that. Sure he might be a white English doctor, but no matter how useful he may prove, bullets are not very picky.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan was not backing out:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Then I’ll bring back the body to Inverness and lay him in the ground. I’ll do what I can, James. Anything.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;So, are you going to just quit tomorrow?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan smiled bitterly and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Maybe I should. They wouldn’t let me though. Operational needs, lack of personnel, that sort of thing. The service wants to fuck you three ways to Australia if they can. Can’t even put in for leave, not at such a short notice. Can you arrange some sort of training exercise? Any reason that will demand me being attached to somewhere outside Lagos. Gone for a week or two. If all goes well, then I’ll see what I’ll do. If not, it won’t matter from then on.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James took a mouthful of Cullough without preparing himself. Unaccustomed to strong liquor as he was, he looked as if he was about to vomit on the spot but he managed to contain himself. He shook his head in affirmation and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I can do that. I will do more than that. I can keep you informed; give you locations, troop movements, anything that regularly passes through me. Anything that would help you find your brother and keep you alive at the same time. It would be like a real operation. In fact, I can cook up a ‘real’ operation. We can then use radio traffic to keep in contact without suspicion.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Can you do that? I’ll need to leave as soon as possible. Tomorrow night, the day after tomorrow at the latest. I have to pack my gear, and borrow a couple of things as well. Then I need to do some itinerary checking.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Are you going to follow the same path as your brother’s caravan?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Yes, all they way. I’ll start from Lagos, to &lt;TOWN2&gt;, then &lt;TOWN3&gt;, through &lt;AREA&gt;, and into Biafran territory. From then on, it’s &lt;TOWN_TO_WHERE_CARAVAN_WAS_HEADED&gt;.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James nodded appreciatively. He asked with some worry:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;What happens when you’re in Biafra? What happens if you find your brother?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You mean when I find Andy. Bring him back, what else?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I mean, how do you plan to do that? What if he’s injured? A prisoner or a hostage? What if he’s weak, or sick? Don’t tell me you’ll hitch a ride back or carry him yourself if you have to.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I will if I have to.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Are all scots as foolish as you?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan furrowed his brow and was ready to erupt in a flurry of patriotic rage, when James words disarmed him:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’ll bring a helicopter. We can arrange a landing zone through the radio. Of course, if we lose contact, we’ll have two pre-determined LZs. I hope it doesn’t need to get to that.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You’ll do that?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Helicopters make flights all the time. Now, where they fly to, that can always be a little hazy. I don’t have my pilot wings for show, Ethan.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan grinned at the hint of mischief. James landed him abruptly once more though:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;What are you going to do when in Biafra though? How are you going to run around, an Englishman like you, with no papers whatsoever? Or are you just going to let everyone know you’re a military advisor for the Nigerians, so they can perhaps torture you before shooting you on the spot?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I have something in mind for that. I have some contacts through the embassy. They should be able to forge some papers, make me look legitimate. A photographer, or a journalist. Someone who can get in and out with relative impunity.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;There’s no such thing as impunity. Tolerance maybe. A journalist would be a good cover, they’re always looking for sympathy from the press.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan look at James as if he knew he was already asking too much of his Nigerian friend, but nevertheless went on and asked him:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;James, you’ve been a good friend while I’m here, helping me ease into the situation. We’re like-minded, you are a damned good professional if I’ve ever seen one, but why are you doing this for me? It can’t be that you’re risking so much at such a time just to help a white man from Scotland. I do consider you an honest comrade, a friend I wish I can drool with over a bottle of scotch when I’m hopefully old enough to pee on my pants. But tell me, why exactly are you doing this? If it’s about money, I assure you I ..&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James slapped Ethan hard across the face, the shock from the hit leaving him dazzled for a while. His words came harsh and strong, chastising Ethan:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’ve never felt more insulted in my life. You have a knack, all the Englishmen it seems. You’re so blind to what’s really right in front of you. I consider you a friend too, so I’ll take this as a slip of the tongue. You’re under emotional pressure, you’ve had some drinks.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James calmed down somewhat, and the timbre of his voice turned to an affable voice, a voice unusually soft and mellow, full of memory and sentiment:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;You want to know why I want to help you with whatever means at my disposal? It’s because I consider you a friend as well. Mostly though because I too, had a brother once. A brother who helped me grow into the man I am today, who buried our dead mother with his own hands, and who carried our father on his back for miles every time he needed to see a doctor. I lost that brother. I lost Enkele. I lost him and while I could have done something about it, I simply watched him go away, never to return. So, I’ve been in your place Ethan. I know you’re doing what I should have done years ago. And I want you to find your brother. That, I swear unto God.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan took James by the arm and smiled broadly, despit himself:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I’m sorry my friend. I’m sorry I offended you, and sorry I brought those memories back. You’ve never told me much about him. Isn’t it strange, how life weaves itself around fate sometimes?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James laughed mirthlessly before replying:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;And noone can escape the webs of fate, Ethan. We should remember that.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan emptied the rest of his glass in one go, and pour what little was left in the bottle of Cullough to the both of them. He then raised his glass in a toast:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;To Andy.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And James replied:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;To Enkele.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="center">
* * *
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The British embassy in Lagos was the typical colonial building of the Africas, resplendent and austere, an indubitable legacy of the Empire. Its tall thick windows shone with the brightness of the noon sun when Ethan walked through the front gate saluting the guard on duty only perfunctorily. He eased down the main corridor, and without even answering a couple of greetings from Embassy staff, he dived straight into the intelligence office on the 2nd floor. He knocked briskly on the open door labeled Cultural Affairs, and entered without pausing for an answer.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There he found a man in his late fifties, short and miniscule, who sported a thick mustache, an almost completely bald scalp and a pair of old-fashioned ebony-rimmed glasses. The label on his desk read ‘Isidor Bloom - Director of Cultural Affairs’. He immediately popped a smile and addressed Ethan like a good friend or a close acquaintance. Even though they had only occassionally met at a couple of Embassy dinners, he offered his hand in a lively, warm way and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;How do you do? Jolly good I hope, old friend. Please, do have a seat. Now, what was it that you wanted to speak to me about? I believe on the phone you said it was an urgent personal matter that somehow involved my desk. Would you care to elaborate? I can only be of real help if I know what we’re dealing with here, you know. In strictest of confidence, of course.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan shook the hand but still felt somehow a little out of depth, his inherent distrust of spies kicking in despite the man’s cordial manner. Unaccustomed to protocol and etiquette, Ethan dived straight into the matter and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Mr. Bloom, I need a cover.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Isidor Bloom blinked once or twice with an unwavering smile, and seemingly quite baffled, replied:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;I beg your pardon, what kind of cover are you talking about Mr. Whittmore?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Before Ethan had time to elaborate, Mr. Bloom had furrowed his brow, waving a ‘no-no’ finger at Ethan. He got up from his chair and leisurely closed the door of his office. Ethan could only frown with genuine puzzlement while Mr. Bloom sat down again comfortably, lit his smoking pipe and had a puff.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Do you ask for a cunt when walking into a brothel, Mr. Whittmore? In such delicate matters, a little more room for maneuver is usually required. You’d ask for a girl or a woman, perhaps even some company. Not for a cunt, which is the reason for visiting a brothel. Are you following me, son?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan looked ever more perplexed, especially by the sudden change of mood in the middle-aged man. He understood he had been too blunt, but while trying to think what to say next and especially how to apologise, the old spy got to him first:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Listen old chap, everybody knows what we’re doing here, and everyone including us, knows we’re just doing pottery and traditional art exhibitions. Thursday’s bagpipe night, though. Savvy?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan nodded numbly despite not actually understanding all too well what the man was trying to get at. Mr. Bloom saw the confusion written on Ethan’s face and after sighing slightly, continued:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;To make things easier for you, and expediate the process. Is there someone I can call on your behalf? Someone who can help me, help you?&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
At that, Ethan replied automatically:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Yes, sir. That would be Ian Ruthers, a personal friend.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As suddenly as before, Mr. Bloom’s attitude swapped back to his jovial, well-mannered and quite expedient self. Wearing an almost disconcertingly wide grin on his face, he picked up the phone on his desk, dialed a single number, and said:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Yes? Jenny? Put me through to Bristol. Yes, yes, definitely.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A small wait ensued, which was reason enough for Ethan to start sweating even though the temperature inside the room was quite pleasant. Mr. Bloom kept smiling and nodding in a reassuring fashion, which only accentuated the feeling of weirdness and anxiety that had crept up over Ethan. Then, Mr. Bloom was heard talking over the phone:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Yes? Leonard? Yes, it’s me Isidor. Long time no see, but it’s business again I’m afraid. Is Ruthers one of yours? I see. Is he hot? No? Aha. Tell him to give me a call. Yes, my office. Well, now would be indeed a perfect time. I’d like to get on with this before lunch. Yes, well she’s fine. Working on her garden. How’s Marie? Loved her cherry pie last Christmas. Would love to, old chap. Have your man call me, alright then? Goodbye.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once he hang up the phone, Mr. Bloom surprised Ethan once again with his next words:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Fucking cunt can sod off. Now, let’s clear a few things: This friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod off as well. If he’s going to push something for me down my pipe, fine and all. I don’t give fuckall about the why or how, I’m going home to Cheltenham before Christmas, and this desk can rot on my piss. And just so that you know, the cock around here tastes awful so brush often. Bloody poofters.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
With that last weird and almost unintelligible remark, Mr. Bloom put out his pipe, placed it in his shirt pocket, picked up his hat and strolled out of his office, carefull to smoothly close the door behind him.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly had transpired. The only certainty was that Mr. Bloom needed to get off that job of his badly. Ethan’s thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing. Thinking it should be Ruthers on the other end of the phone, Ethan picked up the phone:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
&ldquo;Hello? Ian? It’s Ethan Whittmore. Well, I know. Didn’t expect to hear me on this end, did you? What am I doing here? Well, first of all — yes, I know I’m terrible. No, it wasn’t — I know I shouldn’t be even talking to you like this but I need some help, Ian. No! I’m not married. Can you be serious for a minute? How you’re working for Six I’ll never understand. Well, now that I saw the guy in the Nigerian desk perhaps I do understand. Listen. Just listen. I need some cover. It’s Andy, my brother. I need to go into Biafra. No joke. There will be no widow to comfort, so stop being a cunt and help me over here. Right, then. A piece of paper? I’m on it.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="center">

</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="phantom"></span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
James rolled a cigarette. Real tobacco, confiscated from customs. A smile, a joke and a tap in the back will go a long way. Especially when you’re six feet tall and slightly less stocky than a bull. That was something that Ethan had told him. A piece of wisdom from Britain’s finest.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen table. Some fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly serrated set of tiny teeth. The smell of roast dominated the room and an open window showed the grill on the small porch, a few coals settling down, their heat meaningless in the summer night of Lagos.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A wedding feast was being held in the next street, the gathered crowd like a colourful centipede, dancing and singing like it had a mind of its own, however small. James peered mirthlessly at the small spectacle, and stared blankly for a minute or two, as if trying to remember a detail, a name or a place.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
They brought the groom to the fore, all dressed up and smiling, and rained him with flowers and gifts, his face shining almost imperceptibly with a gold sheen that somehow seemed only natural under the light of the torches. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James’ arm, and it shook instinctively, ash marking the spot of the slight burn. He didn’t flinch though, nor did he notice his cigarette was out. The phone in the bedroom was ringing with a mindless persistence that a salesman would envy.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When James finally got up from his chair, the phone was ringing once more. He stormed outside dressed in nothing but shorts, and ran towards the moving wedding feast. As he ran, he wiped his tongue across his lips and couldn’t know if he tasted his tears or his sweat the most.
