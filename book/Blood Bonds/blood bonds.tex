\chapter{In her Majesty's service}

Sweat ran freely down the red-haired Englishman's temples, smearing
the jungle camo on his clean-shaven face. A knife blade covered in
dry mud sat in his left hand, while his other hand made a rough circle
in the air. It was a hand signal for the command to encircle the target.

Five men melted away into the green humid jungle in a heartbeat, as
if they had been an optical illusion. They moved fast; faster than
what Ethan had believed them capable of. He decided to stand back
for a little while more, and see how they could handle their approach
on their own.

All of them stopped dead in their tracks and hunched low when they
heard noise, probably from the direction of the clearing up ahead.
The two men that formed the edge of the squad aimed their rifles outwards
from the squad, as if a switch had been thrown. The point man laid
himself flat with the silken grace of a cat, knife drawn in his right
hand while his left hand reached out for his Colt zero-point-forty-five.
The rearguard moved like a pair of dancers, covering each other's
back, both aiming their rifles from shoulder-high, safeties clicked
off to single-shot selection.

In that cautious small diamond formation they moved as a whole, each
step forward made with practiced ease and well-earned confidence,
the mark of a well-trained soldier. For all intends and purposes,
and as far as Ethan was concerned, he had done a good job training
them. What did bother him though was that they had yet to fire a shot
in anger. He knew that nothing tests a man like real combat.

Though they moved precisely as they had been taught, and seemed quick
and stealthy enough, Ethan couldn't really tell if they just went
through the motions or if they were really up for the challenge. After
all, no matter how much one practices before a show, it's the opening
night that makes or breaks it.

Ethan's free hand was wrapped tightly around a metal L-shaped trigger
attached to a small box no larger than a pack of cigarettes, from
which a run of cables protruded and got lost somewhere under the rich
jungle tapestrie of green and brown. With a tight grin, Ethan whispered
to himself with the expectation of a job well done:

{}``Showtime, lads.''

When he double-clicked the trigger the first thing that attracted
everyone's attention were the flashes. And then came the shockwaves,
their force pummeling at everyone, making every ribcage vibrate intensely
as if tremors had seized them. And that was just the opening note.

Small gun fire erupted from various well-placed locations, the muzzle
flashes dotting the lavish scenery as if hundreds of photographers
clicked in rapid succession.

The scouts instantly dived for cover, falling prone while keeping
their arcs of fire fimly fixed to their own particular zone of responsibility.
A wry smile formed on Ethan's face: he seemed to be enjoying the performance.

The five trainees were on their bellies, rolling and crawling over
the jungle bed in an effort to find as much cover as possible in mere
moments. They exchanged quick glances and made repetitive hand motions
to each other, communicating silently trying to establish a point
where they could fall back away from the guns blazing at them.

Every tree trunk and low bush or gully counted for gold at times like
these, and the five Marine scouts from the 3rd Marine division made
excellent use of their surroundings. Very much so that Ethan felt
a twang of pride at seeing his handiwork in action. They were his
men, and they seemed every bit as professional as he intended them
to be.

They quickly abandoned their exposed position for a slightly shallow
depression with good cover, fat tree trunks strewn around them with
thick bush for cover and a clear view on all sides. A defendable position
from which they could easily spot a move against them and fall back
while they harassed their enemy firing and moving in turns. Ethan's
mind flashed with the sudden realisation they were good enough to
be Royal Marine scouts, not just Nigerian troops.

He almost felt a hint of regret he couldn't be there with them when
it really mattered, when the guns pointing towards them were not loaded
with blanks; when the explosive charges half a mile away were real
shells and mortars falling right on them. 

Almost, as Ethan reminded himself inside his head, was the eminent
keyword: This was not his war, not by a far chance, and setting up
mock engagements such as this one was as close as he wanted to get
to another warzone. Except for the times when he itched, except for
the times he woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat,
knowing it wasn't the tropical heat that left him sleepless thereafter,
but faces all too well remembered and defined.

The team of five men had dug themselves in taking solid cover. The
gunfire died down soon afterwards, and Ethan believed there was no
point in continuing tracking and crossing the jungle. He had seen
what he wanted to see, and that was a team of scouts, not a bunch
of gung-ho Nigerians hollering with rifles raised firing on auto,
vying for Igbo blood.

Ethan raised himself above the brushes and bellowed as if he wanted
the cadets back at Sandhurst to hear him clear as rain:

{}``End of session! Fine job lads!''

The team of five gave no sign of sight or sound that they had heard
their instructor. Ethan repeated himself with less enthusiasm:

{}``Come on, games' over! Let's head back for some rest, off we go.''

Still, nothing could be now heard other than the usual sounds of the
jungle, the distant cries of birds and monkeys, and the constant buzzing
of mosquitoes and other assorted exotic insects.

Ethan furrowed his brow and briefly considered that the team might
have actually extracted themselves without him noticing, and decided
to check the small depression himself. With a hurried pace, he made
his way through the brush and in a few moments reached the position
he had last seen them take cover in.

He saw noone, but suddenly felt a piece of metal poking him through
his left side, right between his ribs, poised to pierce his heart
at a single thrust. He had been caught unawares, and once he looked
sideways to his assailant, he saw Onko, the team scout leader smiling
wildly, his bright white teeth a stark contrast to his camouflaged
dark face. A little stunned and a little bit surprised, Ethan barely
had time to let off a curse:

{}``Bugger me, you've grown into a real scout Idowu.''

No longer wearing the same disarming smile, the nigerian marine responded
with a heavy accent, the nigerian pronunciation thick and strong:

{}``You grow soft, Captain Whittmore.''

Onko then sheathed his knife, and the four other men suddenly appeared
from quite unlikely and widespread places, from any one of which they
could have put a bullet through Ethan at their leisure.

Ethan nodded and made a small sigh, as if acknowledging he had indeed
let his guard down and been overcome, exactly what he tought his recruits
should never happen, not even while not in the battlefield. Cultivating
a little paranoia went a long way in keeping a man alive, especially
in a civil war where telling a friend from an enemy was not as clean
a business as shooting at one.

Ethan did manage to save some face though when he pointed at his feet
to a small bump in the ground, leaves cluttered all over it and said:

{}``See now Ibrahim, that's a mark for a landmine. You might have
killed at least one man when you chose to fall back here.''

Onko seemed far from smiling at that comment, and with a mixed expression
midpoint between anger and disappointment he said to Ethan, making
it sound almost like an accusation:

{}``There was no place else to fall back and cover, Captain. It was
a death trap then, for sure. What could we have done different? Not
fair, sir.''

The word `sir' had a strange ring to it, and that probably was because
it was meant to sound off-putting. Ethan only cared to answer briefly
right before he turned about and started walking to the gathering
area of the training field:

{}``All's fair in love and war, sergeant. Says so somewhere, I'm
pretty sure of that.''

In the warm light of neon orange, Ethan searched his pockets for the
some small change, but to no avail. He rarely needed dimes and pennies
when he made his cosmopolitan visits to the center of Lagos, but using
the jukebox in Loui's bar was such an occasion, and even more so a
favourite habit.

In fact, Ethan was not a rare visitor to Loui's establishment, and
most would instantly recognise him. He was widely known as the Englishman,
both to the few locals and the numerous extraordinary foreigners that
frequented the Metropolitaine.

Ethan maintained that he only came for the regularly up-to-date jukebox,
whilst his tab indicated a thirsty sort of music lover with a certain
taste for fine malts.

Malts such as the unusually fine scotch that Loui kept stashed for
the well-off or even well-liked customer. He had simply decided to
thank God there was good scotch to be found in a place like Nigeria
and even more so in a bar like Loui's. To make the realisation even
more mind-numbing for Ethan, there was good scotch to be found during
what the Nigerian government chose to characterise as a `crisis'.
The Metropolitaine's crude and shanty decoration, or more appropriately
its blatant lack thereof only helped to somehow accentuate that a
war was going on.

A couple of ceiling fans still worked despite what one might expect
at first sight, barely keeping the air from going stale.

It was with his usual wide grin that Louis, the proprietor, approached
Ethan and offered him a penny before bowing slightly, impeccably dressed
in a striped jacket, white pressed shirt, bowtie and smart pants,
an air of the thirties Paris about him. Ethan accepted the coin gladly
and immediately dropped it in the slot, while Louis chimed in his
blatantly french but not unbearable accent:

{}``Compliments of the house, Capitain. The usual? Little ice, double
fine scotch?''

Ethan smiled wryly and nodded while selecting a song in the jukebox,
his index finger searching for the correct button to press. He pushed
`Under my thumb', and turned to reply to Louis before setting off
to settle in his usual barstool, the bar solely at his disposal at
that hour:

{}``Very fine scotch.''

{}``Nothing but Scotland's finest, Mr. Whittmore.''

Ethan sat on the barstool, his eyes staring at the glasses and various
bottles of liquor neatly arrayed and featuring prominently in the
shelves behind the bar. When he next spoke, it was with a feeling
of relief:

{}``I'd never thought I'd say this, but God bless Nigeria.''

Louis had assumed his proper place behind the bar when he picked up
a bottle of one of his finest malts from a cupboard below along with
a short glass, and said smiling wryly while he poured:

{}``I'm from Guiana though.''

{}``Ah, and Scotch is from Scotland but it knows no borders. Come
on then, pour one yourself.''

The unusually tall, lank bartender complied and picked up a shot glass
which he filled promptly and raised to a toast:

{}``To all the thirsty men.''

The Rolling Stones song had started playing in the background. Ethan
raised his own glass of scotch and made a toast as well:

{}``To Mick Jagger and crew.''

They both gulped down their drinks in one go. Ethan made a slight
motion with one hand, indicating the cupboard below.

Louis went through the motions of pouring another glass of scotch
and asked his regular customer for the past year or so with his usual
air of cool affection:

{}``How's life treating you?''

Ethan's tone was lighthearted, almost flippant when he said:

{}``Not sure. Better than horseshit? I'm not complaining though.
Still 'ere, aren't I?''

Louis laughed politely and nodded before replying:

{}``Woe be me if something should happen to you. Losing customers,
I cannot afford that?''

{}``You're not losing me soon enough. Keep the scotch coming, and
I'll manage.''

Louis let the glass of scotch slide across the wooden bar and looked
Ethan straight in the eye, his face almost a pale shade of dark under
the dim candlelight surrounding the bar:

{}``What news from your friends in high places?''

Ethan shook his head and made a strange, sour face for a moment. He
brought the glass to his lips, sniffing the aromas:

{}``Nothing yet. It's not easy, you knew that. Not to mention there's
money involved. But it'll take time Louis. Your visa isn't exactly
top priority.''

Louis shook his head in disappointment, and started polishing a basket
full of washed glasses. His eyes were fixed to the task at hand when
he replied to Ethan with a mixed feeling of sadness and slight aggravation,
his movements lacking his usual crispness and finesse:

{}``You said by the end of the month, Englishman. Said you knew the
`ins and outs', didn't you? Who will keep Insami and Wadu off my back,
I wonder. Make it top priority, can you?''

Ethan kept wearing the same smile that had won him arguments on innumerable
occasions, while he kept tapping his fingers to the rhythm of the
song playing from the jukebox. After a short uncomfortable silence,
he said to Louis:

{}``It must feel like a kick in the nuts, Louis, but remember, I'm
doing you a favor. Take a look around you. There's bigger trouble
than those two thugs. There's a war going on. If they do pop up and
act like a couple of tough guvs, I'll make sure they get one in the
sack and lose a couple of teeth each. No use worrying about it now.''

Louis looked a bit distraught, his eyes somewhat dull from wariness.
Ethan tried to change the subject:

''What do you have for me this time? Auchentoshan? Glenfiddich? ''

Louis became his professional self again; he seemed to relax a bit,
his tense mouth loosening into a tight smile. He reached for a tall
cupboard with a lock on the handles, and used a small key that hung
from a chain around his neck. He opened the cupboard with small, graceful
movements of his hands, as if opening an icon or a shrine. In it,
a dozen bottles of Littlemill sat, dusty and squat, seemingly quite
authentic seal, cork and all. At the sight of the bottles of scotch
and the prospect of savouring them at his leisure, Ethan's face lit
up and his blue eyes seemed for a moment to sparkle. His voice couldn't
contain his enthusiasm:

{}``Littlemill? Thirty-two years old, triple distillation. Bugger
me, oldest malt in Scotland. Let me see that bottle.''

Louis complied even though anyone could tell from his face he was
quite puzzled. Ethan was usually interested in the contents, not the
labels.

{}``Here you go, englishman.''

Ethan completely disregarded the bartender's effort at a light-hearted
insult and studied the bottle's labels with focused interest. At length,
he nodded appreciatively before adding:

''From Ayrshire, too.''

Loui asked with real curiosity while opening the bottle of Littlemill
Ethan was still clutching like a scepter:

{}``Is that the place for the best scotch?''

Ethan let go of the bottle and while Louis put a single cube of ice
in Ethan's glass, he continued, his expression emanating a scholarly
aura:

{}``'Tis the ancestral birthplace of the greatest scot that ever
lived. William Wallace.''

The name of the famous scottish hero was intoned with reverence and
pride. It seemed to have no effect on the Guinean bartender who casually
asked:

{}``Who is he?''

Ethan blinked twice and was taken slightly aback when the name of
the greatest Scotsman that ever lived rang no bell. He nevertheless
straightened his back and breathed deeply when he tried to explain
to Loui.

{}``William Wallace was the greatest scotsman that ever lived. Fought
the English for the freedom of Scotland for over a dozen years. They
killed his wife and family and in the end he was betrayed. He gave
his all, William Wallace. Biggest set of stones ever.''

Loui looked at Ethan in puzzlement as he uncorked the fine scotch,
its smoky aroma wafting upwards, arousing the senses. His question
seemed to flatten Ethan's face right at the moment his nostrils had
become so excited:

{}``But Scotland isn't free. You serve the Queen of England.''

{}``That's not entirely true, I serve the Queen of the United Kingdom.''

{}``But there's no Queen of the Scots, is there?''

{}``She's also Queen of the Scots. And the Welsh. And the Irish.
Well, at least some of the Irish.''

{}``See, that's not unlike the situation here in Nigeria. The Igbo
are like the Scots, they want to be free. Shouldn't they be free?''

{}``I don't have a say in that. It's not my job, and it's not my
people. If they can, they will. And if you want to know, my father
might have been born in Glasgow but I grew up in Kensington, so piss
off with the Scots and all that. Pour, for the love of God.''

Louis smiled wryly before he retorted:

{}``You brought the subject to my attention, Captain.''

Ethan was starting to get properly wound up when the door bell rang
and attracted his attention. He looked up from his drink and saw Louis
pointing with his long bony index finger to a sturdy, tall and fit
black man dressed in fatigues, the beret of the Nigerian Marine Corps
smartly adorning his head. The man's eyes peered vehemently through
the haze and fog of the smoke and dust that seemed to always twirl
lazily in the Metropolitaine.

The soldier's gaze quickly settled on Ethan, who was spinning around
on his barstool to look at the newcomer directly. He cracked a smile
and gave a mocking half-salute to the burly man who - judging by his
epaulets - appeared to be a brevet Major. The man did not seem to
share the same good humor and did not salute, neither did he seem
to enjoy smiles and levity a lot. As he approached the bar, Ethan's
mood had swung again towards his sweet side and he cheerfully made
a gesture at the still open cupboard full of Littlemill, greeting
the man with a proposition:

{}``James, this is a once in a lifetime chance for a once in a lifetime
experience. It's Littlemill. It's the nectar of the Gods. It'll be
monumental James; getting plastered with the finest scotch in the
whole country, with little doubt. So, what is the unhappy occassion
of your visit here in uniform? Tell me all about it so I can forget
it with the help of Louis and Littlemill. Is it remotely serious?
Are the Biafrans hurtling shells at Lagos? Can I go home now?''

The heavily set man had a quite intimidating appearance. The capability
of severely wounding a man armed with nothing but his hands was the
usual first impression. At odds with his brutal image he had a strangely
calm and serene demeanor, a grim look on his face that implied his
mind was occupied with grave matters. He approached Ethan and taking
off his beret he calmly said:

{}``It's your brother, Ethan. We have reports their caravan was probably
attacked today. Somewhere in the jungle near the border. They never
reached Owerri.''

Ethan's smile evaporated. He suddenly looked somber and withdrawn.
The news were a mood killer to say the least. He looked at James with
wary, stern eyes:

{}``Red Cross is supposed to have Army support. Where was their support,
James?''

James' bulky shoulders shook with a disarmingly vulnerable shrug.
He embraced Ethan with a single arm and told him in a friendly, casual
manner:

{}``Let's have a drink, Ethan. Let's talk.''

\vphantom{}

Business in the Metropolitaine was in full swing. A small gang of
sailors were celebrating one of their mates birthday, following the
custom of drinking till the botswain comes looking for them. Louis
kept a wary eye on a couple of strange-looking figures, but other
than that the orders kept coming in and that made him a happy man.

Ethan was sitting opposite James at a small round metal table in a
corner near the bar, looking far from jovial. What James had told
him had suddenly turned this war into a personal matter, something
that every professional soldier tried to avoid. A well-known but sadly
overlooked factor in dying was doing stupid things for all the wrong
reasons, and making a war something personal was both stupid and wrong.

James had fallen silent for a couple minutes silently sipping at his
wine, a local plonk variety that barely passed the mark. Ethan was
down to his last couple of cigarettes, chain-smoking ever since they
had sat down to talk. At length, Ethan broke the uncomfortable silence:

{}``I should have pulled some strings when he told me he was going
in with the Red Cross. Red tape, paperwork, passport trouble. Surely
someone you know in the Interior could have been of some help. Maybe
forced him to stay in Britain, somehow. Don't know, really.''

James motioned a definite `no' with his head, eyes closed shut. He
then had another sip before answering:

{}``You know there are many ways to come into Nigeria. If your brother
wanted to come, he would have found his own. There's nothing you could
have really done to prevent him from coming here in the first place.''

Ethan drew heavily on his cigarette and exhaled briskly. He spoke
with some irritation:

{}``True enough, that. Maybe you could have detained him when their
caravan set off for Biafra? I could have spoken some more sense into
him. It doesn't matter now, does it?''

James was as calm as before, answering with a flat and emotionless
voice, trying to calm down Ethan as well:

{}``Not a Red Cross caravan. How would it look in the papers if Nigeria
blocked the Red Cross? It would look like we want to let children
die of dysentery and famine. No, we could not have told your brother
to just stay put. It was not my job, and not yours either. It was
his choice, his life.''

Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one go
and made a gesture with his empty glass to Louis who seemed to notice
almost immediately. Ethan then looked straight into James' eyes; a
set of dark eyes accented by the small bit of white that surrounded
them. He tried to calm himself and find the appropriate words:

{}``You are right about that.. Maybe I should have just whipped him
good like when we were still ten years old. But he's a grown man,
a doctor no less. He has his duties, his obligations. Like I have
my own. Though I still think it was a stupid thing to do, at least
he acted like the man he's supposed to be. He wanted to help, he signed
up with the Red Cross. Never really saw meself how lying down on the
grass all day long, smoking grass and fucking like rabbits could stop
people from dying. Still, a stupid move coming here.''

There was a pause. Louis was returning to their table with Ethan's
refill of Littlemill and a clean ashtray. Ethan nodded his thanks
to Louis who in turn bowed slightly and fleeted off to serve some
other table. James had rested his arms on their table, his frame too
large to comfortably seat himself in the Metropolitaine's plain chairs.
Ethan took a mouthful of Littlemill and flinched when he felt the
malt burn down his throat and into his stomach. He then went on:

''I know, war's no place for idealists and romantics. That's probably
why I'm still alive. That, and an awful amount of luck, I'd wager.
Maybe Andy's doing a better job than I ever could. I mean, in the
grander scheme of things, him being a doctor and all that. Can't really
tell why I didn't stop him. I just couldn't, you know?''

James blinked languidly and sipped the last bit of his wine. He set
his glass down with a clang before replying:

{}``Someone has to try and save the world. People like your brother
think they can. Like every hero should.''

James grunted with a hint of disapproval and Ethan grimaced with slight
annoyance at that contemptive gesture. He lit up one of the last cigarettes
in his pack and inhaled thoroughly:

{}``Well, I wouldn't know. I'm not exactly in the business of saving
people, am I? You could say we're sort of antagonists, me and Andy.
Kind of reminds me, we used to be in opposite teams when we balled.''

{}``I didn't know you play cricket.''

{}``Haven't ever since I got a leg injury in Kenya. Nasty business
that was. Almost got meself killed. Young, stupid and rash. Also,
quite a lucky bastard.''

James expression seemed to change somewhat. He removed his hands from
the table and for a moment sat still, looking at Ethan intensely.
He then ordered another drink from Loui, who seemed to keep a watchful
eye at their table more so than the others and nodded promptly, disappearing
at the back for a couple of minutes. When James spoke next, he was
lighting up Ethan's last cigarette, Ethan affording nothing but a
stunned surprise and a deep furrow:

{}``Were you any good at it?''

{}``What, cricket? I thought you didn't smoke.''

{}``I'm a man of many talents. And some vices as well.''

{}``Well, I hope you're not a Rolling Stones fan as well. It'd be
a real crime to find out you've been hiding that too.''

James drew on his cigarette and threw his head back, letting off a
small cloud of smoke. He was smiling when he pointed to Ethan and
said:

{}``Not much to hide, Ethan. Sometimes I smoke. Usually alone.''

Ethan nodded with a sly grin on his face. He sipped another mouthful
from his glass of scotch which was disappearing fast. James was toying
with the ice in his glass when a slight grin formed on his face, droplets
of sweat running down his forehead, glistening dimly in the hazy,
poor lighting of the Metropolitaine:

{}``A better chance than cricket, true enough. A bad leg won't leave
you behind.''

{}``It isn't just the bad leg. I'm not a cricket fan really. Andy
loves it though. At least as a kid he did. Used to drag me along.
The bad leg is just a reminder.''

James seemed to stiffen suddenly. He straightened his back before
reaching for his glass, his voice a bit shallow and distant:

{}``Which is worse, Ethan? The memories, or the leg?''



{}``It's the memories alright. Hadn't seen him in four years. Rarely
called. Never wrote. He must've thought I couldn't care less. But
it's the job, you know? The distance.''

James interjected mildly:

{}``The scotch too?''

Ethan drained his glass, as if a real thirst was driving him and answered:

{}``That too.''

James was looking at him through bloodshot eyes, his glass of wine
empty once more. He sat upright in his chair, drew audibly through
his large nostrils on the thick air of the Metropolitaine and made
a hand signal for another round of drinks, making sure that Louis
brought two glasses of Littlemill. Ethan's gaze was fixed on the ceiling
fan above them. He looked distantly thoughtful, grim and withdrawn,
far from his usual self. He turned his eyes to his empty glass and
spoke with a touch of anger behind each sentence:

{}``I need to find my brother. I've never left a man behind in my
life. Brought everyone back. I can't leave me own brother behind.
It's Andy for God's sake, hasn't hurt a fly in his life.''

James seemed at once somber and surprised, his eyes narrowing dangerously:

{}``Ethan, there's a war going on. What is on your mind?''

Ethan picked up their drinks from Louis' passing tray in mid-air,
and replied:

''Go look after him. Find him. Bring him back.''

James shook his head disapprovingly:

{}``A fool's errand. Even if he's alive, it could get you killed.
The both of you.''

{}``It's not an errand and I'm no fool either, I'm a scot. From my
mother's side.'' 

James stare had begun to pierce through Ethan's eyes, casting a gaze
hard as stone upon him: {}``You must be out of your mind,'' he said
in a hushed voice.

Ethan shrugged indifferently and retorted:

{}``I've done more than my fair share of mistakes. I know this isn't
one.''

James voice had a slow quality about it that showed his determination:

{}``You'll need all the help you can get then. If it's going to have
any meaning or chance of success.''

Ethan cracked a smile and drank a tiny sip of Littlemill, noticing
he was almost out of scotch. Louis then appeared out of nowhere with
the grace of a dancer. He offered them the bottle of Littlemill he
had opened earlier. There was barely enough scotch in it for just
another drink. 

{}``Gentlemen, compliments of the house. And you can keep the bottle
too, if you like.''

Ethan nodded his thanks and laughed despite himself, while James still
sat there looking at Ethan seemingly unable to discern whether or
not the man was simply drunk and already grieving, making up ideas.
He asked Ethan, the stress in his voice showing he wanted to be convinced:

{}``You are sure you are going to do this? I want to help. But I
want to know I'm not risking my neck for some jungle antiques, Ethan
Whittmore. And it could mean my neck, literally. I need you to be
deadly serious. All the way.''

Ethan's reply was as sharp as his pervasive eyes:

{}``I got nothing left apart from Andy. Nothing that matters anyway.
Job's shit nowdays. No wife or kids. He's all I got, James.''

James shrugged, his large set of shoulders tensing up his fatigues
almost to the point of tearing. He then told Ethan:

{}``He could be already dead, you know that. He might be a white
English doctor, but no matter how useful he may prove to any captor,
bullets are not very picky.''

Ethan went on, his fists clenching instinctively, his eyes shining
with a crystal clarity that he rarely exhibited:

{}``Then I'll bring back the body to Glasgow and lay him down in
the ground. I'll do what I can, James. I'll do anything.''

James fixed his stare on Ethan, as if he was measuring him up:

{}``What are you going to do? Quit first thing tomorrow?''

Ethan smiled bitterly and said:

{}``Maybe I should. They wouldn't let me though. Operational needs,
lack of personnel, that sort of thing. The service wants to fuck you
three ways to Australia if they can. Can't even put in for leave,
not at such a short notice. Listen, do you think you could arrange
some sort of training exercise? Any reason that will demand me being
attached to somewhere outside Lagos. Gone for a week or two. If all
goes well, then I'll see what I'll do. If not, it won't really matter
from then on.''

James took a mouthful of Littlemill without preparing himself. Unaccustomed
to strong liquor as he was, he looked as if he was about to vomit
on the spot but he managed to contain himself. He shook his head in
affirmation and said:

{}``I can do that. I can do more than that. I can keep you informed;
give you locations, rumors, troop movements, any intelligence that
passes through me. Anything that would help you find your brother
and keep you alive at the same time. I even think I can cook up a
`real' operation. We can then use regular radio traffic to keep in
contact without suspicion.''

{}``Can you do that? I'll need to leave as soon as possible. Tomorrow
night, the day after tomorrow at the latest. I have to pack my gear,
and maybe borrow a couple of things as well, with your help. Then
I need to do some itinerary checking.''

{}``Are you planning to follow the same path as your brother's caravan?''

{}``Yes, all the way. I'll start from Lagos, to Benin City, then
Asaba, through Onitsha and into Biafran territory. From then on, it's
Owerri.''

James nodded appreciatively. He asked with a hint of worry in his
voice:

{}``What happens when you're in Biafra? What happens if you find
your brother?''

{}``You mean when I find Andy. Bring him back, what else?''

{}``I mean, how do you plan to do that? What if he's injured? A prisoner,
or a hostage? What if he's weak, wounded or sick? Don't tell me you'll
hitch a ride back or carry him yourself if you have to.''

{}``I will if I have to.''

{}``Are all scots on their mother's side as foolish as you? I'll
bring a helicopter. We can arrange a landing zone through the radio.
If we lose contact, we'll have two pre-determined LZs, at two different
times. I hope it doesn't get to that.''

{}``You'll do that?''

{}``Helicopters fly without flight plans all the time. I don't have
pilot wings for show, Ethan.''

Ethan grinned at the hint of mischief. James landed him abruptly once
more though:

{}``What are you going to do when you're inside Biafra though? How
are you going to run around, an Englishman like you, with no papers
whatsoever? Or are you just going to let everyone know you're a military
advisor for the Nigerians, so they can perhaps torture you before
shooting you on the spot?''

Ethan seemed a little skeptical, but at length he managed a reply:

{}``I have something in mind for that. I may have a contact, through
the embassy. An old friend. He might be able to forge some papers,
make me look legitimate. A photographer, or a journalist. Someone
who can get in and out with relative impunity.''

{}``There's no such thing as impunity. Tolerance maybe. A journalist
would be a good cover; they're always looking for sympathy from the
press.''

Ethan nodded in agreement and paused toughtfully for a few moments.
He then looked at James as if he knew he was already asking too much
of his Nigerian friend, but nevertheless went on and told him:

{}``James, you've been a good friend while I'm here, helping me ease
into the situation. We're like-minded, you are a damned good professional
if I've ever seen one, your cooking's great but why are you doing
this for me? It can't be that you're risking so much at such a time
just to help a white man from Scotland. I consider you a comrade-in-arms,
a friend I wish I can drool with over a bottle of scotch when I'm
hopefully old enough to pee on my pants. But tell me, why exactly
are you risking your life and career? If it's about money, I assure
you I ..''

James slapped Ethan hard across the face, the shock from the hit leaving
him dazzled for a while. His voice was like gravel on a tin, his face
trembling with aggravation:

{}``You insult me. I come to you as a friend, and you insult me thinking
me a gold-digger. You have a knack, all the Englishmen seem to. You're
so blind to what really is right in front of you. I consider you a
friend too, so I'll consider this a slip of the tongue. You're under
emotional pressure, you've had some drinks. I'll forget you ever said
it.''

James exhaled deeply and seemed to calm down. The timbre of his voice
turned to something affable, a voice unusually soft and mellow, full
of memory and sentiment:

{}``You want to know why I want to help you with whatever means at
my disposal? Because I myself had a brother once. A brother who bled
his hands so I could grow into the man I am today. A brother who buried
our parents with his own hands. I lost that brother. I lost Enkele.
I lost him and while I could have done something about it, I simply
watched him go away, never to return. I've been in your place Ethan.
I know you're doing what I should have done years ago. And I want
you to find your brother. That, I swear unto God.''

Ethan looked sullen and embarassed. He cleared his throat before saying:

{}``I'm sorry James. I'm sorry I offended you. You've never told
me much about him.''

James laughed mirthlessly before replying:

{}``What is there to say, Ethan? Perhaps it was his fate. Like we
have ours.''

{}``You believe in fate, then? Think all this is part of it?'' 

{}``It doesn't matter if I believe. No-one can escape the webs of
fate, believer or not. We should do well to remember that.''

Ethan emptied the rest of his glass in one go, and pour what little
was left in the bottle of Littlemill to the both of them. He then
raised his glass in a toast:

{}``To Andy.''

And James replied:

{}``To Enkele.''

The British embassy in Lagos stood out as the typical colonial building
of the Africas, resplendent and austere, an indubitable legacy from
the golden years of the Empire. Its tall, thin windows shone with
the brightness of the noon sun when Ethan walked through the front
gate saluting the guard on duty only perfunctorily. He ran straight
up the stairs to the 2nd floor, simply ignoring any and all who tried
to be of assistance. The door of the Director of Cultural Affairs
office was half-open. Ethan knocked briskly and entered without waiting
for an answer.

Once inside, he saw a man in his late fifties, short and miniscule.
The man wore a thick mustache, had an almost completely bald scalp
and a pair of old-fashioned ebony-rimmed glasses. The label on his
desk read `Isidor Bloom - Director of Cultural Affairs'. He looked
up from his seemingly casual reading material and immediately popped
a smile. Even though they had only occassionally met at a couple of
Embassy dinners, he offered his hand in a lively, warm way and said:

{}``How do you do? Jolly good I hope, old friend. Please, do have
a seat. Now, what was it that you wanted to speak to me about? I believe
on the phone you said it was an urgent personal matter that somehow
involved my desk. Would you care to elaborate? I can only be of real
help if I know what we're dealing with here, dear fellow. In the strictest
of confidence, of course.''

Ethan shook the hand but still felt somehow a little out of depth,
his inherent distrust of spies kicking in despite the man's cordial
manner. Unaccustomed to protocol and etiquette, Ethan dived straight
into the matter and said bluntly:

{}``Mr. Bloom, I need a cover.''

Isidor Bloom blinked once or twice with an unwavering, somewhat unnatural
smile, and seemingly quite baffled, replied:

{}``I beg your pardon, what kind of cover are you talking about Mr.
Whittmore?''

Before Ethan had time to elaborate, Mr. Bloom had furrowed his brow,
waving a `no-no' finger at Ethan. He got up from his chair and leisurely
closed the door of his office. Ethan could only frown with genuine
puzzlement while Mr. Bloom sat down again comfortably, lit his smoking
pipe and had a puff. He then asked Ethan while looking him directly
in the eye, his gaze strangely unnerving:

{}``Do you ask for a cunt when walking into a brothel, Mr. Whittmore?
In such delicate matters, a little more room for maneuver is usually
required. You'd ask for a girl or a woman, perhaps even some company.
Not for a cunt, which what brothels have on offer. Are you following
me, son?''

Ethan looked ever more perplexed, especially by the sudden change
of mood in the middle-aged man. He understood he had been too blunt,
but while trying to think what to say next and especially how to apologise,
the public servant leaned closer to Ethan before continuing:

{}``Listen, old chap; everybody knows what we're doing here and everyone,
including us, knows we're just doing pottery and traditional art exhibitions.
On Thursdays there's a bagpipe night, though. Savvy?''

Ethan nodded numbly despite not actually understanding all too well
what the man was trying to get at. Mr. Bloom saw the confusion written
on Ethan's face and after sighing slightly, continued:

{}``Right. Well then, let's make things easier for you, and expediate
the process. Is there someone I can call on your behalf? Someone who
can help me, help you?''

At that, Ethan replied automatically, as if he had been waiting for
that question for some time:

{}``Yes, sir. That would be Ian Ruthers, a personal friend.''

As suddenly as before, Mr. Bloom's attitude switched back to his jovial,
well-mannered and quite expedient self. Wearing an almost disconcertingly
wide grin on his face, he picked up the phone on his desk, dialed
a single number, and said:

{}``Hello? Jenny? Put me through to Bristol. Yes, yes, definitely.''

A small wait ensued, which was reason enough for Ethan to start sweating
even though the temperature inside the room was quite pleasant. Mr.
Bloom kept smiling and nodding in a reassuring fashion, which only
accentuated the weird stressful feeling anxiety that had overcome
Ethan. Mr. Bloom was then heard talking over the phone:

{}``Hello? Leonard? Yes, it's me Isidor. Long time no see, but it's
business again I'm afraid. Is Ruthers one of yours? I see. Is he hot
right now? No? Ah, splendid. Could you tell him to give me a call
please? Yes, my office. Well, right about now would be indeed a perfect
time. I'd like to get on with this before lunch. Yes, well she's fine,
working on her garden and all that. How's Marie? Loved her cherry
pie last Christmas, marvellous stuff really. Would love to, old chap.
Have your man call me, alright then? Goodbye Leonard, don't forget
to give my regards. Goodbye.''

Once he hang up the phone, Mr. Bloom surprised Ethan once again with
his choice of words:

{}``Fucking cunt can sod off. Now, let's clear up a few things: This
friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod off as well. If he's going to push
something for me down my pipe, that's fine and all. I don't give fuckall
about the why or how. Do you understand that? I'm going home to Cheltenham
before Christmas, and this desk can rot on my piss. And just so that
you know, the cock around here tastes awful so brush often and have
a care with that mouth of yours.''

Mr. Bloom put out his pipe, placed it in his shirt pocket, picked
up his hat and strolled out of his office, careful to smoothly close
the door behind him.

Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly had
transpired. The only certainty was that Mr. Bloom had probably been
for too long in the service. Ethan's thoughts were interrupted by
the phone ringing. Hesitating at first but then thinking it should
be Ruthers on the other end of the phone line, Ethan picked up the
receiver:

{}``Hello? Ian? It's Ethan Whittmore. Well, what can I say? Didn't
expect to hear me on this end, did you? What am I doing here? Well,
first of all -- yes, I know I'm terrible. No, it wasn't -- I know
I shouldn't be even talking to you like this but I need some help,
Ian. No! I'm not married. Can you be serious for a minute? How you're
working for Six I'll never understand. Well, now that I saw the guy
in the Nigerian desk perhaps I do understand. Listen. Just listen.
I need some cover. It's Andy, my brother. I need to go into Biafra.
No joke. There will be no widow to comfort, so stop being a cunt and
help me over here. Right, then. A piece of paper? I'm on it.''

James rolled a cigarette. Real imported tobacco, confiscated from
Customs. A smile, a joke and a tap in the back usually go a long way.
Especially when you're six feet tall and slightly less stocky than
a bull. That was something that Ethan had said when they had first
met. A piece of wisdom from Britain's finest.

He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen table.
A hefty fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly serrated
set of tiny teeth. The smell of roast dominated the room and through
an open window the grill on the small porch could be seen; a few coals
were settling down, their heat meaningless in the suffocating summer
night of Lagos.

A wedding feast was being held down the next street, the gathered
crowd milling about like a colourful circus troupe, dancing and singing
with vigor despite everyone being thoroughly drenched in sweat. James
peered mirthlessly at the small spectacle and stared blankly for a
minute or two, as if his thoughts were completely disconnected with
what was going on in front of him.

The crowd brought the groom to the fore, the improptu stage the middle
of the street, and made a circle around him. He was all dressed up,
smiling brightly. Everyone showered him with flowers and small gifts,
while they danced to a deep, rhythmic beat of drums. His face seemed
to shine almost imperceptibly with a gold sheen that somehow looked
only natural under the light of the torches.

The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James' arm. He shook instinctively,
ash marking the spot of the slight burn on his skin. His face didn't
flinch though, nor did he seem to notice his cigarette was out. The
phone in the bedroom was ringing with a mindless persistence that
only a salesman would envy.

When James finally got up from his chair, the phone was ringing again.
He stormed outside dressed in nothing but his shorts and ran towards
the moving wedding feast barefooted. As he ran, he ran his tongue
across his lips but couldn't tell his tears from his sweat.


\chapter{Well met on an ill road}

{}``Hello, Richard Owls. London Times. I presume you must be Dr.
Ludwig Manteuffel. Glad you could take me in on such a short notice.''

A somewhat plumb, blond-haired man with a scruffy look and a thin,
wiry receding hair line looked up from his writing pad through thick
glasses and saw a red-haired, tall and almost gaunt man smiling and
squinting under the uncomfortably radiant morning sun:

{}``There's room for more, actually. Your editor-in-chief was very
pleasant on the phone, and quite convincing.''

Ethan laughed politely and replied, tilting his head only barely so
he could shade his eyes at least:

{}``He's a wily bastard, I'll say. When he can tell his arse from
his elbow that is.''

The doctor extended his hand casually and smiled, a bit puzzled:

{}``I hope he's not exhibiting a cognitive disfunction of such proportions.
It could prove quite problematic in his line of work.''

Ethan shook the doctor's hand with some hesitation, shaking his head
in ignorance:

{}``I can't say I'm quite following you, doctor.''

Dr. Manteuffel wiped the sweat on his forehead with the arm holding
the writing pad and exhaled briskly with the hint of a slight laugh:

{}``Distasteful doctor's humor, Mr. Owls. Can I call you Richard?
Please call me Ludwig, we'll be on the road together for some time.
This isn't exactly a dinner party we're going to, yes?''

A number of people around them was busy loading the Land Rovers with
all sorts of crates, bags, and sacks with everything from gauzes to
canned food and flour. Ethan looked quite accustomed to the heat and
the Nigerian sun, at odds with the stocky german doctor who seemed
to be discomforted immensely, even though he tried his best not to
show it. Ethan nodded with a sparkly grin and said:

{}``Can't see any drinks on offer, and the timing's off too. Ludwig,
then?''

The german doctor motioned with his pad to the paltry shade offered
by a nearby tent filled with crates stamped with the sign of the Red
Cross, and Ethan lead eagerly. The doctor replied:

{}``You can also call me Baron. It's a nickname my colleagues often
use, jokingly of course.''

{}``No real title then?''

{}``Oh, the family name is old and at some point there was some land
associated with it. The land was sold but the title stuck. The war,
you see.''

Ethan put down his knapsack and welcomed the shade, settling on a
crate. His eyes seemed suddenly old, staring outside at the crowd
of volunteers when he said:

{}``There's always some kind of war going on. Isn't that why you're
here now?''

The doctor put down his pad on one of the crates, pulled a fold-up
chair from a corner of the tent, spread it open and sat down, his
relief obvious in the way he splayed his feed, heels on the dirt.
He took a few short breaths before answering in a peculiar, thoughtful
voice:

{}``I'm here to help in what way I can. Famine and disease are just
as lethal as bullets from what I've seen. But why are you here?''

Ethan frowned in puzzlement and smiled in his usually disarming way.
He tried to sound casually baffled when he said:

{}``Tell the world what's going on in Biafra. Take some pictures.
Perhaps ask London for a raise too once I'm famous.''

The doctor put one leg on the other and seemed somewhat distraught,
perhaps worried:

{}``So, a professional. I was hoping for a bit of a romantic you
see. Every help we can get is better than none at all. And frankly,
you don't look like the kind of journalist that just stays at the
typewriter all day long.''

Ethan crossed his arms against his chest, purely an instinctive defensive
motion that only helped to show his nervousness. His charm didn't
seem to work as intended, and his sly grin was his way of showing
he genuinely liked the plumb Prussian doctor for his openness:

{}``What kind of journalist do I look like then?''

The doctor reached into his sweat-stained shirt's pocket and procured
a pack of Camel's. He put one into his mouth and proferred one to
Ethan as well, who politely nodded his refusal, the grin unwaveringly
attached on his tanned face. The doctor got up from his seat, while
searching around for something to light his cigarette, while replying
in a slightly muffled voice:

{}``The kind I'm thinking I don't want to know more about. Light?''

Ethan laughed and felt somewhat unburdened. He offered Dr. Manteufel
a lighter from one of his pants' side pockets:

{}``I can't really say what's in your mind, Ludwig.''

The doctor lit his Camel and seemed to cherish the moment before answering,
his eyes squarely meeting Ethan's gaze before asking him straight:

{}``Are you going to be trouble? We don't need any more trouble where
we're going.''

Ethan took his lighter back and answered the doctor, the sudden quietness
in his voice the only indication that he himself was somewhat uncertain:

{}``I want to stay out of it as much as you do.''

Ludwig drew on his cigarette once more, this time exhaling briskly
and adding hastily:

{}``Good. That's good. Thank you.''

Ethan sounded a bit embarassed when he then said:

{}``Look, I know how this must look, but it's not what you might
be thinking. I'm not a spy or a mercenary or anything in between.
It's something personal, it's about -''

{}``I don't want to know Richard, or whoever you really are. Let's
just pretend, alright?''

Ethan was at a loss with the doctor's honest and direct manner. It
felt refreshing, almost liberating in a sense. He nodded silently
before the doctor went on:

{}``I just want to help these people, and stay alive in the process.
Is it too much to ask?''

{}``No, I suppose it's not.''

Ludwig then put out his cigarette in the dirt and wiped his forehead
once more before telling Ethan:

{}``Good man. A good man.''

Ethan asked Ludwig with a voice that seemed right on the edge of doubt:

{}``How can you tell?''

Ludwig looked at him with some reluctance before replying:

{}``I can't. But I have hope.''
