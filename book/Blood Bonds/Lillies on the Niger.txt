“There is a house in New Orleans, they call it the Rising Sun”

- The Animals, The House of The Rising Sun






In her Majesty's service

Sweat ran freely down the red-haired Englishman's temples, 
smearing the jungle camo on his clean-shaven face. A knife blade 
covered in dry mud sat in his left hand, while his other hand 
made a rough circle in the air. It was a hand signal for the 
command to encircle the target.

Five men melted away into the green humid jungle in a heartbeat, 
as if they had been an optical illusion. They moved fast; faster 
than what Ethan had believed them capable of. He decided to stand 
back for a little while more, and see how they could handle their 
approach on their own.

All of them stopped dead in their tracks and hunched low when 
they heard noise, probably from the direction of the clearing up 
ahead. The two men that formed the edge of the squad aimed their 
rifles outwards from the squad, as if a switch had been thrown. 
The point man laid himself flat with the silken grace of a cat, 
knife drawn in his right hand while his left hand reached out for 
his Colt zero-point-forty-five. The rearguard moved like a pair 
of dancers, covering each other's back, both aiming their rifles 
from shoulder-high, safeties clicked off to single-shot 
selection.

In that cautious small diamond formation they moved as a whole, 
each step forward made with practiced ease and well-earned 
confidence, the mark of a well-trained soldier. For all intends 
and purposes, and as far as Ethan was concerned, he had done a 
good job training them. What did bother him though was that they 
had yet to fire a shot in anger. He knew that nothing tests a man 
like real combat.

Though they moved precisely as they had been taught, and seemed 
quick and stealthy enough, Ethan couldn't really tell if they 
just went through the motions or if they were really up for the 
challenge. After all, no matter how much one practices before a 
show, it's the opening night that makes or breaks it.

Ethan's free hand was wrapped tightly around a metal L-shaped 
trigger attached to a small box no larger than a pack of 
cigarettes, from which a run of cables protruded and got lost 
somewhere under the rich jungle tapestrie of green and brown. 
With a tight grin, Ethan whispered to himself with the 
expectation of a job well done:

“Showtime, lads.”

When he double-clicked the trigger the first thing that attracted 
everyone's attention were the flashes. And then came the 
shockwaves, their force pummeling at everyone, making every 
ribcage vibrate intensely as if tremors had seized them. And that 
was just the opening note.

Small gun fire erupted from various well-placed locations, the 
muzzle flashes dotting the lavish scenery as if hundreds of 
photographers clicked in rapid succession.

The scouts instantly dived for cover, falling prone while keeping 
their arcs of fire fimly fixed to their own particular zone of 
responsibility. A wry smile formed on Ethan's face: he seemed to 
be enjoying the performance.

The five trainees were on their bellies, rolling and crawling 
over the jungle bed in an effort to find as much cover as 
possible in mere moments. They exchanged quick glances and made 
repetitive hand motions to each other, communicating silently 
trying to establish a point where they could fall back away from 
the guns blazing at them.

Every tree trunk and low bush or gully counted for gold at times 
like these, and the five Marine scouts from the 3rd Marine 
division made excellent use of their surroundings. Very much so 
that Ethan felt a twang of pride at seeing his handiwork in 
action. They were his men, and they seemed every bit as 
professional as he intended them to be.

They quickly abandoned their exposed position for a slightly 
shallow depression with good cover, fat tree trunks strewn around 
them with thick bush for cover and a clear view on all sides. A 
defendable position from which they could easily spot a move 
against them and fall back while they harassed their enemy firing 
and moving in turns. Ethan's mind flashed with the sudden 
realisation they were good enough to be Royal Marine scouts, not 
just Nigerian troops.

He almost felt a hint of regret he couldn't be there with them 
when it really mattered, when the guns pointing towards them were 
not loaded with blanks; when the explosive charges half a mile 
away were real shells and mortars falling right on them. 

Almost, as Ethan reminded himself inside his head, was the 
eminent keyword: This was not his war, not by a far chance, and 
setting up mock engagements such as this one was as close as he 
wanted to get to another warzone. Except for the times when he 
itched, except for the times he woke up in the middle of the 
night drenched in sweat, knowing it wasn't the tropical heat that 
left him sleepless thereafter, but faces all too well remembered 
and defined.

The team of five men had dug themselves in taking solid cover. 
The gunfire died down soon afterwards, and Ethan believed there 
was no point in continuing tracking and crossing the jungle. He 
had seen what he wanted to see, and that was a team of scouts, 
not a bunch of gung-ho Nigerians hollering with rifles raised 
firing on auto, vying for Igbo blood.

Ethan raised himself above the brushes and bellowed as if he 
wanted the cadets back at Sandhurst to hear him clear as rain:

“End of session! Fine job lads!”

The team of five gave no sign of sight or sound that they had 
heard their instructor. Ethan repeated himself with less 
enthusiasm:

“Come on, games' over! Let's head back for some rest, off we go.”

Still, nothing could be now heard other than the usual sounds of 
the jungle, the distant cries of birds and monkeys, and the 
constant buzzing of mosquitoes and other assorted exotic insects.

Ethan furrowed his brow and briefly considered that the team 
might have actually extracted themselves without him noticing, 
and decided to check the small depression himself. With a hurried 
pace, he made his way through the brush and in a few moments 
reached the position he had last seen them take cover in.

He saw noone, but suddenly felt a piece of metal poking him 
through his left side, right between his ribs, poised to pierce 
his heart at a single thrust. He had been caught unawares, and 
once he looked sideways to his assailant, he saw Onko, the team 
scout leader smiling wildly, his bright white teeth a stark 
contrast to his camouflaged dark face. A little stunned and a 
little bit surprised, Ethan barely had time to let off a curse:

“Bugger me, you've grown into a real scout Idowu.”

No longer wearing the same disarming smile, the nigerian marine 
responded with a heavy accent, the nigerian pronunciation thick 
and strong:

“You grow soft, Captain Whittmore.”

Onko then sheathed his knife, and the four other men suddenly 
appeared from quite unlikely and widespread places, from any one 
of which they could have put a bullet through Ethan at their 
leisure.

Ethan nodded and made a small sigh, as if acknowledging he had 
indeed let his guard down and been overcome, exactly what he 
tought his recruits should never happen, not even while not in 
the battlefield. Cultivating a little paranoia went a long way in 
keeping a man alive, especially in a civil war where telling a 
friend from an enemy was not as clean a business as shooting at 
one.

Ethan did manage to save some face though when he pointed at his 
feet to a small bump in the ground, leaves cluttered all over it 
and said:

“See now Ibrahim, that's a mark for a landmine. You might have 
killed at least one man when you chose to fall back here.”

Onko seemed far from smiling at that comment, and with a mixed 
expression midpoint between anger and disappointment he said to 
Ethan, making it sound almost like an accusation:

“There was no place else to fall back and cover, Captain. It was 
a death trap then, for sure. What could we have done different? 
Not fair, sir.”

The word `sir' had a strange ring to it, and that probably was 
because it was meant to sound off-putting. Ethan only cared to 
answer briefly right before he turned about and started walking 
to the gathering area of the training field:

“All's fair in love and war, sergeant. Says so somewhere, I'm 
pretty sure of that.”

In the warm light of neon orange, Ethan searched his pockets for 
the some small change, but to no avail. He rarely needed dimes 
and pennies when he made his cosmopolitan visits to the center of 
Lagos, but using the jukebox in Loui's bar was such an occasion, 
and even more so a favourite habit.

In fact, Ethan was not a rare visitor to Loui's establishment, 
and most would instantly recognise him. He was widely known as 
the Englishman, both to the few locals and the numerous 
extraordinary foreigners that frequented the Metropolitaine.

Ethan maintained that he only came for the regularly up-to-date 
jukebox, whilst his tab indicated a thirsty sort of music lover 
with a certain taste for fine malts.

Malts such as the unusually fine scotch that Loui kept stashed 
for the well-off or even well-liked customer. He had simply 
decided to thank God there was good scotch to be found in a place 
like Nigeria and even more so in a bar like Loui's. To make the 
realisation even more mind-numbing for Ethan, there was good 
scotch to be found during what the Nigerian government chose to 
characterise as a `crisis'. The Metropolitaine's crude and shanty 
decoration, or more appropriately its blatant lack thereof only 
helped to somehow accentuate that a war was going on.

A couple of ceiling fans still worked despite what one might 
expect at first sight, barely keeping the air from going stale.

It was with his usual wide grin that Louis, the proprietor, 
approached Ethan and offered him a penny before bowing slightly, 
impeccably dressed in a striped jacket, white pressed shirt, 
bowtie and smart pants, an air of the thirties Paris about him. 
Ethan accepted the coin gladly and immediately dropped it in the 
slot, while Louis chimed in his blatantly french but not 
unbearable accent:

“Compliments of the house, Capitain. The usual? Little ice, 
double fine scotch?”

Ethan smiled wryly and nodded while selecting a song in the 
jukebox, his index finger searching for the correct button to 
press. He pushed `Under my thumb', and turned to reply to Louis 
before setting off to settle in his usual barstool, the bar 
solely at his disposal at that hour:

“Very fine scotch.”

“Nothing but Scotland's finest, Mr. Whittmore.”

Ethan sat on the barstool, his eyes staring at the glasses and 
various bottles of liquor neatly arrayed and featuring 
prominently in the shelves behind the bar. When he next spoke, it 
was with a feeling of relief:

“I'd never thought I'd say this, but God bless Nigeria.”

Louis had assumed his proper place behind the bar when he picked 
up a bottle of one of his finest malts from a cupboard below 
along with a short glass, and said smiling wryly while he poured:

“I'm from Guiana though.”

“Ah, and Scotch is from Scotland but it knows no borders. Come on 
then, pour one yourself.”

The unusually tall, lank bartender complied and picked up a shot 
glass which he filled promptly and raised to a toast:

“To all the thirsty men.”

The Rolling Stones song had started playing in the background. 
Ethan raised his own glass of scotch and made a toast as well:

“To Mick Jagger and crew.”

They both gulped down their drinks in one go. Ethan made a slight 
motion with one hand, indicating the cupboard below.

Louis went through the motions of pouring another glass of scotch 
and asked his regular customer for the past year or so with his 
usual air of cool affection:

“How's life treating you?”

Ethan's tone was lighthearted, almost flippant when he said:

“Not sure. Better than horseshit? I'm not complaining though. 
Still 'ere, aren't I?”

Louis laughed politely and nodded before replying:

“Woe be me if something should happen to you. Losing customers, I 
cannot afford that?”

“You're not losing me soon enough. Keep the scotch coming, and 
I'll manage.”

Louis let the glass of scotch slide across the wooden bar and 
looked Ethan straight in the eye, his face almost a pale shade of 
dark under the dim candlelight surrounding the bar:

“What news from your friends in high places?”

Ethan shook his head and made a strange, sour face for a moment. 
He brought the glass to his lips, sniffing the aromas:

“Nothing yet. It's not easy, you knew that. Not to mention 
there's money involved. But it'll take time Louis. Your visa 
isn't exactly top priority.”

Louis shook his head in disappointment, and started polishing a 
basket full of washed glasses. His eyes were fixed to the task at 
hand when he replied to Ethan with a mixed feeling of sadness and 
slight aggravation, his movements lacking his usual crispness and 
finesse:

“You said by the end of the month, Englishman. Said you knew the 
`ins and outs', didn't you? Who will keep Insami and Wadu off my 
back, I wonder. Make it top priority, can you?”

Ethan kept wearing the same smile that had won him arguments on 
innumerable occasions, while he kept tapping his fingers to the 
rhythm of the song playing from the jukebox. After a short 
uncomfortable silence, he said to Louis:

“It must feel like a kick in the nuts, Louis, but remember, I'm 
doing you a favor. Take a look around you. There's bigger trouble 
than those two thugs. There's a war going on. If they do pop up 
and act like a couple of tough guvs, I'll make sure they get one 
in the sack and lose a couple of teeth each. No use worrying 
about it now.”

Louis looked a bit distraught, his eyes somewhat dull from 
wariness. Ethan tried to change the subject:

”What do you have for me this time? Auchentoshan? Glenfiddich? ”

Louis became his professional self again; he seemed to relax a 
bit, his tense mouth loosening into a tight smile. He reached for 
a tall cupboard with a lock on the handles, and used a small key 
that hung from a chain around his neck. He opened the cupboard 
with small, graceful movements of his hands, as if opening an 
icon or a shrine. In it, a dozen bottles of Littlemill sat, dusty 
and squat, seemingly quite authentic seal, cork and all. At the 
sight of the bottles of scotch and the prospect of savouring them 
at his leisure, Ethan's face lit up and his blue eyes seemed for 
a moment to sparkle. His voice couldn't contain his enthusiasm:

“Littlemill? Thirty-two years old, triple distillation. Bugger 
me, oldest malt in Scotland. Let me see that bottle.”

Louis complied even though anyone could tell from his face he was 
quite puzzled. Ethan was usually interested in the contents, not 
the labels.

“Here you go, englishman.”

Ethan completely disregarded the bartender's effort at a 
light-hearted insult and studied the bottle's labels with focused 
interest. At length, he nodded appreciatively before adding:

”From Ayrshire, too.”

Loui asked with real curiosity while opening the bottle of 
Littlemill Ethan was still clutching like a scepter:

“Is that the place for the best scotch?”

Ethan let go of the bottle and while Louis put a single cube of 
ice in Ethan's glass, he continued, his expression emanating a 
scholarly aura:

“'Tis the ancestral birthplace of the greatest scot that ever 
lived. William Wallace.”

The name of the famous scottish hero was intoned with reverence 
and pride. It seemed to have no effect on the Guinean bartender 
who casually asked:

“Who is he?”

Ethan blinked twice and was taken slightly aback when the name of 
the greatest Scotsman that ever lived rang no bell. He 
nevertheless straightened his back and breathed deeply when he 
tried to explain to Loui.

“William Wallace fought the English for the freedom of Scotland 
for over a dozen years. They killed his wife and family and in 
the end he was betrayed. He gave his all, William Wallace. 
Biggest set of stones ever.”

Loui looked at Ethan in puzzlement as he uncorked the fine 
scotch, its smoky aroma wafting upwards, arousing the senses. His 
question seemed to flatten Ethan's face right at the moment his 
nostrils had become so excited:

“But Scotland isn't free. You serve the Queen of England.”

“That's not entirely true, I serve the Queen of the United 
Kingdom.”

“But there's no Queen of the Scots, is there?”

“She's also Queen of the Scots. And the Welsh. And the Irish. 
Well, at least some of the Irish.”

“See, that's not unlike the situation here in Nigeria. The Igbo 
are like the Scots, they want to be free. Shouldn't they be free?”

“I don't have a say in that. It's not my job, and it's not my 
people. If they can, they will. And if you want to know, my 
father might have been born in Glasgow but I grew up in 
Kensington, so piss off with the Scots and all that. Pour, for 
the love of God.”

Louis smiled wryly before he retorted:

“You brought it up, Captain.”

Ethan was starting to get properly wound up when the door bell 
rang and attracted his attention. He looked up from his drink and 
saw Louis pointing with his long bony index finger to a sturdy, 
tall and fit black man dressed in fatigues, the beret of the 
Nigerian Marine Corps smartly adorning his head. The man's eyes 
peered vehemently through the haze and fog of the smoke and dust 
that seemed to always twirl lazily in the Metropolitaine.

The soldier's gaze quickly settled on Ethan, who was spinning 
around on his barstool to look at the newcomer directly. He 
cracked a smile and gave a mocking half-salute to the burly man 
who - judging by his epaulets - appeared to be a brevet Major. 
The man did not seem to share the same good humor and did not 
salute, neither did he seem to enjoy smiles and levity a lot. As 
he approached the bar, Ethan's mood had swung again towards his 
sweet side and he cheerfully made a gesture at the still open 
cupboard full of Littlemill, greeting the man with a proposition:

“James, this is a once in a lifetime chance for a once in a 
lifetime experience. It's Littlemill. It's the nectar of the 
Gods. It'll be monumental James; getting plastered with the 
finest scotch in the whole country, with little doubt. So, what 
is the unhappy occassion of your visit here in uniform? Tell me 
all about it so I can forget it with the help of Louis and 
Littlemill. Is it remotely serious? Are the Biafrans hurtling 
shells at Lagos? Can I go home now?”

The heavily set man had a quite intimidating appearance. The 
capability of severely wounding a man armed with nothing but his 
hands was the usual first impression. At odds with his brutal 
image he had a strangely calm and serene demeanor, a grim look on 
his face that implied his mind was occupied with grave matters. 
He approached Ethan and taking off his beret he calmly said:

“It's your brother, Ethan. We have reports their caravan was 
probably attacked today. Somewhere in the jungle near the border. 
They never reached Owerri.”

Ethan's smile evaporated. He suddenly looked somber and 
withdrawn. The news were a mood killer to say the least. He 
looked at James with wary, stern eyes:

“Red Cross is supposed to have Army support. Where was their 
support, James?”

James' bulky shoulders shook with a disarmingly vulnerable shrug. 
He embraced Ethan with a single arm and told him in a friendly, 
casual manner:

“Let's have a drink, Ethan. Let's talk.”

[vphantom:]

* * *

[vphantom:]

Business in the Metropolitaine was in full swing. A small gang of 
sailors were celebrating one of their mates birthday, following 
the custom of drinking till the botswain comes looking for them. 
Louis kept a wary eye on a couple of strange-looking figures, but 
other than that the orders kept coming in and that made him a 
happy man.

Ethan was sitting opposite James at a small round metal table in 
a corner near the bar, looking far from jovial. What James had 
told him had suddenly turned this war into a personal matter, 
something that every professional soldier tried to avoid. A 
well-known but sadly overlooked factor in dying was doing stupid 
things for all the wrong reasons, and making a war something 
personal was both stupid and wrong.

James had fallen silent for a couple minutes silently sipping at 
his wine, a local plonk variety that barely passed the mark. 
Ethan was down to his last couple of cigarettes, chain-smoking 
ever since they had sat down to talk. At length, Ethan broke the 
uncomfortable silence:

“I should have pulled some strings when he told me he was going 
in with the Red Cross. Red tape, paperwork, passport trouble. 
Surely someone you know in the Interior could have been of some 
help. Maybe forced him to stay in Britain, somehow. Don't know, 
really.”

James motioned a definite `no' with his head, eyes closed shut. 
He then had another sip before answering:

“You know there are many ways to come into Nigeria. If your 
brother wanted to come, he would have found his own. There's 
nothing you could have really done to prevent him from coming 
here in the first place.”

Ethan drew heavily on his cigarette and exhaled briskly. He spoke 
with some irritation:

“True enough, that. Maybe you could have detained him when their 
caravan set off for Biafra? I could have spoken some more sense 
into him. It doesn't matter now, does it?”

James was as calm as before, answering with a flat and 
emotionless voice, trying to calm down Ethan as well:

“Not a Red Cross caravan. How would it look in the papers if 
Nigeria blocked the Red Cross? It would look like we want to let 
children die of dysentery and famine. No, we could not have told 
your brother to just stay put. It was not my job, and not yours 
either. It was his choice, his life.”

Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one 
go and made a gesture with his empty glass to Louis who seemed to 
notice almost immediately. Ethan then looked straight into James' 
eyes; a set of dark eyes accented by the small bit of white that 
surrounded them. He tried to calm himself and find the 
appropriate words:

“You are right about that.. Maybe I should have just whipped him 
good like when we were still ten years old. But he's a grown man, 
a doctor no less. He has his duties, his obligations. Like I have 
my own. Though I still think it was a stupid thing to do, at 
least he acted like the man he's supposed to be. He wanted to 
help, he signed up with the Red Cross. Never really saw meself 
how lying down on the grass all day long, smoking grass and 
fucking like rabbits could stop people from dying. Still, a 
stupid move coming here.”

There was a pause. Louis was returning to their table with 
Ethan's refill of Littlemill and a clean ashtray. Ethan nodded 
his thanks to Louis who in turn bowed slightly and fleeted off to 
serve some other table. James had rested his arms on their table, 
his frame too large to comfortably seat himself in the 
Metropolitaine's plain chairs. Ethan took a mouthful of 
Littlemill and flinched when he felt the malt burn down his 
throat and into his stomach. He then went on:

”I know, war's no place for idealists and romantics. That's 
probably why I'm still alive. That, and an awful amount of luck, 
I'd wager. Maybe Andy's doing a better job than I ever could. I 
mean, in the grander scheme of things, him being a doctor and all 
that. Can't really tell why I didn't stop him. I just couldn't, 
you know?”

James blinked languidly and sipped the last bit of his wine. He 
set his glass down with a clang before replying:

“Someone has to try and save the world. People like your brother 
think they can. Like every hero should.”

James grunted with a hint of disapproval and Ethan grimaced with 
slight annoyance at that contemptive gesture. He lit up one of 
the last cigarettes in his pack and inhaled thoroughly:

“Well, I wouldn't know. I'm not exactly in the business of saving 
people, am I? You could say we're sort of antagonists, me and 
Andy. Kind of reminds me, we used to be in opposite teams when we 
balled.”

“I didn't know you play cricket.”

“Haven't ever since I got a leg injury in Kenya. Nasty business 
that was. Almost got meself killed. Young, stupid and rash. Also, 
quite a lucky bastard.”

James expression seemed to change somewhat. He removed his hands 
from the table and for a moment sat still, looking at Ethan 
intensely. He then ordered another drink from Loui, who seemed to 
keep a watchful eye at their table more so than the others and 
nodded promptly, disappearing at the back for a couple of 
minutes. When James spoke next, he was lighting up Ethan's last 
cigarette, Ethan affording nothing but a stunned surprise and a 
deep furrow:

“Were you any good at it?”

“What, cricket? I thought you didn't smoke.”

“I'm a man of many talents. And some vices as well.”

“Well, I hope you're not a Rolling Stones fan as well. It'd be a 
real crime to find out you've been hiding that too.”

James drew on his cigarette and threw his head back, letting off 
a small cloud of smoke. He was smiling when he pointed to Ethan 
and said:

“Not much to hide, Ethan. Sometimes I smoke. Usually alone.”

Ethan nodded with a sly grin on his face. He sipped another 
mouthful from his glass of scotch which was disappearing fast. 
James was toying with the ice in his glass when a slight grin 
formed on his face, droplets of sweat running down his forehead, 
glistening dimly in the hazy, poor lighting of the 
Metropolitaine:

“A better chance than cricket, true enough. A bad leg won't leave 
you behind.”

“It isn't just the bad leg. I'm not a cricket fan really. Andy 
loves it though. At least as a kid he did. Used to drag me along. 
The bad leg is just a reminder.”

James seemed to stiffen suddenly. He straightened his back before 
reaching for his glass, his voice a bit shallow and distant:

“Which is worse, Ethan? The memories, or the leg?”



“It's the memories alright. Hadn't seen him in four years. Rarely 
called. Never wrote. He must've thought I couldn't care less. But 
it's the job, you know? The distance.”

James interjected mildly:

“The scotch too?”

Ethan drained his glass, as if a real thirst was driving him and 
answered:

“That too.”

James was looking at him through bloodshot eyes, his glass of 
wine empty once more. He sat upright in his chair, drew audibly 
through his large nostrils on the thick air of the Metropolitaine 
and made a hand signal for another round of drinks, making sure 
that Louis brought two glasses of Littlemill. Ethan's gaze was 
fixed on the ceiling fan above them. He looked distantly 
thoughtful, grim and withdrawn, far from his usual self. He 
turned his eyes to his empty glass and spoke with a touch of 
anger behind each sentence:

“I need to find my brother. I've never left a man behind in my 
life. Brought everyone back. I can't leave me own brother behind. 
It's Andy for God's sake, hasn't hurt a fly in his life.”

James seemed at once somber and surprised, his eyes narrowing 
dangerously:

“Ethan, there's a war going on. What is on your mind?”

Ethan picked up their drinks from Louis' passing tray in mid-air, 
and replied:

”Go look after him. Find him. Bring him back.”

James shook his head disapprovingly:

“A fool's errand. Even if he's alive, it could get you killed. 
The both of you.”

“It's not an errand and I'm no fool either, I'm a scot. From my 
mother's side.” 

James stare had begun to pierce through Ethan's eyes, casting a 
gaze hard as stone upon him: “You must be out of your mind,” he 
said in a hushed voice.

Ethan shrugged indifferently and retorted:

“I've done more than my fair share of mistakes. I know this isn't 
one.”

James voice had a slow quality about it that showed his 
determination:

“You'll need all the help you can get then. If it's going to have 
any meaning or chance of success.”

Ethan cracked a smile and drank a tiny sip of Littlemill, 
noticing he was almost out of scotch. Louis then appeared out of 
nowhere with the grace of a dancer. He offered them the bottle of 
Littlemill he had opened earlier. There was barely enough scotch 
in it for just another drink. 

“Gentlemen, compliments of the house. And you can keep the bottle 
too, if you like.”

Ethan nodded his thanks and laughed despite himself, while James 
still sat there looking at Ethan seemingly unable to discern 
whether or not the man was simply drunk and already grieving, 
making up ideas. He asked Ethan, the stress in his voice showing 
he wanted to be convinced:

“You are sure you are going to do this? I want to help. But I 
want to know I'm not risking my neck for some jungle antiques, 
Ethan Whittmore. And it could mean my neck, literally. I need you 
to be deadly serious. All the way.”

Ethan's reply was as sharp as his pervasive eyes:

“I got nothing left apart from Andy. Nothing that matters anyway. 
Job's shit nowdays. No wife or kids. He's all I got, James.”

James shrugged, his large set of shoulders tensing up his 
fatigues almost to the point of tearing. He then told Ethan:

“He could be already dead, you know that. He might be a white 
English doctor, but no matter how useful he may prove to any 
captor, bullets are not very picky.”

Ethan went on, his fists clenching instinctively, his eyes 
shining with a crystal clarity that he rarely exhibited:

“Then I'll bring back the body to Glasgow and lay him down in the 
ground. I'll do what I can, James. I'll do anything.”

James fixed his stare on Ethan, as if he was measuring him up:

“What are you going to do? Quit first thing tomorrow?”

Ethan smiled bitterly and said:

“Maybe I should. They wouldn't let me though. Operational needs, 
lack of personnel, that sort of thing. The service wants to fuck 
you three ways to Australia if they can. Can't even put in for 
leave, not at such a short notice. Listen, do you think you could 
arrange some sort of training exercise? Any reason that will 
demand me being attached to somewhere outside Lagos. Gone for a 
week or two. If all goes well, then I'll see what I'll do. If 
not, it won't really matter from then on.”

James took a mouthful of Littlemill without preparing himself. 
Unaccustomed to strong liquor as he was, he looked as if he was 
about to vomit on the spot but he managed to contain himself. He 
shook his head in affirmation and said:

“I can do that. I can do more than that. I can keep you informed; 
give you locations, rumors, troop movements, any intelligence 
that passes through me. Anything that would help you find your 
brother and keep you alive at the same time. I even think I can 
cook up a `real' operation. We can then use regular radio traffic 
to keep in contact without suspicion.”

“Can you do that? I'll need to leave as soon as possible. 
Tomorrow night, the day after tomorrow at the latest. I have to 
pack my gear, and maybe borrow a couple of things as well, with 
your help. Then I need to do some itinerary checking.”

“Are you planning to follow the same path as your brother's 
caravan?”

“Yes, all the way. I'll start from Lagos, to Benin City, then 
Asaba, through Onitsha and into Biafran territory. From then on, 
it's Owerri.”

James nodded appreciatively. He asked with a hint of worry in his 
voice:

“What happens when you're in Biafra? What happens if you find 
your brother?”

“You mean when I find Andy. Bring him back, what else?”

“I mean, how do you plan to do that? What if he's injured? A 
prisoner, or a hostage? What if he's weak, wounded or sick? Don't 
tell me you'll hitch a ride back or carry him yourself if you 
have to.”

“I will if I have to.”

“Are all scots on their mother's side as foolish as you? I'll 
bring a helicopter. We can arrange a landing zone through the 
radio. If we lose contact, we'll have two pre-determined landing 
zones, at two different times. I hope it doesn't get to that.”

“You'll do that?”

“Helicopters fly without flight plans all the time. I don't have 
pilot wings for show, Ethan.”

Ethan grinned at the hint of mischief. James landed him abruptly 
once more though:

“What are you going to do when you're inside Biafra though? How 
are you going to run around, an Englishman like you, with no 
papers whatsoever? Or are you just going to let everyone know 
you're a military advisor for the Nigerians, so they can perhaps 
torture you before shooting you on the spot?”

Ethan seemed a little skeptical, but at length he managed a 
reply:

“I have something in mind for that. I may have a contact, through 
the embassy. An old friend. He might be able to forge some 
papers, make me look legitimate. A photographer, or a journalist. 
Someone who can get in and out with relative impunity.”

“There's no such thing as impunity. Tolerance maybe. A journalist 
would be a good cover; they're always looking for sympathy from 
the press.”

Ethan nodded in agreement and paused toughtfully for a few 
moments. He then looked at James as if he knew he was already 
asking too much of his Nigerian friend, but nevertheless went on 
and told him:

“James, you've been a good friend while I'm here, helping me ease 
into the situation. We're like-minded, you are a damned good 
professional if I've ever seen one, your cooking's great but why 
are you doing this for me? It can't be that you're risking so 
much at such a time just to help a white man from Scotland. I 
consider you a comrade-in-arms, a friend I wish I can drool with 
over a bottle of scotch when I'm hopefully old enough to pee on 
my pants. But tell me, why exactly are you risking your life and 
career? If it's about money, I assure you I ..”

James slapped Ethan hard across the face, the shock from the hit 
leaving him dazzled for a while. His voice was like gravel on a 
tin, his face trembling with aggravation:

“You insult me. I come to you as a friend, and you insult me 
thinking me a gold-digger. You have a knack, all the Englishmen 
seem to. You're so blind to what really is right in front of you. 
I consider you a friend too, so I'll consider this a slip of the 
tongue. You're under emotional pressure, you've had some drinks. 
I'll forget you ever said it.”

James exhaled deeply and seemed to calm down. The timbre of his 
voice turned to something affable, a voice unusually soft and 
mellow, full of memory and sentiment:

“You want to know why I want to help you with whatever means at 
my disposal? Because I myself had a brother once. A brother who 
bled his hands so I could grow into the man I am today. A brother 
who buried our parents with his own hands. I lost that brother. I 
lost him and while I could have done something about it, I simply 
watched him go away, never to return. I've been in your place 
Ethan. I know you're doing what I should have done years ago. And 
I want you to find your brother. That, I swear unto God.”

Ethan looked sullen and embarassed. He cleared his throat before 
saying:

“I'm sorry James. I'm sorry I offended you. You've never told me 
much about him.”

James laughed without joy before replying:

“What is there to say, Ethan? Perhaps it was his fate. Like we 
have ours.”

“You believe in fate, then? Think all this is part of it?” 

“It doesn't matter if I believe. No-one can escape the webs of 
fate, believer or not. We should do well to remember that.”

Ethan emptied the rest of his glass in one go, and pour what 
little was left in the bottle of Littlemill to the both of them. 
He then raised his glass in a toast:

“To Andy.”

And James replied:

“To Enkele.”

[vphantom:]

The British embassy in Lagos stood out as the typical colonial 
building of the Africas, resplendent and austere, an indubitable 
legacy from the golden years of the Empire. Its tall, thin 
windows shone with the brightness of the noon sun when Ethan 
walked through the front gate saluting the guard on duty only 
perfunctorily. He ran straight up the stairs to the 2nd floor, 
simply ignoring any and all who tried to be of assistance. The 
door of the Director of Cultural Affairs office was half-open. 
Ethan knocked briskly and entered without waiting for an answer.

Once inside, he saw a man in his late fifties, short and 
miniscule. The man wore a thick mustache, had an almost 
completely bald scalp and a pair of old-fashioned ebony-rimmed 
glasses. The label on his desk read `Isidor Bloom - Director of 
Cultural Affairs'. He looked up from his seemingly casual reading 
material and immediately popped a smile. Even though they had 
only occassionally met at a couple of Embassy dinners, he offered 
his hand in a lively, warm way and said:

“How do you do? Jolly good I hope, old friend. Please, do have a 
seat. Now, what was it that you wanted to speak to me about? I 
believe on the phone you said it was an urgent personal matter 
that somehow involved my desk. Would you care to elaborate? I can 
only be of real help if I know what we're dealing with here, dear 
fellow. In the strictest of confidence, of course.”

Ethan shook the hand but still felt somehow a little out of 
depth, his inherent distrust of spies kicking in despite the 
man's cordial manner. Unaccustomed to protocol and etiquette, 
Ethan dived straight into the matter and said bluntly:

“Mr. Bloom, I need a cover.”

Isidor Bloom blinked once or twice with an unwavering, somewhat 
unnatural smile, and seemingly quite baffled, replied:

“I beg your pardon, what kind of cover are you talking about Mr. 
Whittmore?”

Before Ethan had time to elaborate, Mr. Bloom had furrowed his 
brow, waving a `no-no' finger at Ethan. He got up from his chair 
and leisurely closed the door of his office. Ethan could only 
frown with genuine puzzlement while Mr. Bloom sat down again 
comfortably, lit his smoking pipe and had a puff. He then asked 
Ethan while looking him directly in the eye, his gaze strangely 
unnerving:

“Do you ask for a cunt when walking into a brothel, Mr. 
Whittmore? In such delicate matters, a little more room for 
maneuver is usually required. You'd ask for a girl or a woman, 
perhaps even some company. Not for a cunt, which what brothels 
have on offer. Are you following me, son?”

Ethan looked ever more perplexed, especially by the sudden change 
of mood in the middle-aged man. He understood he had been too 
blunt, but while trying to think what to say next and especially 
how to apologise, the public servant leaned closer to Ethan 
before continuing:

“Listen, old chap; everybody knows what we're doing here and 
everyone, including us, knows we're just doing pottery and 
traditional art exhibitions. On Thursdays there's a bagpipe 
night, though. Savvy?”

Ethan nodded numbly despite not actually understanding all too 
well what the man was trying to get at. Mr. Bloom saw the 
confusion written on Ethan's face and after sighing slightly, 
continued:

“Right. Well then, let's make things easier for you, and 
expediate the process. Is there someone I can call on your 
behalf? Someone who can help me, help you?”

At that, Ethan replied automatically, as if he had been waiting 
for that question for some time:

“Yes, sir. That would be Ian Ruthers, a personal friend.”

As suddenly as before, Mr. Bloom's attitude switched back to his 
jovial, well-mannered and quite expedient self. Wearing an almost 
disconcertingly wide grin on his face, he picked up the phone on 
his desk, dialed a single number, and said:

“Hello? Jenny? Put me through to Bristol. Yes, yes, definitely.”

A small wait ensued, which was reason enough for Ethan to start 
sweating even though the temperature inside the room was quite 
pleasant. Mr. Bloom kept smiling and nodding in a reassuring 
fashion, which only accentuated the weird stressful feeling 
anxiety that had overcome Ethan. Mr. Bloom was then heard talking 
over the phone:

“Hello? Leonard? Yes, it's me Isidor. Long time no see, but it's 
business again I'm afraid. Is Ruthers one of yours? I see. Is he 
hot right now? No? Ah, splendid. Could you tell him to give me a 
call please? Yes, my office. Well, right about now would be 
indeed a perfect time. I'd like to get on with this before lunch. 
Yes, well she's fine, working on her garden and all that. How's 
Marie? Loved her cherry pie last Christmas, marvellous stuff 
really. Would love to, old chap. Have your man call me, alright 
then? Goodbye Leonard, don't forget to give my regards. Goodbye.”

Once he hang up the phone, Mr. Bloom surprised Ethan once again 
with his choice of words:

“Fucking cunt can sod off. Now, let's clear up a few things: This 
friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod off as well. If he's going to 
push something for me down my pipe, that's fine and all. I don't 
give fuckall about the why or how. Do you understand that? I'm 
going home to Cheltenham before Christmas, and this desk can rot 
on my piss. And just so that you know, the cock around here 
tastes awful so brush often and have a care with that mouth of 
yours.”

Mr. Bloom put out his pipe, placed it in his shirt pocket, picked 
up his hat and strolled out of his office, careful to smoothly 
close the door behind him.

Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly 
had transpired. The only certainty was that Mr. Bloom had 
probably been for too long in the service. Ethan's thoughts were 
interrupted by the phone ringing. Hesitating at first but then 
thinking it should be Ruthers on the other end of the phone line, 
Ethan picked up the receiver:

“Hello? Ian? It's Ethan Whittmore. Well, what can I say? Didn't 
expect to hear me on this end, did you? What am I doing here? 
Well, first of all -- yes, I know I'm terrible. No, it wasn't -- 
I know I shouldn't be even talking to you like this but I need 
some help, Ian. No! I'm not married. Can you be serious for a 
minute? How you're working for Six I'll never understand. Well, 
now that I saw the guy in the Nigerian desk perhaps I do 
understand. Listen. Just listen. I need some cover. It's Andy, my 
brother. I need to go into Biafra. No joke. There will be no 
widow to comfort, so stop being a cunt and help me over here. 
Right, then. A piece of paper? I'm on it.”

[vphantom:]

James rolled a cigarette. Real imported tobacco, confiscated from 
Customs. A smile, a joke and a tap in the back usually go a long 
way. Especially when you're six feet tall and slightly less 
stocky than a bull. That was something that Ethan had said when 
they had first met. A piece of wisdom from Britain's finest.

He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen 
table. A hefty fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly 
serrated set of tiny teeth. The smell of roast dominated the room 
and through an open window the grill on the small porch could be 
seen; a few coals were settling down, their heat meaningless in 
the suffocating summer night of Lagos.

A wedding feast was being held down the next street, the gathered 
crowd milling about like a colourful circus troupe, dancing and 
singing with vigor despite everyone being thoroughly drenched in 
sweat. James peered at the small spectacle and stared blankly for 
a minute or two, as if his thoughts were completely disconnected 
with what was going on in front of him.

The crowd brought the groom to the fore, the improptu stage the 
middle of the street, and made a circle around him. He was all 
dressed up, smiling brightly. Everyone showered him with flowers 
and small gifts, while they danced to a deep, rhythmic beat of 
drums. His face seemed to shine almost imperceptibly with a gold 
sheen that somehow looked only natural under the light of the 
torches.

The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James' arm. He shook 
instinctively, ash marking the spot of the slight burn on his 
skin. His face didn't flinch though, nor did he seem to notice 
his cigarette was out. The phone in the bedroom was ringing with 
a mindless persistence that only a salesman would envy.

When James finally got up from his chair, the phone was ringing 
again. He stormed outside dressed in nothing but his shorts and 
ran towards the moving wedding feast barefooted. As he ran, he 
ran his tongue across his lips but couldn't tell his tears from 
his sweat.

Well met on an ill road

“Hello, Richard Owls. London Times. I presume you must be Dr. 
Ludwig Manteuffel. Glad you could take me in on such a short 
notice.”

A somewhat plumb, blond-haired man with a scruffy look and a 
thin, wiry receding hair line looked up from his writing pad 
through thick glasses and saw a red-haired, tall and almost gaunt 
man smiling and squinting under the uncomfortably radiant morning 
sun:

“There's room for more, actually. Your editor-in-chief was very 
pleasant on the phone, and quite convincing.”

Ethan laughed politely and replied, tilting his head only barely 
so he could shade his eyes at least:

“He's a wily bastard, I'll say. When he can tell his arse from 
his elbow that is.”

The doctor extended his hand casually and smiled, a bit puzzled:

“I hope he's not exhibiting a cognitive disfunction of such 
proportions. It could prove quite problematic in his line of 
work.”

Ethan shook the doctor's hand with some hesitation, shaking his 
head in ignorance:

“I can't say I'm quite following you, doctor.”

Dr. Manteuffel wiped the sweat on his forehead with the arm 
holding the writing pad and exhaled briskly with the hint of a 
slight laugh:

“Distasteful doctor's humor, Mr. Owls. Can I call you Richard? 
Please call me Ludwig, we'll be on the road together for some 
time. This isn't exactly a dinner party we're going to, yes?”

A number of people around them was busy loading the Land Rovers 
with all sorts of crates, bags, and sacks with everything from 
gauzes to canned food and flour. Ethan looked quite accustomed to 
the heat and the Nigerian sun, at odds with the stocky german 
doctor who seemed to be discomforted immensely, even though he 
tried his best not to show it. Ethan nodded with a sparkly grin 
and said:

“Can't see any drinks on offer, and the timing's off too. Ludwig, 
then?”

The german doctor motioned with his pad to the paltry shade 
offered by a nearby tent filled with crates stamped with the sign 
of the Red Cross, and Ethan lead eagerly. The doctor replied:

“You can also call me Baron. It's a nickname my colleagues often 
use, jokingly of course.”

“No real title then?”

“Oh, the family name is old and at some point there was some land 
associated with it. The land was sold but the title stuck. The 
war, you see.”

Ethan put down his knapsack and welcomed the shade, settling on a 
crate. His eyes seemed suddenly old, staring outside at the crowd 
of volunteers when he said:

“There's always some kind of war going on. Isn't that why you're 
here now?”

The doctor put down his pad on one of the crates, pulled a 
fold-up chair from a corner of the tent, spread it open and sat 
down, his relief obvious in the way he splayed his feed, heels on 
the dirt. He took a few short breaths before answering in a 
peculiar, thoughtful voice:

“I'm here to help in what way I can. Famine and disease are just 
as lethal as bullets from what I've seen. But why are you here?”

Ethan frowned in puzzlement and smiled in his usually disarming 
way. He tried to sound casually baffled when he said:

“Tell the world what's going on in Biafra. Take some pictures. 
Perhaps ask London for a raise too once I'm famous.”

The doctor put one leg on the other and seemed somewhat 
distraught, perhaps worried:

“So, a professional. I was hoping for a bit of a romantic you 
see. Every help we can get is better than none at all. And 
frankly, you look like you don't need much help in these parts.”

Ethan crossed his arms against his chest, purely an instinctive 
defensive motion that only helped to show his nervousness. His 
charm didn't seem to work as intended, and his sly grin was his 
way of showing he genuinely liked the plumb Prussian doctor for 
his openness:

“What can I say, I've been places. Suez. Kenya. Angola. Vietnam.”

The doctor reached into his sweat-stained shirt's pocket and 
procured a pack of Camel's. He put one into his mouth and 
proferred one to Ethan as well, who politely nodded his refusal, 
the grin unwaveringly attached on his tanned face. The doctor got 
up from his seat, while searching around for something to light 
his cigarette. His reply came with a slightly muffled voice:

“I'm sure you enjoy travelling. A lot, I might add. Light?”

Ethan laughed and felt somewhat unburdened. He offered Dr. 
Manteufel a lighter from one of his pants' side pockets:

“I can't really say what's on your mind, Ludwig.”

The doctor lit his Camel and seemed to cherish the moment before 
answering, his eyes squarely meeting Ethan's gaze before asking 
him straight:

“Are you going to be trouble? We don't need any more trouble 
where we're going.”

Ethan took his lighter back and answered the doctor, the sudden 
quietness in his voice the only indication that he himself was 
somewhat uncertain:

“I want to stay out of trouble as much as you do.”

Ludwig drew on his cigarette once more, this time exhaling 
briskly and adding hastily:

“Good. That's good. Thank you.”

Ethan nodded in silence before the doctor went on:

“I just want to help these people, and stay alive in the process. 
Is it too much to ask?”

“No, I suppose it's not.”

Ludwig then put out his cigarette in the dirt and wiped his 
forehead once more. He seemed to mumble to himself:

“Good man. A good man.”

Ethan noticed and asked the doctor, his voice right on the edge 
of doubt:

“How can you tell?”

Ludwig looked at him with some reluctance before replying:

“I can't. But I have hope.”

* * *

[vphantom:]Space inside the Land Rover was at a premium. Not an inch of 
space had gone to waste; it almost seemed like the passengers 
inside were intruding on the cargo space and not the other way 
around. Ethan had come up with a very comfortable-looking seating 
arrangement on top of a sack of rice, along with a wooden crate 
against his back and a couple of flour bags to put his feet up 
on. He and the doctor were riding along together at the rear of 
the small convoy of Land Rovers.

Ludwig was sweating profusely, and kept dabbing his forehead and 
face with a small hand towel. It only made his suffering a little 
less unbearable and a little more obvious. Ethan had been 
sleeping on and off, the car's continuous jerks and road bumps 
having developed into a sort of lullaby. Their driver was 
invariably focused on the task at hand, barely uttering a word. 
Ludwig could not stop himself from asking, straining his voice to 
be heard over the roar of the diesel engine. Even though at 
previous times he hadn't received an answer he could make good 
use of yet, his pitch had an air of optimism about it:

“Are we going to stop any time soon, Olufemi?”

The driver's answer was curt and to the point, as had been the 
case previously as well.

“Yes.”

Ludwig who would otherwise consider an endless talker a nuisance 
at best, appeared to be edging on aggravation. Olufemi's 
brusqueness felt like he was doing the doctor a favor by even 
considering an answer.

The doctor made another effort to engage in conversation or at 
least learn some hopefully interesting information about their 
whereabouts:

“Well, could you refine that somewhat? How soon exactly, is soon? 
More or less, of course.”

Olufemi paused for a moment before answering in his usual, 
quietly dry manner:

“Before nightfall.”

Ludwig nodded to himself, and tried to clear his parched throat 
with little success and barely a spit. Ethan had a contemplating 
look drawn upon his face, his gaze darting from bush to grove. He 
held his camera in hand, the inadvertent swarm of flies seemingly 
rather fond of him. Ludwig tried to get his attention, engage in 
some kind of discussion to relieve himself of the dullness:

“That camera.. It's a Leica, right?”

Ethan turned to face Ludwig with a furrowed brow, and having been 
caught unawares asked rather plainly:

“I'm sorry?”

Ludwig repeated himself, this time almost shouting:

“The camera. It's a Leica M3, right? Some very good equipment you 
have there.”

Ethan shrugged indifferently, effortlessly shooting down Ludwig's 
hopes. A prolonged silence followed once again, regularly 
interrupted by the creaks and croans of the Land Rover's chassis. 
As the evening wore by, flies began to give their place to 
mosquitoes. The grassy hills rushed by, lush with vegetation, 
filled with tall, thin trees and distant mangroves. The swampy 
savannah drew distant with every passing minute.

Ethan turned and addressed Olufemi in Yoruba with a ghastly 
accent, but decent enough to be understood. The driver suddenly 
burst into laughter and started talking vividly with Ethan. A 
torrential flow of Yoruba was intermixed with laughs, giggles and 
extravagant hand gestures. Ethan was responding in kind, and 
judging by his tone, sometimes asking, sometimes filling in and 
sometimes simply nodding. Olufemi even made eye contact with 
Ludwig once, before breaking down in laughter once more before 
finally being able to settle down to his invariably dull and 
sullen mood. Ludwig looked at Ethan with eyes that shone rather 
irregularly and a voice slightly reminiscent of gritted teeth:

“Care to share, Richard?”

The last word sounded unusually venomous for the good doctor. 
Ethan countered the doctor's irate mood with a radiating smile. 
He explained:

“He thinks you talk too much.”

Ludwig raised his brow and nodded, right before instinctively 
slapping his arm, failing to kill a mosquito. Before Ludwig could 
have had the chance to retort in a manner unbecoming of a doctor, 
Olufemi suddenly cut in:

“For a doctor. We dem almost there. See now, the clearing.”

Both of them looked up ahead to where the road steered off course 
and into a dirt path that seemed to lead slowly upwards onto a 
small ridge. Ludwig asked then with barely conceiled 
exhilaration:

“Is that where we stop for the night?”

Olufemi gave a nod instead of answering properly, while Ethan was 
looking more and more at the sky, its rosy and purple hues 
lighting up the gathering clouds, dressing them in the imagery of 
cotton candy. While the last light could be seen falling around 
them, Ethan said with some disappointment:

“It's going to rain like the devil, that's for sure.”

The driver nodded his silent agreement, while Ludwig said with 
the slightest hint of irony:

“I thought Brits liked rain.”

To which Ethan commented wryly:

“We like rain alright. It's all that water we could live without.”

Olufemi started laughing again, and this time Ludwig managed to 
crack a smile. Ethan laid back on his sack once more while the 
first droplets of water gathered on the windshield. Ludwig 
retorted with a grin:

“And the rest of us could be spared your dry sense of humor as 
well.”

Ethan lit up a cigarette and inhaled deeply before answering:

“Well said.”

As Ludwig joined him, the small droplets rapidly grew into a 
proper tropical storm, causing even Olufemi to exclaim:

“Dis dey proper fuck.”

Ethan was about to translate when Ludwig made himself heard over 
the din of the storm:

“I think I get the idea, Richard.”

Visibility had been reduced to the car up ahead, and only thanks 
to the powerful headlights. The caravan was moving with a walking 
speed, carefully treading on a dirt-turned-into-mud path barely 
wide enough to call a road. Olufemi made some colourful remarks 
about the driving conditions, to which Ethan remarked they should 
be happy they weren't being shot at.

Ludwig stabbed Ethan with a gaze unusually hard and firm for such 
a seemingly light-mannered man and asked him:

“Would it make good press?”

Ethan shrugged and before he had time to answer, a blinding flash 
lit the area in front of them and in the blink of an eye they 
felt the surging overpressure of a shockwave on their eardrums. A 
wall of dirt and mud seemed to go up in the air, lifting with it 
the chassis of the Rover in front of the column. Ethan's shouting 
was barely heard through buzzing eardrums:

“Landmine! Stop, stop! Get out, now!”

Olufemi panicked and let go of the wheel, their car bumping on 
the Rover in front. The flaming debris of the destroyed Land 
Rover could be seen, lying on the edge of the road upturned and 
torn. Pandemonium ensued.

“What was that?” Ludwig asked with a slight tremor in his voice. 
The answer from Ethan came accompanied by a powerful shove:

“Landmine or RPG! Now move! Out of the car! And stay low!”

Olufemi was faster to comply, opening his door and rushing out, 
frantically searching for more flashes or explosions, but none 
came. Ludwig sloppily made his way out of the doors in the back 
of the Rover over the assorted bags and crates, while Ethan 
opened the window behind him and drew himself out in a fluid 
motion.

He shouted to the bewildered people in the caravan, some of which 
had already stepped outside their Rovers, dazed and confused:

“Get out! Lay low and don't move!”

Ethan's eyes were frantically looking for signs of movement in 
the torrential rain, the light from the headlamps the only source 
of illumination. There were no muzzle flashes, launch trails or 
smoke. Lots of shouting and confusion, but the characteristic 
hammering sound of AKs was absent. This was not an ambush. 
Ethan's voice took on an authoritative yet calming tone:

“Calm down. Stay put. No-one's shooting at us. It was a landmine. 
Tell the people next to you to calm down and stay put.”

Everyone was drenched to the bone. All around him, Ethan could 
see faces frozen in sheer terror, some of them shaking visibly. 
Olufemi had started shouting calls to the other drivers in 
Yoruba, when Ethan's instincts kicked in; he quickly walked over 
him and put a hand to his mouth. Olufemi was surprised and looked 
at Ethan sideways, giving him a look of frustrated fear. Ethan 
put one finger to his mouth while shaking his head, and let go of 
Olufemi's mouth:

“No shouting, not in Yoruba. Understand, mate? Not around these 
parts.”

Olufemi could only nod. Rather baffled though he was, he motioned 
with his hands to the other drivers who by now had his attention 
to `lay low'. With fear and hesitation as plentiful as the rain 
pouring down on them, the drivers complied, some of them already 
on their knees and praying.

Ethan felt the heavy rain on his head, tried to wash away 
everything else and focus on the moment. He needed to calmly tell 
these people what to do next, when Ludwig came up from behind 
him, the sound of his approach muffled by the rain and the din 
from the people in shock. Ethan's eye simply caught a shadow 
approaching. He twisted around sharply, grabbed Ludwig from one 
arm and place his foot to act as a pivot. Before having time to 
actually see Ludwig, he was already throwing him down to the 
dirt, still grabbing his arm.

Ludwig splashed in the mud yelling, markedly scared and 
half-witted:

“It's me! It's me! Scheisse!”

Ethan breathed deeply, letting some of the adrenaline wear off 
before picking up Ludwig and offering his apologies:

“Sorry I jumped on you. It's a conditioned reflex.”

Ludwig could not help but shout irately:

“Conditioned reflex?!”

“Just so happens, yes. Never mind that, we need to get these 
people off the road. Someone fucked up the itinerary. Olufemi!”

The driver turned and nodded. He looked shaken but he was 
evidently quick about his wits. Ethan leaned slightly towards 
him, shouting to be heard and pointing at the column of stopped 
rovers and the frightened crowd:

“Step on the Rovers' tracks. Tell the rest of the drivers to get 
the people back inside. See if anyone's wounded, get the doctors 
working on them. We'll be safe as houses then.”

Olufemi nodded and carefully started walking towards the first 
Rover, while the people were shouting out questions to noone in 
particular. Ethan started walking up the front of the column, 
carefully passing by people and telling everyone to be calm and 
emphasize that they were probably safe.

Once he reached the debris of the first Rover, he saw the people 
in the second car frozen still. They had bled out of their ears, 
probably deaf and scared to death. Ethan took a closer look: the 
driver was still clutching his wheel, all tensed up and in shock. 
The explosion had shattered the windshield, and along the water 
that had pooled inside there was what remained of a shattered, 
blown away arm. The driver had shattered fragments of glass all 
over his face, and his eyes were a bloody mess.

Ethan shouted to Ludwig:

“Ludwig! Grab a first aid kit, and come up front! Face injury! 
Try and stay on the tire tracks!”

Ludwig nodded affirmatively and disappeared in the back of the 
Rover. Ethan grabbed the blind man from one arm and told him 
nothing. He simply squeezed him gently and felt the man's blood 
pumping like a flooded river.

Once Ludwig arrived he shot a quick glance at the blown up 
vehicle, and quickly turned to say something to Ethan who shook 
his head in denial:

“Not a chance, mate. I'm sorry. Enough explosives to throw five 
thousand pounds six feet in the air. It's a bloody miracle this 
one's lost just his eyes instead of his head. The others are in 
the back, scared shitless, a bit deaf probably but otherwise in 
one piece.”

Ludwig nodded appreciatively and focused on the task at hand, 
trying not to think about the people in that first Rover. His 
motions were calm and professional, as if he was working in an 
examination room. Ethan urged him to hurry up, and took a few 
steps forward towards the small crater which had effortlessly 
turned into a pool. He took out a flashlight from one of his 
pants' pockets and a large leaf-shaped knife from an ankle belt. 

He crouched and slowly crept towards the pool, carefully studying 
the ground, digging in with the knife at seemingly random 
intervals. Going past the pool, his eyes avidly scanned the mud. 
Before long, even under the unabating rain and all the mess of 
debris he caught a glimpse of a dull olive-green shape barely 
protruding from the muddy ground. A careful prod at the rim with 
the knife let him know this was another landmine. A few feet to 
his right, he could make out the outline of another. A slow, 
careful sweep with the flashlight uncovered two more, less than 
ten feet apart. He slid back to the crater and got up, jogging 
back to Ludwig and the injured man.

A certain amount of quiet and calm had started to settle among 
the crowd. Olufemi could be seen quietly exchanging concerned 
looks with the other drivers, some of them already back inside 
their Rovers, trying to find a dry smoke.

“It's a proper god-awful minefield,” said Ethan to Ludwig.

Ludwig was still dressing the eyes of the driver, after having 
administered some sedatives for the excruciating pain that would 
follow the end of the adrenaline rush. He was dripping wet, 
smeared with blood all over his hands and shirt.

“Your deductive reasoning amazes me,” said the doctor, not 
bothering to hide the tone of irony. Ethan replied calmly:

“It could have been a single land mine, an old ambush site. No, 
this was a proper minefield, there's probably more of them around 
the bushes and trees. We need to go back. I don't know who 
decided on this itinerary, but it wasn't safe. Killed those 
people in the Rover, and it might have killed us all. Might still 
as well. We need to get moving out of here.”

Ludwig suddenly stopped tending to the wounded driver. He closed 
his eyes and seemed to whisper something in German. Ethan told 
him sternly:

“What are you blabbering about? They're dead, Ludwig. Come on 
now, pull it together.”

The doctor exploded with fury at Ethan, letting his utensils drop 
to the mud:

“I picked the roads! It was me! So fuck you, Mr. Owls!”

Ethan fell instantly silent, knowing there was nothing meaningful 
to say to the doctor. The next moment, the doctor was leaning on 
the side of the Rover, emptying his stomach involuntarily.

Olufemi noticed the slight commotion, and came a bit closer to 
see. Ethan explained to Olufemi as he approached:

“We need to go back, around another way. It's probably best if we 
can stop for the night someplace near. Anything in mind?”

Olufemi seemed to pause and think for a while, and then nodded 
with renewed vigor:

“Yes, dey is a mission,” his voice ringing clear through the 
never-ending rain.

“What kind of a mission?”

“French Catholic. Nuns,” replied Olufemi with a very peculiar and 
untimely grin.

Ludwig suddenly stood straight, hanging onto the Rover's door 
though, and said with a pale face:

“We're going back. This caravan is no more.”

Rivulets of rain ran freely down Ethan's taut face when he said 
with the slightest hint of irony:

“How are you going to help then, doctor?”

“I'll have no more blood on my hands. I can never -”

“You're scared out of your mind, I know. Maybe you've shat 
yourself, or pissed on your pants. Can't tell with the bloody 
rain. It's only natural. Fear is natural.”

“It doesn't matter what I feel, damn you! These people trusted me 
with their -”

“Signed the papers, didn't they? Listen, this is fuckall, 
alright? You can't think straight. Olufemi, take point in our 
Rover. I'll drive this one. Doctor, seriously, grab a couple of 
sedatives yourself and just hang on. Alright?”

Ludwig stared blankly at Ethan, while Olufemi hurried to spread 
the word to the other drivers. Ethan moved the driver in the 
co-driver's seat, and told a practically deaf nurse and a red 
cross volunteer with a broken arm that they were leaving now. At 
length, before he urged Ludwig to get in the Rover, the doctor 
asked him:

“Do you know what you're doing?”

Ethan felt odd suddenly. He had heard that same question probably 
a thousand times from a hundred different people, but somehow 
this time it sounded as different as it was familiar. And even 
though he felt naturally inclined to grin and answer `bloody hell 
no', he calmly said to the doctor:

“It will be alright now. Just get in the car with Olufemi, and 
try not to think.”

The doctor made his way to the Rover with a slouch, exhaustion 
drawn all over his face. Ethan got into the now vacant driver's 
seat and put the gear into reverse. He felt like he was turning 
into an accomplished liar, something he had thought he'd despise. 
Strangely enough, all he could think of was his bad leg.

[vphantom:]

Ludwig nodded his silent thanks to the sister who in turn smiled 
serenely and left the room with measured prudishness. A couple of 
oil lamps, one on a plain wooden shelf and another on an equally 
unadorned table gave off a warm light, accented at times by the 
flash of lightning pouring in through the small stained glass 
window. The glass added a reddish hue that seemed to have 
attracted Ethan's gaze like a moth to a fire, his face set in 
stone, perched inside the cups of his hands.

Ludwig took a cigarette from his pack, his hands still shaking. 
He was about to offer it to Ethan when he suddenly rose up from 
the small cot and blinked furiously as if awaking from a long, 
deep slumber of which he had no recollection. He asked Ludwig 
then:

“How is everyone?”

The doctor lit the cigarette and stared outside the window, even 
though there was nothing to see but dark, pouring rain and a 
circus of fleeting, random shadows. His voice sounded 
unassumingly flat:

“The driver is running a high fever. He's on antibiotics, and I 
though I removed as much of the shrapnel as I could under the 
circumstances. Nothing can be done about his hearing. Tartoovi 
and Donaldson have probably gone deaf for life. I had to sedate 
them. They're sleeping now. The rest, some small cuts, bruises 
and the occasional dislocation or sprain.”

“That's good to hear.”

The doctor's eyes suddenly seemed to pop while his face tensed 
with seeping anger at those words.

“Is that some sick joke, Mr. Owls? People died tonight, for God's 
sake!”

“It could have been worse. There could have been more dead on 
that trail tonight.”

A flash of lightning cast a freakish shadow in the small 
guestroom. A few moments passed before the sound of thunder 
rolled by, when Ludwig managed to speak again:

“What kind of person says such a thing? These people..”

“They're dead, and you have to live with that. Deal with it, 
Ludwig. There's nothing that can be done now about it.”

Ludwig stood with a half-opened mouth, seemingly unable to find 
the right words.

“How can you be so.. Detached? I mean, they were.. Jesus, 
Richard.”

Ethan gave the doctor a long hard stare. His eyes seemed to waver 
a little, while his visage remained stern and grave-looking. His 
voice was pitched lower than usual:

“It happens after a while, doctor. It keeps me sane, it keeps me 
alive. It's not something to be proud of, but that's just as 
human as curling up in a corner and crying, blaming yourself or 
others.”

Another thunder reverberated inside the small chamber, the small 
flame in the oil lamp on the shelf trembling in tune. Ludwig put 
out his cigarette and took off his glasses. He reached into his 
pockets and produced a small piece of clean linen with which he 
started cleaning his glasses. Ethan started to say something when 
the doctor spoke to him without meeting his gaze:

“It seems you have everything worked out. You know your way 
around people dying, dealing with traumatic disorders and guilt. 
So tell me, please, is it normal if I feel like punching you in 
the face?”

Ethan paused for a moment, and shrugged almost apologetically. He 
replied:

“If you think it'll make you feel better, then by all means. I'm 
not your problem though. You're still emotional from what 
happened, and that's just --”

Ludwig's fist connected with Ethans cheekbone and stopped him 
mid-sentence. Before he slammed the frail door behind him as he 
left the room, Ludwig shouted in a fit of rage:

“Emotional?! What would you know about emotions?”

Ethan was caught off-guard, but recovered quickly enough. He 
rushed outside the small guestroom and onto an ill-lit corridor. 
Even as he started off to follow the doctor, a figure suddenly 
appeared to be blocking his way. He stopped and looked genuinely 
surprised when he saw a tall, slender woman sporting a look that 
could have bored a hole in his face. Subdued light poured off a 
small opening to her right. She was still holding the tattered 
curtain that served as a door when she sternly told Ethan:

“For God's sake, be quiet!”

“I'm sorry about the noise and all, sister but it really is none 
of your business so --”

The slap across Ethan's face came out almost out of nowhere. It 
jolted him back into the deep memory of a well-mannered childhood 
for only a tiny moment, and the accented yet quite clear voice 
served to reattach his awareness into the current state of 
affairs and a very irate woman:

“It is my business, and I'm not anyone's sister! These people 
need peace and quiet!” she said and pulled back the curtain to 
reveal a cluster of makeshift beds, cots and matresses filled 
with people.

“Who the hell are you lady?”

“My name's Nicole Heurgot, I'm a nurse and whoever you are you 
have a big mouth and an even bigger as-”

“Mademoiselle, ca suffit!”

The sister superior appeared through the curtain and she looked 
rather disappointed at such an exchange. She said to Ethan:

“Monsieur Owls, please. If you must, take this outside. There are 
sick and wounded in here, and not just your caravan. Et vous, 
mademoiselle Heurgot, calme toi. S'il vous-plait.”

And with that, she returned inside to the makeshift bed chamber 
posing as a nursing station.

Nicole's stare was still hard when she said to Ethan, almost 
stunned in place:

“Not an english gentleman at all, are you?”

Ethan tried to sound apologetic when he said: “Listen, I'm sorry 
but some people died today and we got into a heated debate. I 
wouldn't expect you to be that understanding.” He actually 
sounded more like some kind of elitist snob who thought people 
were incapable of doing anything right.

Nicole retorted with an accusing, yet hushed tone: “People tend 
to do that thing around here. You assume too much. Perhaps you're 
in the wrong place.”

Her feisty attitude only served to make Ethan's head cock 
sideways before he replied with a sleight hint of aggravation: “
I'd be inclined to say the same about you.”

“And you'd be wrong,” Nicole said before adding: “Your sort 
usually are. Why don't you take some pictures in there? Isn't 
that what you came here for after all?”

It was a verbal attack; even though her voice was kept low at all 
times she sounded positively miffed. Ethan found that 
agressiveness almost attractive. He was smiling thinly when he 
told her:

“You really don't like me at all, do you?”

With a gaze slightly reminiscent of the mythic gorgon and an 
unmistakably french accent, she simply answered with another 
unveiled insult: “Vultures you mean? Nobody does.”

Ethan pondered about that word for a moment, and thought it funny 
that a journalist could draw more fire than a solder. He then 
told Nicole, “I think you're biased. I said I'm sorry, and I 
really mean it. I was trying to apologise to Ludwig when I ran 
into you.”

Pointing to the small nursing station behind her she said with 
demanding undertones in her voice: “Well you should apologise to 
these people as well.”

Ethan tried to sound like a gentleman, using a grin that was in 
truth better suited to guile the unscrupulous sort of women that 
seemed already hooked by the sight of a Royal Marine uniform: “
Can I start by apologising to you?”

“If this is your idea of english charm, you're more misguided 
than you look,” replied Nicole with a shake of her head and an 
almost sympathising grimace on her face.

The more distant she became, the more Ethan's interest was piqued 
by what he felt like was a genuine example of the kind of women 
he rarely met: the hard ones. “You're a very unforgiving person 
for a nurse, do you know that?” he said, this time without a grin 
or a smile.

Nicole kept at him in the same vein: “And you're hardly a person 
yourself.”

“Listen, I think we've started on the wrong foot here. Please, 
give me a chance to make amends,” said Ethan, sounding genuinely 
sincere. It had little effect:

“I think I've wasted enough time with you already, Mr. Owls. Go 
back to your room and be thankful there are people who care, like 
the mother superior. People tolerant enough even to the likes of 
your kind.”

“Ah, vultures you mean? You make it sound like this whole bloody 
mess is my fault.”

She shrugged and said, looking suddenly morose instead of angry: “
I just don't see how taking pictures of death, destruction and 
starving children can do any good.”

Ethan replied in a very serious tone, in an almost dangerous 
display of frankness, “Would it do any good if I was carrying a 
rifle instead?”

She paused for a moment, looking at Ethan with a set of piercing 
blue eyes that seemed to be trying to peer beyond those last few 
words of his: “We wouldn't even be talking if that was the case. 
Now please, haranguing me like that won't get you anywhere. I 
have much more pressing matters to attend to,” said and made to 
leave while Ethan's gaze floated around until it met her left 
arm, where a piece of gauze stuck out from under her sleeve. 

“Like that arm of yours? You're injured yourself, aren't you?”

“You think you have a keen eye for misery? If only you were so 
thoughtful of everyone else as well,” she said with evident 
disapproval.

Ethan just threw his hands in the air and said:“For God's sake, 
you haven't even given me a chance, right from the start.”

Nicole was looking at him when she suddenly smiled ironically and 
said: “You think it's unfair?”

Ethan waved a hand above his head and replied: “This whole 
business is unfair to everyone here. Shouldn't you allow for some 
leeway, even when dealing with vultures?”

She paused for a moment, as if measuring everything about Ethan 
with a casual glance from head to toe:

“If you want some leeway, and if you're willing to really 
apologize and make amends, then come lend a hand. You can carry 
things around without taking any pictures, can't you?” she said, 
following her question up with a smile that might not have been 
as ironic as the first one.

“The lighting's all bad anyway,” replied Ethan with a grin that 
came across as a bad touch.

“I find your sense of humor out of place,” said Nicole flatly.

“I try, but I always end up in the wrong place for some reason,” 
said Ethan and nodded to himself. Nicole replied with a frank 
voice:

“You're a complex man, Mr. Owls.”

Ethan smiled thinly before he crossed his arms and said: “I 
thought I was a vulture.”

“You might still prove to be just that.”

“I can't really change your mind, can I?” he said and shook his 
head.

As she pulled the curtain to the nursing station aside, she 
showed the way inside and said with what seemed to her genuine 
smile: “You can try.”

* * *

Purple and red hues of dawn sheepishly tried to blossom far away, 
the earth still wet and napping, the chill humid breeze unusually 
refreshing. Nicole's gaze wandered around the monastery's rock 
and mud walls for a moment, before it focused on the bell towers. 
One was set facing the east, the other towards the Vatican; from 
the weary look on her face, both directions looked equally 
distant in any measureable way, whether it be space or time.

Ethan approached her casually without any hint of their former 
quarrelsome chat. He offered her a cigarette which she silently 
accepted. He lit it up, and they both sat on a stone wall near 
the wall, letting the morning wind carry away all the weight of 
the night before.

Helping Nicole with her rounds had mellowed her somewhat to the 
point where she no longer considered him a vulture. Not only had 
she admitted being too quick to judge, but she had also been 
openly impressed by Ethan's quick-and-dirty first-aid knowledge, 
turning any simple item into a tourniquet or a splinter. It 
struck her as odd but Ethan had managed to explain that any 
journalist that wanted to get alive out of a warzone had to be a 
medic as well. She had smiled at that and said with just a hint 
of mischief: “My, my; and you can type as well”.

But nothing on her face that morning came close to that austere, 
quirky nurse with the outspoken dislike of journalists and other 
vermin that seemed to feed on human misery: As she sat there 
smoking, she struck Ethan as a very familiar face, someone close 
but yet so distant in memory. Like a long lost friend or perhaps, 
a lover. He kept trying to remember, and was soon enthralled by 
the warmth of her face, lost in his little own box of memories.

As she took another puff from her cigarette, she casually looked 
around and caught Ethan with his gaze fixated on her, his eyes 
out of focus. She asked him then, with just the right amount of 
disapproval in her soft voice:

“Anything you particularly like, Mr. Owls?” to which no answer 
came. She asked again, this time less pretentiously:

“Richard? Lost somewhere?” she said, and broke the spell.

“Hmm? Sorry.” he finally managed to answer before he himself 
asked in earnest: “I must've been woolgathering, what were you 
saying?”

Nicole shrugged and said, “Nothing. You just stood there and kept 
looking at me,” before she 

added all high-browed yet smiling slightly, “Looking for 
something in particular?”

Ethan smiled with a corner of his lip in a bitter fashion before 
exhaling, the smoke swiftly vanishing away in little curls and 
twists. He sounded somewhat reticent, weighed-down when he said:

“That's a funny thing to ask; you could say I am, but it's not 
you. Though you do remind me of someone. I just can't put a name 
to it; it's a slippery thing.”

The bells started to chime then; it was time for the morning 
prayer. A few sisters could be seen around the courtyard, 
hurriedly but quietly moving about for the mass. It struck Ethan 
as odd then how similar it all looked to a roll call: quiet, 
practiced, efficient. “Unto God's own image,” he said then half 
to himself, while he pointed to the shuffling silhouettes of the 
nuns.

Nicole turned around to look and through a small window the first 
cautious rays of sunlight caused her to squint even though she 
sat in the shadow of the walls. She shook her head and said, “
Such a waste,” before she put out her cigarette and folded her 
arms.

Ethan frowned and asked her: “You mean, the nuns?”

She half-turned around to look at him, while warm sunlight made 
her hair glow as if from within and said, “I mean God.”

Ethan let out a small laugh before he said: “That's a funny thing 
to say for someone working in a monastery. It's almost a joke, 
actually.”

Her eyes suddenly took on that earlier piercing glint that 
conveyed her annoyance instantly. She retorted:

“'He' is the joke. It's just that people don't seem to get it, 
more often than not. In a sense, it's better that way. Imagine if 
these nuns were used as forced labor, sold and exchanged like 
cattle. At least the lie they live in doesn't make things any 
worse.”

“I've always wondered. Don't you people believe in anything?”

She frowned, cocked her head sideways and asked him: “What do you 
mean, 'you people'?”

“Atheists,” he said and put out his own cigarette, stamping it on 
the red soil.

She laughed heartily despite herself and said with a grin:

“For a moment there, I thought you would've said 'communists'.”

“I try not to mix politics and religion.”

“Aren't they the same?”

“Not quite. I mean, no one actually believes politicians, right? 
At least I hope not.”

“I wish it was a laughing matter, but it's really not.”

“So you place all your trust in man then? Look around you. We're 
not exactly doing a bang up job, are we?”



“I have faith in man. The sisters here have faith in God. And I 
do not consider myself an atheist; I just have a grudge against 
people who think God has anything to do with this life,” she said 
and brushed a lock of her hair away from her cheek.

Ethan looked at her in a pensive mood. 'What an interesting 
woman', he thought to himself. He lowered his gaze to his feet 
and said:

“I'm not a church-going fellow myself, not by a long-shot. But 
sometimes, some things just make you wish for something to grab 
and hold on.”

“Like a woman?” she said, her grin almost meant to tease. He 
laughed and waved no with his hands.

“Heaven forbid, no. In any case, I meant something. Not someone. 
Like an idea, a symbol, a flag. Maybe a flag. You know, something 
to-”

“Idolize,” she filled in on cue and made him nod.

“Yeah, you might call it like that.”

“Look around you, it's everywhere. What the sisters hold on to.”

“I wouldn't know anything about nuns.”

“What happened to a journalist's keen senses?” she said, and 
pointed with an index finger to the church bell tower. On top of 
it, stood a plain iron cross. Ethan smiled thinly and shook his 
head.

“Ah. Well, I guess that was blatantly obvious. Perhaps I should 
think about a career change.”

“Maybe. Sometimes I think like that myself.”

“Really? It gets to you, doesn't it?”

“I try to think of the larger picture. That I'm helping save 
lives. But it doesn't always work. That's why sometimes I need 
this,” she said and showed Ethan a chain around her neck, a 
simple unadorned St. Andrews cross on it. It looked familiar. He 
felt the urge to take a closer look.

“A cross? May I?”

She nodded and took off the cross that she had been wearing: it 
was a simple, unadorned silver St. Andrews cross. Ethan took it 
in his hand and it immediately felt more than familiar - he 
turned it around and he saw the letters 'A.N.W.' carved on the 
backside. Andy Nathaniel Whittmore. This was Andy's cross.

Thoughts and wishes mingled in one as they raced to take control 
of his mouth. He tried but he couldn't remember the last time he 
had actually been at a loss. His face was motionless, unable to 
look anything other than utterly confounded.

Nicole saw that and couldn't help asking:

“What is it? What's bothering you?”

“That cross. That's Andy's cross. My brother's.”

“Your brother? That's ridiculous,” she said and looked scornfully 
away, unabashedly dismissive in her expression.

He didn't give it a second thought. All the constructed facade he 
had went to some considerable effort to create suddenly felt 
completely worthless and immaterial.

“It's not,” he said and took off his own twin cross and showed it 
to her. It wasn't as polished and there was a silver-grey patina 
all over it, but the initials 'E.R.W.' stood out clearly.

“That's for Ethan Roiel Whittmore. And that cross of yours has 
Andy Nathaniel Whittmore carved on its back. That's my brother's 
cross.”

“But.. You said your name is Richard Owls. What's this all about?”

“Where did you get that cross?”

“That's my husband's cross.”

The connotation made Ethan blink twice. He almost stuttered when 
he asked:

“Andy? Andy got married? You're his wife? Where is he, what 
happened?”

Ethan's face became a mask of anxiety, contorted and flushed. His 
breathing became shallower, as if he was about to jump into an 
ice cold ocean of fear and doubt. Nicole's stare was fixed on the 
cross as she traced its edges. She spoke then with a low, uneven 
voice, as if she was telling story better left unsaid:

“Our camp was attacked. Tribal lords. Little more than feral men, 
they came one day and wanted to loot everything. Including the 
women. Some of us tried to put up a fight. Perhaps it was a 
mistake. During the shooting, a few had the chance to run away. 
Andy with some of the guides stayed behind, buy us time. He was 
bleeding when.. He.. He gave me this cross. He was a believer, 
you see. Funny, no?”

Tears welled in her eyes but she did not cry, even though it 
seemed like she should. Ethan saw how easily her facade of a 
strict, haughty nurse had crumbled away when she mentioned her 
husband. Thoughts about that camp ran around Ethan's head. A 
strange forlorn feeling of an idea formed up in his head. He told 
her then in his most steady, thoughtful voice:

“I'm looking for Andy. All this, it's just a cover. I need you to 
tell me everything that happened that day.”

Her face suddenly became a bit pale. She looked disturbed, 
stricken with sudden anxiety.

“But Andy.. He has barely mentioned you. What is this? Some kind 
of sick joke?”

“I'm being dead serious. I'm risking my hide for this. I just 
want to find my brother, don't you? You can't give up on him. We 
just can't.”

“But Andy's.. He was bleeding from his leg, looking all pale when 
we.. No, he's just as good as dead. Those men wouldn't just.. 
Animals, not men. You don't know what it was like!”

“Have you given up on him already? He's a doctor for christ's 
sake, they'd need him alive, too useful to be killed outright. 
There's a really good chance he's alive, Nicole.”

“I can't believe that right now. I just can't. I saw his eyes, 
Richard. I saw nothing but emptiness..”

“Please, call me Ethan. Whatever you saw, it's just the grief and 
the pain talking right now. If he wasn't dead when you left, he 
was alive and that's what I'm counting on.”

“I want to believe you, I really do. But, what can we do? I 
mean.. Those people.. Even if..”

“You said you had faith. Have faith in me, please. Did he ever 
talk to you about Father Mulcahey?”

She rubbed her eyes with both hands. There was a deep frown on 
her face when she said:

“The name sounds familiar. Why?”

“Those crosses. We were ten. Well, I was twelve years old, Andy 
was ten. I'd snuck in Father Mulcahey's office. I'd made a bet, I 
could get my mates a bottle of sacramental wine. When Father 
Mulcahey got wind off the missing bottle, he roused us out of 
bed. He asked nicely which one of lads did it. I was about to 
take the punishment and the hail marys that went along with it, 
when Andy steps out front, says he was the culprit. Everyone else 
goes back to sleep, and then the father calls us both into the 
office. I was thinking we were going to get a beating either way. 
Instead, he opens up this little box and offers us a set of 
crosses. Makes us wear them and take a vow. Next month during the 
holidays, we had our initials carved. Been on me every day since 
then.”

“What was the vow?”

“Never leave your brother behind. That's what I'm doing. I'm not 
leaving Andy behind.”

* * *

The voice on the small speaker sounded worried and uneven.

“What's wrong? Why couldn't you wait for the courier?”

“There's a problem.”

The matter-of-fact voice on the microphone was a woman's voice. 
It had a bit of an accent.

“What kind? It doesn't sound like you to talk around things.”

“I'm not sure if it's exactly a problem. I might have stumbled on 
your brother.”

“My what?” said the man, his voice full of disbelief and shocked 
surprise.

“I met a man today who posed as a journalist by the name of 
Richard Owls. Long story short, he says he's your brother, Ethan. 
We were talking, and showed him your cross, playing the widow 
part. Thought your death might look good on a paper. He showed me 
a cross with his initials on it, E.R.W. He also told me about 
Father Mulcahey's sacramental wine. Is it really him? Strong, 
red-haired fellow. Has these piercing blue eyes. Medium height.”

An uncomfortable silence ensued. Nicole spoke once more into the 
microphone with some reservation:

“Andy?”

“That's Ethan alright. Listen, you need to keep him busy while I 
think of something to throw him off course. He might mean well, 
but he can be a very single-minded idiot when he wants to. And 
Nicole?”

“Tell me.”

“Strict radio silence from now on. He mustn't get a whiff.”

“You know me.”

“But you don't know my brother.”

Blood-red dawn

The hills around the monastery blossomed golden under the first 
rays of the sun. The cold, wet night edged away, hiding under the 
jungle's treetops. The bell of the monastery started to ring, 
calling for the morning prayer. A few of the sisters started to 
gather in the small temple, rosemary in hand. Their lips moved at 
a shallow, serene pace, mouthing hymns and eulogies to their God, 
Lord and Savior.

Ethan had been awake before the break of dawn. He was watching 
the small procession from a small, paneless window. The night had 
been small but courteous; nothing but the distant sounds of 
wildlife had bothered him. Again, his sleep was dreamless.

There was a knock on the door; the stars above shone their last 
light for the night. Ludwig stepped hesitantly inside, holding 
two cups of tea; it his way of apologizing. Ethan offered him a 
cigarette in kind. They sat together in the small room. Ethan sat 
upright in his bed cot, Ludwig pulled the single chair. They left 
their cups of tea to slowly cool on the window sill. When the 
break of dawn came they were still silent, trying not to think. 
Ludwig cleared his throat, breaking the uneasy silence:

“We might head back.”

Ethan simply nodded and sipped quietly from his cup. His nostrils 
flared from the aroma, but he said nothing. Ludwig went on:

“We'll talk it over once everyone's awake. I think we should 
press on, otherwise these people would have gone through all this 
for nothing. The rest though are probably scared out of their 
minds.”

“Can you blame them?” said Ethan and stood up, stretching. Ludwig 
continued, tapping his foot nervously, his tone somewhat 
apologetic: “In any case, some should stay behind and help the 
monastery, at the least. It might be just as good as setting up 
camp elsewhere.”

Ethan's response was terse: “Makes sense.” 

“Not a lot of it makes sense to me, Richard. I want to help, but 
this mess..”

“Having second thoughts?” Ethan said, staring blankly at the rose 
red morning sky, hands on his waist.

“Wouldn't you? I mean, after everything is said and done, is it 
worth it? I want to help, these people want to help but.. How can 
anyone weight that? One's own life against another?”

Ludwig gulped down a mouthful of tea greedily. He didn't seem to 
bother that it was still too hot for comfort.

“Did you get enough sleep?”

Ludwig shook his head wearily. Ethan perched himself on the 
window sill and told Ludwig in a very business-like fashion.

“If you want to move on, you need to get past what's happened. If 
you can't, you should head back while we're still not on the deep 
end here. Otherwise, chances are more people will get hurt for 
nothing.”

The doctor nodded in agreement and lit his cigarette. He took a 
few puffs, drew the smoke in deep. He seemed to relax a bit, the 
care lines on his face evening out.

“What.. What about you?” Ludwig asked with just a hint of 
hesitation, as if the answer might not be forthcoming, as it was 
dangerous to know.

“What do you want to know?” replied Ethan while tapping a 
cigarette out of his pack.

“I just think it might be safer if you came along. That's all I 
need to know.”

“I'm going in as far deep as you are willing to go. But at some 
point..” Ethan's voice trailed off as he drew on his smoke 
heavily. Ludwig closed his eyes and nodded before he replied:

“I think I understand.”

Silence ensued between them. The sound of chanting rose suddenly 
out of the temple's open doors just as the first rays of the sun 
melted away the morning haze around the small patches of 
greenery. The heat was building up rapidly; soon they would be 
sweating again. Ethan suddenly turned and looked Ludwig straight 
in the eye. There was a frown on the doctor's face, a mixed 
expression of fear and hope. Ash from his cigarette fell on the 
dirt floor.

“My name's Ethan. I don't think knowing that puts you in any more 
danger than you already are. I mean, you've trod on a minefield 
already,” Ethan said and smiled sheepishly.

Ludwig smiled thinly but genuinely and said to him: “No, I don't 
think it does. I knew when I saw you that you're a good man.”

“You don't want to know the half of it, doctor,” Ethan replied 
and offered his hand. Ludwig smiled, the lines on his face 
wrinkling in a fatherly fashion. As they shook hands, they heard 
a dull but disturbing, faint echoing sound that Ethan recognised 
all too well: a gunshot.

“That can't be good,” said Ethan dryly.

“Gunfire?”

Ethan just nodded and rushed to the doorway to peek outside. He 
could see through the wide open monastery gate. In the distance, 
he could make out a couple of open-top Rovers slowly coming up 
the hill. A barrage of rattling sounds echoed around the hills; 
assault rifles on full auto. They were soon lost behind the first 
turn on the hillside. The gunfire went on, echoing faintly.

“Some kind of firefight,” Ethan said to Ludwig as he reached for 
his backpack.

“Government or rebels?” asked Ludwig with startled apprehension, 
as he took a look for himself.

“Probably neither. Rebels wouldn't be so frivolous with their 
ammo. Government troops would have a column of vehicles, squads 
of men fanned out on the roadside, carriers. That sort of thing.”

“Then who are they? Who's shooting at whom?” asked Ludwig, his 
voice anxious, unsteady.

“That's not really important. It's people we need to run away 
from, right now,” Ethan said as he pulled out a Colt forty-five 
from his backpack and drived home a clip.

“You have a gun?” asked Ludwig, as if he had never imagined he'd 
see one up close. Ethan loaded a bullet in the chamber and 
clicked the safety on. 

“It's American but it'll do nicely. Gather your people and just 
go. Pack nothing, just follow the ravine eastwards till 
nightfall. If all goes well, I'll try and meet up with you by 
morning. If not, wait it out another day before coming back,” 
said Ethan with a grave expression. The echoes of gunfire grew 
apart in time.

“What? That's preposterous, we can't leave everything behind! 
What are you saying?” said Ludwig, arms raised in dubious 
protest. Another rattling sound echoed, this time stronger; 
closer than before. The sound of motors revved up high could be 
heard, faintly but clearly.

“I'm saying these folks are trigger-happy bastards. Can't 
guarantee they'll just take your stuff and leave.”

Ethan felt like he had to shout to make the doctor listen: “
You're wasting time, go! Now!”

Ludwig hesitated for just a single moment, but then ran to the 
door. He barely paused in his stride to ask:

“What about the wounded, and the sisters? What about you?”

Ethan wiped the sweat of his forehead, gun in hand: “I'll sell 
them bastards a front-page story they can't refuse. I'll do my 
best, promise. If it comes to it..” he said and nodded at the 
gun. “Now go!” he shouted. Ludwig nodded and ran off. He could be 
heard rousing people, urging them to put on their boots and just 
follow him. Dumbfounded, groggy voices mixed with the shuffling 
of feet, thuds and protests. From the sound of it though, they 
were on the move.

The gunshots could be heard, growing weaker and further apart. 
The fight was dying out. Ethan packed a couple of clips in an 
ankle pocket. He grabbed his Leica, and tucked the gun away in 
his trousers, behind his back. He went looking for Nicole; he 
knew that his real priority would be to keep the two of them 
alive, if it all came down to that.

The chanting from the church had stopped. A few of the sisters 
were crowded together outside the church doors. They stared 
through the wide open gate at the hazy hillside, as if waiting 
for some sign. Some were praying softly.

The sound of roaring motors had by now become clearly closer. 
Mingled with the sounds of churned dirt and gravel from the 
rovers' tires, it was an uneasy, threatening sound by its own. 
The absence of gunshots meant they were moving up towards the 
monastery again, unhintered.

Nicole rushed outside the small hall where the wounded and the 
sick lay. She was wearing a plain work apron, her hair tied in a 
bun. Ethan saw her then and rushed towards her, his camera 
swinging wildly from the strap around his neck. She barely seemed 
to take notice of him; she was staring at the shabby road and the 
approaching rovers with a cold, crisp fixation. Anger seethed 
clearly through her. Ethan told her with urgency in his voice:

“You need to keep calm. I think I can handle this. Follow my lead 
when you can, and don't just hand over everything. If they sense 
we're scared shitless, they'll stop at nothing. I'll try and sell 
them a news story, front page on the Times. You just stay firm. 
They might want to check up on the infirmary. Let them.”

“Keep calm? That's your advice? Stay firm? What makes you think 
you can talk things over with them? We can't. We can't just talk.”

Ethan was taken aback. It was an unwelcome surprise; he hadn't 
expected her to be so rigid. Feisty was one thing, but not 
playing ball when guns were involved was childish, even stupid 
and possibly lethal.

“Listen, the head doctor is already trying to make a run for it 
in the ravine. They've left everything behind. Maybe all that 
stuff from the caravan will be more than enough to keep them 
satisfied. There's morphine in there and lots of canned -”

“You think they're looking for a fix? And some corn beef? You 
just take care now, Ethan.”

She gave Ethan a cold dismissive look and shook her head 
slightly, disapprovingly. Ethan frowned and was about to say 
something when a rover zipped past the gates haphazardly. A dozen 
men armed with AK-47s rode on the back, most of them wearing 
combat fatigues. Few piece of clothing matched their size, and 
most were certainly at least a size or two larger.

Only a couple of them wore shoddy boots; the rest rode barefoot. 
They had grim, lean faces. They were mostly skin and bones like 
on the edge of starvation, but their red-shot eyes shone with a 
cruel, alarming intensity. In the back of the faded green and 
grey rover lay two dead bodies, the white of their feet marred by 
the red of their blood.

The sisters stood motionless, following the example of the sister 
superior, who was looking at the band of marauding bandits with 
contempt that bordered on hate.

Another rover passed through the gate. It braked badly and skid 
for a few feet on the courtyard dirt. Another ten men, slightly 
yet markedly better fed, better equipped. Some wore sunglasses, 
some berets and caps. Ethan noticed a big brute of a man sitting 
in the co-driver's seat. Once everyone else had jumped off the 
rover, he stepped out. He was wearing spotless combat fatigues as 
if they had just been pressed. He wore the insignia of a Major. 
It was a good thing he didn't seem familiar at all. 

“That's their leader; if we get to him, the rest will follow,” he 
said to Nicole who was eyeing the bandits with seeping, fervent 
anger. She did not answer; she gave Ethan a sharp accusing look 
and simply turned away. The next moment she lost herself inside 
the impromptu hospital room.

Ethan called after her, but she ignored him. It was at that point 
when he attracted the attention of one of the armed men, who 
pointed his rifle at him and shouted something incomprehensible; 
it sounded like Igbo but not a dialect Ethan could understand 
clearly.

Ethan put his hands up and grinned like an idiot, trying to look 
the part of a mildly insignificant, completely harmless fool of a 
journalist. The armed bandit was still aiming the rifle at him, 
shouting incoherently, looking back and forth nervously. Ethan 
thought it could be he was asking 'should I shoot him?'; it could 
be he was asking 'can I shoot him?'. It would've made little 
difference had that been the case though.

The burly man was overlooking the sisters with one hand cradling 
a short-barreled version of an AK-47; the paratrooper version. In 
his hands, it looked little more than a large handgun. He 
motioned with his free hand and half a dozen men fanned out by 
two's, going inside the rooms and halls on the west side of the 
monastery.

The rising heat added to the tension; Ethan was sweating. He was 
hoping Ludwig had gotten everybody out in time; more people would 
mean more problems to solve. He was also hoping Nicole wasn't 
thinking of doing anything stupid. Stupid tended to pile on 
stupid, and that tended to make people end up dead or worse.

He was searching for a sight of her, but to no avail; for the 
first time the thought entered his mind that perhaps she was 
already running away. It wouldn't help him much, but it wouldn't 
make things harder either.

Ethan's self-appointed guard had stopped shouting; now he was 
grinning, showing a cave of a mouth. He was still aiming his gun 
though, and Ethan thought it was time to make his move. He 
shouted, “Look, press!” and pointing at his Leica he reached with 
the other hand at his vest's chest pocket, fumbling for the press 
pass.

The guard instantly drew back the AKs loading arm carefully, 
waiting for Ethan to make the mistake of flinching. For a bunch 
of ragtag bandits, they exhibited quite the streak of a rather 
unexpected professionalism; stupid nervous people with guns 
would've shot him dead. Ethan glanced at the leader who was 
quietly coming his way, while the rest of his men loitered near 
the sisters pointing guns and casting leery glances. That man, 
Ethan thought, was probably the sole reason why these wretches 
behaved themselves almost like soldiers.

The leader approached Ethan pacefully, making sure his insignia 
was prominently visible. He silently reached at Ethan's vest 
pocket and pulled out his press pass, signed and stamped by the 
IPA and the UN in one of the British embassy's cultural attache's 
offices. The leader took a look at it and read aloud with a 
thick, grossly cacophonous accent:

“Richard Owls. London Times. Lost?” he asked with a grin that 
showed perfect white teeth and more than a couple of gold 
casings.

“Just doing a story,” replied Ethan and added “Major, sir,” with 
an afterthought, hoping to feed the man's ego. Indeed he smiled 
when he heard the rank, and offered Ethan his press pass back. He 
took a quick look around him, the sun glinting off his black 
raybans. Whoever the man was, he was turning in a profit, Ethan 
thought. When he spoke again, he wasn't smiling anymore:

“I'm a moody person. Lost two men on the way. Why are you here? 
What's so important about nuns?”

Ethan didn't have a very hard time faking intimidation. The man 
was imposing enough. Reminded him a bit of his friend James, only 
without the redeeming qualities. He replied with some difficulty, 
trying to find the words:

“The missionary work.. Taking care of people in the middle of a 
war. Their stoic manner; really good press back home. Good press 
anywhere, really. Takes the focus away from the british 
involvement, too. Wins points with my editor.” 

The brute looked at him as if examining a weird kind of exotic 
fly; it was a distant, focused stare. “Politics, journalists. 
Same shit, eh?” he said suddenly and laughed out loud all alone, 
his laughter echoing faintly in the relative silence of the 
monastery's courtyard.

“Just doing my job, major, sir,” replied Ethan with a faint 
smile, his eyes still trying to steal a glimpse of Nicole; she 
must've really gone, he thought to himself.

The sisters were huddled close together, as if waiting for a 
verdict on them. The sister superior was eyeing him and the 
leader of the bandits intensely. Maybe she was thinking of doing 
something stupid herself. That would complicate things right when 
he was trying to achieve a sense of rapprochement, if anything 
like that could be achieved with the likes of these people.

“I'm no major, Dick. I'll call you Dick. No Major Yuembe anymore. 
I'm King, King Yuembe!” shouted the so-called Major, triumphantly 
raising both arms in the air. He fired off a couple of shots, 
eliciting a response of wild shots in the air from his men who 
cheered and eyed the sisters with venomous stares. They looked 
barely able to hold themselves; another example in forced 
discipline. He laughed heartily once more, before settling down 
his gaze towards Ethan once more. Ethan pitched the idea of the 
story he had been working on in his mind:

“I think you'd make the perfect story, really. I could show the 
world your living conditions, the way you're defending your 
freedom. Add a bit about your backstory, where you came from, 
what made you quit the army. It'd be a fantastic piece, a world 
first,” Ethan said and aimed the camera at Yuembe. He took on a 
haughty pose like a model, indeed the kind of self-gratifying 
stance photographers tend to think is fit for nobility portraits. 
The camera clicked, and Ethan rolled the film a couple more 
times, taking a few more shots. Then Yuembe yanked the camera off 
its straps suddenly, and Ethan felt his plan wasn't working the 
way it should.

“I'll keep that film. I like pictures; but I don't like the 
publicity. Understand?”

Ethan nodded, frowning warily. He replied carefully:

“No problem. I can see it could hamper your activities; I can do 
a text piece only, full page with stock photos or something,” he 
said, insisting on trying to stroke the man's ego. He knew it 
wouldn't work when the man took the film out of the camera and 
tucked it inside a pocket. He then just threw the camera away, 
breaking the lens. He then asked Ethan, edging his face closer to 
his the way a boxer might before a fight:

“You think we are freedom fighters?” he said through teeth almost 
clenched shut. Ethan's frown became a deep, long furrow. Looking 
distraught and casting glances around him, he looked completely 
at a loss. To complete the show, he said weakly:

“Well, of course.”

Yuembe broke down in laughter and said something in that dialect 
Ethan couldn't quite get. All the men laughed along in earnest, 
pointing at Ethan like a freak exhibit. Maybe writing up a story 
wouldn't hold, but the stupid journalist ploy still had something 
in it, just maybe, Ethan thought to himself.

Some of the men that had been searching around the monastery 
called out, grabbing Yuembe's attention. They had found the 
caravan's Rovers and supplies. Yuembe and his men exchanged a few 
words from a distance, more like shouts. Then he picked a few of 
them by eyeing them alone, motioned with a hand and another half 
a dozen men left their guns behind. Soon they started loading the 
crates with the red cross first onto their own trucks.

The sister superior was talking with some sisters in a low-keyed 
voice; they seemed somewhat relieved. It was beginning to look 
like the bandits would simply loot what they could and leave. 
Organised and disciplined as they seemed to be, they were nothing 
more than dangerous, cruel thieves. 

Yuembe then took out a camo pattern handkerchief and wiped the 
sweat from his brow. He took off his glasses and wiped the lenses 
as well; his round black eyes were big and calm, the eyelashes 
almost delicate. They belonged to a man who should've become an 
artist or a doctor, maybe even a priest. In any case, they didn't 
look like the kind of eyes that belonged to a professional lethal 
parasite.

That grin of his gave him away; Ethan had seen that grin once too 
many. He knew even himself had sported such a grin at times past. 
The thought disturbed him and for a minute he was out of 
character, looking grim and serious all of a sudden. Yuembe saw 
the change on his face; he was instantly intrigued. He looked at 
Ethan from head to toe, scanning him slowly, measuring him. He 
asked him then, hands around his waist, the raybans protruding 
from his chest pocket:

“You do not approve? Wouldn't look good on your story?” he said 
and then made a motion in the air with his free hand, stopping at 
the mention of each word like showing off a neon headline sign: “
Former Nigerian Army Major Pillages Monastery.”

Ethan simply shook his head. Yuembe went on with what he had in 
mind: 

“I am not a man of the press, like you. But I know what spices up 
a story,” he said, winked and nodded towards the sisters who were 
still clutching their rosemaries. Some of them praying on their 
knees, some of them simply staring the men who guarded them 
straight in the eye, as if they thought shame alone could turn 
them away.

“Major, there's nothing more to gain here other than those sacks 
of rice, those crates of medications and the canned food. That's 
all there is,” Ethan said, thinking he should at least try and 
reason with the man, even though he seemed to be toying with 
ideas that went beyond looting.

“Been here long enough, Mr. Owls? Are you sure that's all? Maybe 
you and I have different tastes in things,” Yuembe said with a 
devilish grin and then barked an order.

Another half a dozen men complied and went inside the eastern 
blocks of the monastery. Pretty soon, one of them shouted back 
from the impromptu hospital. Another was holding a vest with a 
red cross painted on it. Some groggy voices and malformed 
protests were put down after a few slaps and kicks laid the 
patients back on their beds for good.

Yuembe shouted back more orders, looking pissed; veins shot from 
his temples and neck. He didn't seem to care about the red cross 
or the infirmary and the people inside. That was good; it mean 
Ludwig and his people were probably safe and not a moment too 
soon. Probably Nicole as well. He had thought she might help him 
sound more convincing, but she was still nowhere to be seen. 
Maybe she'd proved a problem in any case, Ethan thought.

His thoughts where cut short when he suddenly heard a shout from 
one of Yuembe's men, and then saw bloodied pieces of skull bounce 
off a door, the rest of the bandit's body slumping against it a 
flick of an eye later, when the gunshot was heard. A high 
velocity rifle. Though a familiar sound to Ethan, he had been 
more than just surprised to see its effects so vividly at that 
point.

Everyone froze still; it was the sisters panicked shrieks and 
loud prayers that roused everyone back into a frenzied random 
activity. Ethan hesitated; if someone had stayed behind trying to 
be a hero, should he go all out and take a shot at Yuembe right 
now? What about the sisters? They were completely exposed. No, he 
decided he couldn't risk their lives.

Yuembe aimed his AK nervously at Ethan, and shouted at his men 
infuriated. They quickly aimed their guns at windows and 
doorways, covering the rest; a couple of them grabbed the sisters 
by force one by one, and started to tie their hands together.

A couple of sisters tried to resist, spitting and kicking their 
way away. Yuembe's men used the AKs shoulderguards like clubs; 
the nuns suffered. A few cracks were heard; bones were brocken. 
The sister superior's proud facade had collapsed; she was now 
begging the men in whatever dialect ran through her tongue, with 
what few words she knew. Their captors seemed to enjoy their 
work, smiling as they heard the wailings and sobs of the hapless 
sisters. Yuembe shouted on the top of his lungs:

“Come out now and I won't hurt the sisters. I'll let you and them 
live, just as soon as I get what I came for. You and I both know 
I want the-”. His voice became little more than a gurgle as his 
head exploded violently, shrapnel of his skull flying away in all 
directions. His body fell backwards from the overwhelming force 
of the bullet, the AK falling off his limp hand on the ground 
with a thud.

Ethan's eyes were scanning for the shooter while his hands 
instinctively went for his gun. He was already moving towards the 
cover of the nearby arches. There was no hope in hell that he'd 
talk the rest of them out of this: for one thing, he didn't even 
speak that damnable dialect, and for another, they were already 
letting off a blind hail of bullets at the mud-and-hay brick 
walls of the monastery, trying for the shooter. All they 
accomplished though was leave behind large pockmarks on the 
walls, splintered doors and spent bullet casings.

The bandits shouted at each other, confused and dismayed. Some 
looked like they were itching to just shoot the sisters dead. One 
of them cried something like a war shout and let off a single 
round that went through one of the nuns like a hammer through 
ice. The bullet took apart almost her whole left side; blood, 
bone and guts spilled freely through tattered robes. She crumbled 
like a rag doll on the dirt before the church gate, twitches and 
spasms running through her body. Her dying throes were little 
more than a wet cough, deafeningly loud among the silence of the 
sisters.

A man with a beret knocked some teeth out of the shooter with his 
rifle's shoulderguard, rendering him unconscious. The rest fired 
off wild shots at windows, more or less blindly.

The sisters started to weep. The sister superior held her cross 
in hand, tears running down her cheek; still she whispered the 
dead sister's rites softly in her ear.

Another gunshot was heard; it missed a bandit on the back of one 
of the Rovers by an inch. The ricochet bullet grazed him behind 
one ear and caused him to fall on his back down on the ground.

Ethan was now working on instinct and training alone; he would 
pick his targets, going in for the kill. He pulled out his gun 
and rushed towards the rover parked in front of the sisters and 
the church. He silently thanked God and his good fortune that 
Yuembe and his men had fallen for the journalist trick, sloppy 
enough not to bother actually checking him for weapons.

One of Yuembe's men saw him appearing behind one of the arches, 
pacefully coming towards them. He pointed with one hand and 
shouted a warning, instead of shooting. Two rounds went through 
the bandit, and threw him off his feet a couple of feet away. The 
shots left his chest in ruins; his lungs and heart a ruptured 
mess.

Ethan switched targets and went for one of the men wearing a 
beret. He let another couple of rounds fly, the Colt forty-five 
pulsating in his double-action grip with body-shaking force. 
Years of experience and shooting training brought Ethan's aim 
lower to compensate for the recoil; aim slightly below center of 
mass, double-tap the trigger, swing the body and aim another. 
Repeat. It was as easy as riding a bike if one didn't stop to 
think about the killing involved.

As he swung to take down another one, there was a sharp whizzing 
sound. He felt a hot rush of air near the back of his head. He 
turned around to look and saw to his right a man down on the 
ground, trying to grasp his neck with both hands. He bleeding 
profusely, his legs flailing wildly as spurts of blood turned 
into a red fuzzy mist through his fingers.

The shooter was good; a professional from the likes of it. He had 
probably just saved his life, but there wasn't time for allowing 
the thought to cloud his senses. Another bandit appeared from 
behind a half-wrecked window and let off a ripple of bullets from 
his AK. He kept shouting like a crazed madman while shooting, 
aiming at nowhere in particular; the kick of the AK sent the 
bullets plainly at the old, pitted and stained tiled roof, 
breaking away and chipping whole sections.

Still firing away and before emptying his clip, he was blown back 
by the force of two bullets, one hitting him square in the 
stomach and another in his chest. If his heart didn't stop 
outright, he'd have time enough to meet God when his gut wound 
ate his insides.

The sisters were busy untying themselves amidst the confusion. 
They rushed to the inside of the temple, trying to carry their 
dead sister with a modicum of decency. They lifted her up, 
hugging her spilled entrails in their lap.

As they did so, their former captors and guards let off another 
hail of fire from their AKs trying to take Ethan down; they were 
controlled, but badly aimed bursts. Yuembe would have probably 
made good soldiers out of them if it wasn't for their horrid aim 
and their complete lack of cover discipline.

Out in the open with every part of their body exposed and firing 
from the hip, their chances of hitting Ethan laying dirt-low 
behind a series of arches, were slim if not none. Their chances 
became zero when a bullet went through one of them in the 
shoulder; the exit wound was the size of a basketball, turning 
his spine into a shredded ruin.

The other one of the pair kneeled and raised his rifle to take 
aim at the direction of the shooter. Ethan rolled out of cover 
and popped three shots at him; one caught him in the leg, tearing 
up his calf. Another one hit the dirt and the last one went 
through his armpit and neck, cutting an artery open. It left him 
a dying man, unable to even flinch at the scorching sun casting 
its glare at his fading eyes.

Ethan leapt to his feet again and rushed towards the sisters and 
the church, attracting a very unhealthy amount of fire from the 
west wing of the monastery. The bandits that had been on search 
detail there were now laying down covered, taking pot shots 
whenever they thought it was prudent. The shooter had put real 
fear in their hearts.

A couple of those who had left their guns behind to carry sacks 
and crates tried to make a run towards the Rovers for their AKs. 
One of them fell stone dead, leg-first, as if he'd hit his head 
while running, another excellent shot from the unknown shooter. 
His mortal wound was remarkably clean; the bullet had went 
straight through the heart, imploding it and settling down the 
exit velocity to a lot less damaging value. The other one just 
dashed towards a low-walled flower fence and jumped over, 
creeping away back into a semblance of adequate cover.

Ethan went past the church's entrance and saw the sisters hugging 
around the body of their dead one. He grabbed the sister superior 
by one arm, while she was clearly paying no attention to her 
surroundings, her face deathly pale, her eyes without focus. 
Instinctively she tried to shake him off. He caught her stare and 
tried to convey a sense of calm. Panic wouldn't get them 
anywhere; it could only lead to senseless death. He told her then 
while stray shots seemed to edge dangerously close judging by the 
plaster and chipped wood flying around them:

“Lie down, and spread around. Throw the benches for cover. And 
pray, sister!”

She nodded then as if magically awaken from a deep slumber. He 
couldn't help noticing her wrinkled, bloodied face looked 
strangely attractive for someone her age and posture. Ethan bowed 
his head to her hand and whispered “'er grace,'” and then carried 
along. He stood for a few moments by the temple's door. When he 
heard the distinctive bolt-action gunshot of the mysterious 
shooter he decided to sprint away to a better location; one of 
the rovers.

He placed three shots at the windows up on high on the western 
edge while running. He wasn't hoping on actually hitting 
anything, but he was sure these guys would instinctively duck 
when they heard the shots, sparing him a precious couple of 
seconds to make a more or less safe passage. He'd heard the gun 
go empty; he'd need a chance to reload soon.

When he reached the Rover, he saw the flash of a scope barely 
visible near the church bell tower. He couldn't make out who it 
was; the sun was still rising directly behind him, blinding those 
who dared to take a shot. Clever, natural cover. Still, down on 
the courtyard from near the makeshift hospital, two more of the 
late Major Yuembe's men appeared, firing on full auto towards the 
bell tower as they went.

Those on the western dormitories felt like contributing, so they 
popped out of their covers and placed single shots against the 
bell tower, rather blindly. The shooter let one shot fly; the 
cracking echo of the bolt-action came right after the thud of the 
dead body on the ground. But no other shots followed.

Ethan peeked from behind the Rover; the other man was still on 
the courtyard, nervously trying to find cover while surveying the 
rooftop for the shooter. Those on the west side had no clear 
target, and decided to take their chances at Ethan and the Rover.

He switched the empty clip with a new full one; if this kept for 
much time longer he'd need to pick one of the AKs lying all 
around for himself. A cacophony of bullets ricocheting off thick 
metal engulfed him; the Rover's thick metal chassis was as good a 
cover as any. It wasn't impervious, but it was good enough for 
such a tight spot. Maybe half a dozen men took shots at him from 
the western dormitories; perhaps more lurked somewhere in the 
eastern wing. Worse still, the unknown shooter had been forced to 
reposition. Less cover for him then for another couple of 
minutes.

Ethan slithered slowly towards the front of the Rover. The engine 
block would provide better cover. As he did so, he kept his gun 
trained towards the eastern rooms. If a head or a gun popped from 
somewhere out there, he'd simply squeeze.

He then suddenly saw the one that had come running towards the 
bell tower underneath the first Rover, trying to aim his AK at 
him while flat on the dirt. Ethan thought he saw him grinning but 
he wasn't sure; he simply brought his Colt in front of him and 
fired three shots in rapid succession; the man let off his own 
shot but the sight of Ethan's gun alone opposite him was enough 
to let his aim stray.

Still, the bulled grazed Ethan slightly over his left shoulder; 
his third shot went wild and punctured a tire. The second and 
first though went through the man's neck and spine. He lay there 
under the Rover, paralyzed and bleeding, choking on his own 
blood.

A small pin-prick of a flash made Ethan turn around, gun in hand 
ready to shoot. As the blinding light turned away from his face 
for a moment, he saw more clearly now the unknown shooter. The 
gun was an M1903 bolt-action, sniper variant with scope. And the 
shooter was, much to Ethan's surprise, noone else but Nicole.

He didn't have time to think about that revelation for long; 
another hail of wild gunfire forced her aside, behind a thick 
wide arch. He heard indinstinct shouts in that unknown dialect, 
and then more gunshots were heard. None of them landed anywhere 
near him or Nicole. He sacrificed some cover for a better view, 
quickly scanning for targets. He couldn't see any. He decided to 
make a move then. He shouted:

“Nicole! Cover me!”

He sprang up then and ran without aiming his gun. He just run 
towards the west wing; a single shot was heard. One of the 
bandits wanted to take the opportunity against Ethan, but 
Nicole's aim had proven a lethal discouragement for anyone else 
as well.

When Ethan reached the low-walled fence, he jumped over it and 
rolled sideways. He scanned aft and fore and saw noone. The 
Rovers were still sitting there, half-loaded with the caravan's 
supplies. Behind him, a flimsy wooden staircase led to the upper 
floor. There were pools of blood dripping down the staircase, and 
traces of wounded bodies being drawn inside rooms.

He looked in Nicole's direction. She was giving him a thumbs up. 
He went inside each room methodically, pushing the door open and 
then peeking inside before rushing inside in a crouch. He saw 
bodies of Yuembe's men. Most were shot in the back. Two of them 
had shot each other, their bodies laying against opposite walls. 
It seemed to Ethan like the paper-thin veneer of what little 
comradeship and professionalism these bandits seemed to exhibit 
crumbled when Yuembe's head got blown off. Their panic and their 
petty squabbles had undone them completely. Some might've fled on 
foot, but they've left no reason behind to return.

The search on the upper rooms yielded the bodies of those who had 
felt lucky or proficient enough to take down Ethan or Nicole. 
When he felt it was safe, Ethan shouted from an open wound to 
Nicole, “All clear!”. She gave a thumbs up and disappeared back 
into the infirmary.

What a firefight, Ethan thought while overlooking the courtyard 
from that higher vantage point. He began counting bodies without 
even being conscious of it, and then he saw one of the bodies was 
actually moving towards the church, gun in hand. His raised his 
gun to aim clearly and fired away without his usual control; the 
bandit though still had time enough to let off a ripple of fire 
before the bullets struck home.

He slumped down on his knees, and fell face down on the dirt, 
blood oozing around him. Ethan ran down the staircase shouting at 
the top of his lungs:

“Nicole! Check the church!”

As he did so, Nicole had already reappeared, this time with a 
Beretta in hand; she moved along hugging the walls with all the 
care in the world.

Ethan could see the sunlight etching shadows inside the church, 
but not a shadow that moved. As he came closer he yelled:

“Sisters! Sister Superior! Is everyone alright?”

As he reached the church door, he saw a the trembling figures of 
a few of the sisters. Some of them sat still, frozen in shock. 
Two of them lay down, around a pool of blood. One of them was the 
sister superior; her sisters had closed her eyes, and covered her 
with cloth from the Holy Table. The other sister was a young 
thing, perhaps the younger of them all. She was lying in front of 
the sister, her body mangled horribly; she had thrown herself in 
the way of the bullets but that had not been enough. It never 
really is, Ethan thought almost cynically.

Nicole was breathing laboriously when she came next to Ethan. He 
spared a glance at her, but said nothing. As her breathing 
returned to normal, she lowered her Beretta and slumped herself 
against a large wooden chair, drenched in sweat and dirt. She had 
the smell of gunpowder about her.

One of the nuns, still bent over the sister superior's body 
turned and asked Ethan with a croaky voice:

“Is it over?”

He nodded almost absent-mindedly. Then he turned to look at 
Nicole and asked her with a deep frown and an almost unforgiving 
stare:

“I thought you would do something stupid.”

She shook her head, and looked him squarely in the eye. He saw 
the truth behind that glazed look and those weary words, when she 
said:

“Have some decency. Let's talk outside if you must.”

Ethan nodded, made the sign of the cross and walked outside 
towards the Rover. The sun was starting to fill most of the 
courtyard. As the adrenaline rush weared off, the smell of blood 
and gunpowder assaulted his nostrils. He tried not to inhale too 
deeply and focused his stare on the church tower, ridden with 
bullet marks. He heard something drop behind him; he turned and 
saw Nicole on her knees, heaving her guts. He fought the 
compulsion to do so as well.

He approached her and helped on her feet. She got up and tucked 
the Beretta in one of her pockets, and walked to a water basin on 
a wall recess near the church. Ethan followed close behind her. 
He noticed she had a slightly limp gait; she was hurt. He asked 
her:

“Bullet grazed your leg?”

She shook her head and said without turning:

“No, sprained ankle probably.”

“Where did you learn to shoot like that?”

She shrugged and cupped her hands full of water from the basin. 
She washed her mouth and spat in the dirt before she replied:

“Algiers.”

“You mean, the Battle of Algiers?” Ethan said as if finding it 
difficult to grasp. 

She nodded slowly and leaned her back on the wall, and untied her 
hair. The grit and sweat had turned them into a mess. She looked 
at him with a weary smile and replied:

“That's where I lost my faith, Ethan.”

He looked at her with puzzlement. He asked her then:

“I mean, how?”

“It so happened the aid station I was volunteering got in the 
way. For two nights, we had to fight for our lives. Every able 
bodied man and woman,” she said, folding her hands together.

Ethan shook his head and bit his lip. He took a look around him 
and then gazed at the church as if it were miles away. He said to 
Nicole then, his voice carrying a thoughtful tone:

“So you've got your own share, then.”

“My share of what, Ethan? My share of blood and guts?” she 
retorted with a flush of anger.

He looked at her through a flutter of his eyes and said with a 
shallow, gritty voice:

“Your share of guilt.”

Her face softened and the edges of her lips fell flat. She stood 
away from the wall for a moment, and then started walking past 
Ethan towards the infirmary. He watched her as she put a hand in 
her eye, wiping away a tear. He then looked at the church and the 
bell tower before closing his eyes and letting the warm sun touch 
his face, inch by inch.

Heed no prayer

Ludwig was sweating profoundly, slowly packing small boxes of 
essential medicine onto one of the Rovers. The sun had begun its 
descent beyond the surrounding hills, but the heat and moisture 
was intolerably unabated. Ethan was helping Nicole load the 
wounded Red Cross people in two of the Rovers.

The patients from the infirmary would ride in the open-top Rovers 
the bandits had left behind. Two of them needed a stretcher, bad 
cases of malaria. The rest were mostly kids, left to fend on 
their own.

Though bullet-ridden and shoddy-looking the Rovers worked fine; 
they would have to do. Ethan needed to keep just one of the Red 
Cross Rovers. Ludwig had indulged him without pausing to think 
about it; for all it mattered, he had saved their lives. 

The sisters, fourteen souls left in all, would ride along with 
the caravan carrying their meagre belongings. They were leaving 
little of real value behind them. As they climbed inside the back 
of the Rovers, Ethan took a moment to watch them intently. Nicole 
had just stopped for a smoke. He turned and told her then with a 
flat, calculating expression:

“Look at them. Three of them dead. Vacant stares, hollow gazes. 
Still, they keep their rosemaries in hand, muttering prayers. 
Will that make them feel better about it?”

She let a small cloud of smoke hazily drift away from her as she 
sat with her back against the Rover's door, legs crossed at her 
ankles, one hand in her apron's pocket. She smiled thinly before 
she replied:

“Maybe they're thankful for being alive. Maybe they're mourning. 
Leave the poor women be. Does everything have to make sense to 
you?”

He crossed his arms in front of his chest and cast a thoughtful 
gaze towards the small graveyard where only a couple of hours ago 
they had buried the three sisters, alongside the bandits. The 
surviving nuns had insisted on it. He shook his head 
absent-mindedly then and said:

“It never really does. I'm only saying, how can they go on after 
what's happened?”

She laughed with a bitter crease around her lips and replied:

“It's people just like them that do go on. Faith, remember? I've 
talked to their new superior. She's decided to dissolve the 
order. I'm not sure she can really do that on her own, but she 
seemed quite resolved. Each will have to go her own way. She 
probably thinks it'll help them heal over time.”

Ethan was looking at the nuns' faces; they were too pale for the 
likes of the Nigerian sun anyway, he thought to himself.

“Maybe they will, maybe they won't. But just going on pretending 
they're stronger than they really are..”

He let his voice trail off, shaking his head in disbelief. Nicole 
was about to say something when they both saw Ludwig approaching 
them, wiping his forehead and arms from the sweat in vain; in a 
minute he'd be sweating once more. He nodded to Nicole and 
smiled, but turned to talk to Ethan, slightly out of breath:

“We're ready. We should be at Lagos by morning. Once we do get 
back on the tarmac, we'll notify the Lagos office about what 
happened, head straight for the hospital.”

“How's everyone?”

“The wounded are stable. Everyone's shaken, closed to themselves 
mostly. Some are still scared. Even needed sedation,” said the 
doctor and shrugged somehow apologetically. Ethan simply nodded. 
The doctor continued:

“I can't thank you enough for what you've done really. We could 
actually hear the gunfight, but we kept running, just like you 
said. The sisters said you had some help.”

He looked at Nicole sideways then but he was smiling gently, his 
eyes gleaming softly. Nicole shuffled as if feeling uncomfortable 
and said to the doctor without looking back:

“Not that much there, really.”

Ethan placed a kind hand on the doctor's shoulder but before he 
could speak, Ludwig let out a snort of a laugh and said:

“I get it Ethan. When we get back, I'll need to file a report; an 
enquiry will ensue. Perhaps I'll be charged. Then I expect 
there'll be some uproar from the embassies, the press. People 
will hear about this, certainly.”

Ethan's gaze for a moment turned sour while Nicole shot a worried 
glance at Ludwig but he went on, this time with a somber look on 
his face:

“I know what you're thinking. The minefield, the bandits. The 
sisters getting killed. People's memories do become jarred from 
experiences like these. Frankly, some genuinely don't recall 
there even was a journalist along. And the sisters, well.. Poor 
souls have a lot on their minds now. Not to mention there's a war 
going on.”

Ethan nodded, grinning shamelessly. Though the cloak and dagger 
routine had largely lost its meaning now that the caravan was 
turning back, the doctor had turned out to be a welcome though 
strange and unlikely ally. He extended a hand, which the doctor 
promptly gripped. Ethan then said:

“I take it you'll cover for me,” he said before turning to look 
at Nicole and adding “For us, anyway. Thanks, Ludwig.”

Nicole nodded half-heartedly, while the doctor replied:

“The way things turned out I should be thanking you, Ethan. I'm 
convinced that without you, we'd be dead or maybe worse.”

The doctor shook Ethan's hand and looked him in the eye with a 
sobering, stone-hard gaze. The lifeless mangled bodies of the 
three dead nuns came unbidden to his mind then and he was unable 
to meet Ludwig's stare. He nodded limply and the doctor caught 
him by the arm, telling him reassuringly:

“Look, you saved lives. That's what matters in my line of 
business. Save as many as you can.”

“I know Ludwig. It's just that..”

Ethan hesitated; he felt unable to find the right words. Nicole 
jumped in, a dull expression on her face, her voice a gritty 
affair:

“You feel sorry for them?”

He turned to look at her with bewildered puzzlement. He asked her 
with evident confusion:

“You mean the sisters? Of course, I mean -”

“Saving the world now?” she said with a vicious stare that marred 
her features. She almost spat out the words.

Ethan blinked furiously while Ludwig simply stood there. They 
felt something they had said had ticked off Nicole.

“Listen, Nicole, I understand you -” he managed to blurt before 
she cut him mid-sentence and said “I don't need your 
understanding!” before leaving them flabbergasted to watch her 
briskly pace towards her guestroom. Ethan made a motion to follow 
her but Ludwig reached an arm and blocked his path:

“It won't help. She's grieving. Try not to make it harder,” said 
Ludwig, rearranging his glasses slowly. Ethan turned to say 
something as if in protest, but he simply stood there, facing her 
way. He said to the doctor then:

“That's not at all like her. I mean, I barely know her, but I 
wouldn't think she'd take all this that hard.”

Ludwig shook his head and looked Ethan straight in the eye; 
despite their height difference he managed to sound like a 
teacher scolding a schoolboy:

“People died here today! Did you expect everyone to move along as 
if nothing out of the ordinary had happened? Business as usual?”

The doctor was almost glaring at Ethan, who cooly replied in a 
low, calm voice:

“There is a war going on. I wouldn't exepct that from everyone, 
but she's seen war. She knows what it's like and I believe that. 
It's just.. odd. I mean, she's acting odd. She killed maybe half 
or more of the bandits.”

Ludwig frowned and his forehead wrinkled, beads of sweat trailing 
his temples. He opened his mouth to speak, and almost stuttered 
the words:

“She killed?”

Ethan simply nodded and fixed his gaze at Nicole's guestroom, his 
face a pensive, blank wall. The doctor spoke again:

“How?”

“Does it matter to you?”

“No, not really.”

“I thought so as well. Though I think I need to know wherever 
we're going.”

“You're planning to take her with you?”

Ethan nodded, hands on his waist. Ludwig asked with some 
reluctance:

“Then you two are..” he said, letting his voice trail rather 
uncomfortably. Ethan blinked and smiled somewhat lamely with a 
frown upon his face before shaking his head furiously. He told 
the doctor then:

“Good God, no. That kind of woman would be the death of me. 
Besides..”

“Not the time?”

Ethan shrugged and said:

“She's taken.”

“Ah. I wouldn't think you'd draw such a line.”

Ethan grinned despite himself and asked with a mocking tone:

“I'd say! A gentleman like meself, getting frisky with a lady in 
wedlock! Absurd!”

Ludwig shook his head with no hint of good humor other than a 
slight curl of his lip. He then wiped the sweat on his forehead 
with one sleeve, while he said to Ethan rather flatly:

“How can you joke about anything after all this?”

Ethan thought about it for a moment and then said rather 
mirthlessly:

“Won't kill us now, will it?”

Ludwig looked at him with a pondering expression. Before he could 
reply, one of his staff shouted out for his attention. He gave a 
thumbs up; the engines of the Rovers roared into life one after 
the other. They were heading back. He then simply said to Ethan 
with a shrug:

“Well, thanks again. And good luck. Maybe we'll meet again in a 
better place and time.”

“There's always Heaven, doctor,” said Ethan with a shallow grin. 
The doctor shook his head, backtracked a few steps and then 
started jogging towards the open door of a waiting Rover. When he 
climbed aboard, he had one last glimpse of Ethan lighting a 
cigarette, and waving them goodbye.

* * *

The moon was waxing low on the night sky. Its white sheen 
sometimes came through muddied through the wispy clouds that 
toiled lazily past it. And when the cool wind blew the murky 
clouds away, the shapeless shadows that covered everything below 
vanished within a swath of summer moonlight that could easily 
lure a man into thinking all was well in the world.

Such trappings of the mind were not new to Ethan; he'd seen first 
hand what such a serene, beguiling night could do to a man. 
Guards stabbed from behind inside their trenches, patrolmen lying 
dead on the ground, their throats slit open - their still warm 
blood misting in the chilly night air. The sudden feeling of a 
hand on his shoulder electrified him at first, and then sent a 
numbing sensation that grew all along his right side down to his 
hip.

He looked around as if in a dream, half-waiting for the thrust of 
a bayonet through his jugular. It was Nicole; the thought of how 
the hell she'd slipped behind him unnoticed sprang inside his 
mind. It was unnerving, more so for a soldier and doubly so for a 
Scout of the Royal Marines. `Damn her!', he thought while he saw 
her grinning as if she'd had intended to catch him off-guard. Her 
voice sounded rather casual, but there was the barest glint of 
mischievous success about it:

“Did I startle you?”

There was a small moment of uncomfortable silence, before Ethan 
managed to answer:

“Well, yes. Yes, you did. Have you packed? We should set out now, 
if we want to reach LALA in the morning. Are you sure about these 
people you mentioned?”

She looked at him with a frown. The light of the oil lamp inside 
the room flickered around her face as if it danced to a rhythm of 
its own. She replied with a hurt tone, as if taken aback:

“Are you suggesting that they can't be trusted?”

He got up from his chair and moved away from the way, his back 
resting against the dimly lit wall. He crossed his arms as if 
feeling threatened and said flatly:

“I'm suggesting something's off. I'm suggesting this is all too 
much.”

Her face grew distant suddenly. She tilted her head and bit her 
lip before saying with a clear, hearty voice:

“You were the one who insisted on going back there for Andy. And 
I should thank you for that. It's just that.. I'm doing all I 
can!”

Her face became contorted and it looked as if she was about to 
break down into sobs and cries for barely a moment. But she held 
on and said sharply:

“I risked my life back there. I could've left, I could've run 
away. I did for the sisters, I tried. But I did it for Andy, and 
you as well.”

“Now that's what's bugging me,” replied Andy, stabbing a pointing 
finger her way. He went on with an even, accusing tone of voice:

“You're not just good with a rifle: you're an excellent shot. You 
didn't hesitate, you actually went inside and picked up that 
M1903. And by the way, that's not exactly a Derringer. Neither is 
that Beretta. I mean, I'm not ungrateful or anything, but just 
how the fuck did you get hold of those? And since when does one 
become such a pro with a couple of weeks of fighting? Who the 
hell are you, really now?”

Nicole looked at him sternly at first for an itchy moment that 
faintly smelled of danger, but then her face dissolved in a 
small, tight smile abruptly. As if she could relax now, she sat 
down on the cot across the small table and the oil lamp and said 
to Ethan with a weird, all too american accent:

“I guess you're not the only one playing in the shadows here, 
Ethan. My real name is Nicole Heurgot; but I'm Agency.”

Ethan eyes fluttered violently of their own volition. His hand 
went instinctively to the Colt laying reassuringly behind his 
back, but Nicole urged him:

“No, no. I mean I'm CIA. Please, that's not necessary. Really, 
we're in this together. I really am Andy's wife. It's just too 
darn complicated. He doesn't really know who I work for. Never 
did. In a way, I am to blame for what's happened to him.”

She looked downcast, glancing at Andy, waiting for some kind of 
explosion on his side, some kind of reproach or exclamation that 
never came. Instead, he sat back down on the chair and looked at 
Nicole as if she was barely there.

“CIA?”

She nodded slowly. Ethan took a small liquor bottle out of a 
chest pocket, opened it and had a swig. He barely grimaced while 
the Littlemill ran down his throat, and asked tersely:

“Some kind of mission, then?”

She nodded with some reluctance this time. Her face was 
withdrawn, almost expressionless but for the small, wordless 
movements of her mouth. Ethan gulped down a mouthful of 
Littlemill and almost yelled incredulously:

“A yank? A bloody yank? You're telling me my brother's married to 
a bloody yank spy?”

Nicole was staring at him without really knowing what to say. She 
half-smiled as if out of politeness and pressed the question 
somehow lamely:

“Maybe it's a lot, but why not?”

Then Ethan broke into a fit of laughter that completely surprised 
Nicole, adding:

“He's going to ask for a divorce when he finds out, you know. I'm 
not one for breaking up a marriage, but when I do tell him - and 
I will, mind you - the poor fellow will be demolished. Does he at 
least know you're a yank?”

“He does. We were married in Louisiana, actually.”

“That's were you're from then?”

She nodded briskly and added: “Close by. Trois Rivieres.”

“Kind of makes sense. What about Algiers? Horseshit?” he asked 
avidly. She replied with a nod and added:

“Mostly. I was simply posted there when it went down.”

“So where did you learn to shoot like that?”

“You know, it does feel kind of liberating to talk about all this 
like we're having a dinner party around Langley, but I'd have to 
say I'm not at liberty to discuss it.”

“So now what, you're trying to be professional for a change? You 
could've killed me back there and I'd be still thinking the 
night's just the thing. Your mission involved Andy?”

She raised an eyebrow at that and said nothing. Instead, she got 
up from the cot and said to Ethan, her hands in her pockets:

“I'm not at liberty to discuss that either.”

Ethan's grin was replaced by a taut line over his pursed lips. He 
sat straight on his chair and said with a hint of vehemence:

“Horseshit. This isn't about the job; any job. It's about Andy. 
You said it might've been your fault he's missing now. Was he 
part of the mission?”

She gripped her elbows as if a sudden chill had emptied her body 
of any warmth. She couldn't hide the fact she felt uncomfortable. 
He told him then with some reticence:

“He.. He was my cover. The caravan, was my cover. I know, the 
irony?” she said raising a hand dismissively and went on: “But 
half the world knows the Red Cross is just another part of the 
deal. Andy thought he'd convinced me we were doing the right 
thing. In a way, I didn't need much convincing.”

Ethan let out a long breath, and stared at Nicole for an 
uncomfortable, long moment. She didn't seem eager to challenge 
his mood. At length, he asked her:

“What happened? I mean, what really happened?”

“It really was bandits. More like, the FPLB.”

“The what?”

“The Frontiere Populaire pour la Liberation de Biafra.”

“Secessionists?”

“Formerly. They'd been convinced to turn their interests in more 
lucrative affairs.”

“Running guns. Information. A little mercenary work.”

Ethan's eyes trailed Nicole's face. There was a strange glitter 
about them, an icy glow that rendered his gaze keen like a knife. 
He seemed to scrutinise her features one by one, when he finally 
said:

“You were their handler. The middleman.”

She stared blankly at the wall for a moment before bowing her 
head and sighing. She clasped her hands together and said softly, 
almost indelibly:

“Yes.”

“And Andy knew shit.”

She nodded with closed eyes. Ethan went for his pack of 
cigarettes, shaking his head furtively. She then cleared her 
throat and added very business-like:

“There's more to it. The guns.”

“You mean the rifle and the Beretta?”

She nodded shallowly. Her face suddenly grew darker than the ill 
lamplight could account for:

“There's more where that came from.”

“Sure. You've got connections, right? You must have had some form 
of backup.”

“There's a small net. But that's not where I got the guns.”

Ethan's eyes became narrow at first. When the fear of realisation 
began to hit home, his eyes bulged even as he lit his cigarette. 
The tip of the cigarette grew glowing red-hot and he asked 
through a small fog of smoke:

“Not here.”

She nodded hesitantly before adding:

“That's what Yuembe came for.”

Ethan's face became flush suddenly, barely contained anger in his 
voice with just the slightest hint of worry:

“They're still here then? The guns are still here. Fuckall!”

With a rather glum attempt at sounding sheepish, Nicole added 
flatly:

“We should get going. There might be more groups interested in 
the cace.”

Ethan grabbed his knapsack and cocked his Colt, before darting 
outside the door towards the Rover and saying rather furiously 
mostly to himself:

“What a fucking catch, Andy! What a brilliant fucking catch!”

Ethan had driven for the better part of the night mostly in 
silence. What little words they had exchanged were about 
directions, miles, maps and compasses. He had tried to make their 
journey shorter, sometimes picking a dirt road or trail, and some 
times ploughing through the savannah head on.

They'd seen pin-pricks of light in the distance blinking on and 
off in their path; the creatures of the night cleared a path in 
their wake. It was mostly hyenas they saw, as well as owls. Each 
time the hyenas saw the Rover's headlights they paused in the 
feast of the carcass and gazed with eyes like gems; then they 
carried on, the instinct of fear quite outdone by hunger.

Ethan thought that had it been any other time their improvised 
journey through the plains and the hills of Nigeria might've been 
quite fascinating; a proper night safari, a peek at the pure, 
wild Africa, untouched by man. But that was just a passing idea; 
so much had happened in so little time, that Ethan found it at 
times difficult to focus on simply driving, his mind racing in 
all sorts of different directions. 

At some point he had felt the need to sleep but carried on for an 
hour or so as if his life dependent on it. Nicole had kept silent 
all along. She sometimes dozed off even as the Rover rocked and 
rumbled over crests and gutters, hilly sides and gravel trails. 
She didn't seem to share the same fatigue as Ethan, who kept 
straightening himself up, breathing sharply in an effort to stay 
awake no matter what. At length, while on a small dirt road beset 
with tall savvanah grass, she asked him:

“Let me drive.”

Ethan rolled his eyes before settling them on her face while his 
mouth widened slowly into a grin:

“I think not,” he said, and yawned.

“You'll fall asleep on the wheel if you go on like this. You need 
to get some rest,” she said, looking worried. Ethan glanced at 
her sideways and kept driving, seemingly about to pass out in any 
moment. He shook his head drowsily without replying. Nicole 
insisted:

“Look, if you won't let me drive at least pull over and get some 
sleep. For God's sake.”

Ethan drew a deep breath and shook himself trying to stay alert. 
He told her then without taking his eyes off the road, his voice 
shallow, almost resigned:

“Fine. Remember, check your compass and clock; stick to the 
zig-zag on the map and we should be fine. Give me one hour, then 
wake me up. Understood?”

Nicole's eyes rolled ever so slightly; that had sounded like an 
order. She replied with a raised eyebrow with evident irritation:

“I understand you don't trust me yet, and that's clearly wrong 
because we're doing this together whether you planned it, like it 
or not. It's about Andy, remember?”

Ethan braked gently then and brought the rover to a stop. He 
closed his eyes and sat with fists clenched on the wheel, 
breathing shallowly. “I remember,” he said and went on looking at 
Nicole through bloodshot eyes:

“Just don't bloody fuck this up. We need to reach the outskirts 
of Onitsha very much alive and completely unseen if at all 
possible. If you see or hear something just -”

“Look, I'm not a hapless bitch you can just work around, alright? 
Jesus, you think you're so hot stuff don't you? Please shut up, 
and sleep,” she said loudly but without screeching or yelling. 
Her somewhat pale face was flush with a red tint of anger, locks 
of her hair stuck on her temples. Ethan strangely thought about 
how menacingly beautiful she looked then.

He smiled thinly, nodded to himself and got out of the Rover as 
sharp as he could, straining himself to get to the co-driver's 
seat as fast as possible. When they crossed each other in front 
of the Rover, they exchanged a strange look, and almost halted 
their stride for the barest second. A few moments later, Nicole 
was behind the wheel while Ethan lay in the seat next to her, 
arms crossed and legs drawn together, snoring like a hog.

They'd been carving a criss-cross path towards Onitsha, the 
gateway to the Biafran territory east of the Niger. The small 
city had been swapping hands for the past few months between the 
federal government and the Biafrans. For the past couple of 
months, it lay in government hands, considered marginally safer. 
Still, the frontline was in an almost constant flux; units from 
both sides would occasionally try and force their passage over 
the Niger. It would come as no big surprise to Ethan if they 
suddenly encountered Biafran patrols instead of government 
troops.

As the hours went by, the savvannah gave way to the lush 
riverside, full of mangroves and thick, green bush. The last of 
the starry sky shone its deep blue light. For a moment, it felt 
as if the rover was wading through a dreamscape, the primal 
Africa of the spirit fathers and the blessed mother Earth. The 
illusion quickly melted away as the primrose red dawn cowardly 
crept over the horizon. Ethan sat upright startled, his arms 
still tightly hugging his chest. He glanced around sharply and 
asked Nicole:

“What time is it?”

She glanced at her wristwatch without taking her hands off the 
wheel and told him:

“It's almost six in the morning. We should be there in about an 
hour.”

“What?” he said slighty miffed and took another look around him. 
He closed his eyes for a moment and looked at her viciously:

“You're on the road. I told you, to stay off the road. What if-”

“What if we're on the road? Wouldn't it look even more strange if 
someone saw us just wading through the savvanah like on a safari? 
For Pete's sake, act like it.”

“Like what? A bloody fool?”

She stared blankly at the road and replied calmly with a vehement 
gaze:

“Like Andy's brother. You're all too tied up in playing the 
professional, while in fact you're just winging this, aren't you?”

Ethan let out a laugh of surprise despite himself. He was at a 
loss for words for a few moments, and Nicole went on:

“Maybe you're too scared. You'd be an idiot if you weren't, but 
at this rate..”

“So you're the expert? Some kind of superhero? Does the CIA 
brainwash their own agents as well?”

Nicole shook her head and scoffed. She said with a flat, nearly 
emotionless voice:

“Maybe.”

Ethan did not answer. He was simply staring at her intently, as 
if searching for something on her face. She took notice and asked 
him:

“What now?”

Ethan rested his head on his hand and let out a sigh. He shrugged 
and told her:

“I'm just trying to see what Andy saw in you, that's all.”

A smirk appeared on her face suddenly and she replied as if 
flustered:

“None of your business.”

“No, thank God not.”

* * *

“London Times?” asked the young lieutenant at the checkpoint. He 
was squinting under the bright morning sun, a pair of sunglasses 
tucked away neatly in his shirt pocket. Ethan replied 
nonchalantly:

“It's a newspaper. Press?” he said, and showed off a battered, 
smudged, laminated press pass with his photo on it. The young 
lieutenant stared back for barely a moment before nodding to 
Nicole. He asked them:

“Red Cross nurse? All alone out here?”

“I'm doing a story arc. Ms. Heurgot here is the centerpiece, you 
see,” Ethan said and looked at her with a thin smile. She barely 
glanced back at the lieutenant with an uncertain smile, 
pretending to feel awkward. He shook his head and without a word, 
waved at the guard to raise a shoddy, rust-ridden metal bar. 
Ethan gave a mock salute and thanked him, while Nicole started 
the engine and drove off slowly towards the bridge.

After a few yards Ethan looked back through the mirror, and saw 
the lieutenant still shaking his head; he noticed a smile and 
then a few laughs from the guards. He was joking; that was good. 
That meant they thought they were probably crazy; which wasn't 
that far off from reality. Nicole asked him then:

“They're lax. It's like they think it's just another job.”

Ethan laid back in his seat and lit a smoke. He told her then as 
they crossed the bridge, the rover bucking slightly at each 
segment, his head lolling freely:

“Well, isn't it?”

She spared a frowned a look lazily before replying and shifting 
gear:

“I like to think it's a lot more. I'm a bit surprised you seem 
so..” She paused mid-sentence, her mouth half-open.

As the Rover reached the other side, a guard motioned them to 
stop. A soldier sitting inside a small shack that offered some 
relatively comfortable shadow was noting down their plates, 
cross-checking it against some sort of list. Nicole found the 
word she'd been searching for and said:

“Jaded.”

Ethan replied after a heavy draught:

“I thought you'd say cynical.”

“I would, if you were.”

“But I am.”

“No, you're not. You care.”

“How do you know?”

“So you do?”

He smiled thinly and tapped away the ash from his cigarette over 
the open window. He shook his head and said with half a smile:

“Well played, I'll give you that.”

“You think this is a game then?”

“Oh, do drive on.”

She smiled wearily and once the guard waved them on their way, 
she sped towards the center of the city through the main road. 
They both peered through open windows at the strange mix of 
people, land and buildings that seemed so impossibly jarring to 
the eye. Red brick walls looked inherently unable to hold even 
the smallest tin roof, while the people around them went about 
their morning business dressed in all sorts of colours from the 
drab gray shirt to the colourful rainbow woolen tunics.

Goats were being herded in pairs by the equivalent of a milkman, 
and quite a small crowd of mostly women and children seemed to be 
waiting in line expectantly. Small groups of soldiers seemed to 
be dispersed along the road, idly but warily overlooking the 
passers-by.

They were driving alongside the river, the east bank on their 
left. Little by little the rural outskirts gave way to more and 
more concrete, more and more colour. The town seemed relatively 
intact from the fighting, but the unmistakable signs were there: 
bullet-ridden blue and red walls, makeshift barricades and gun 
posts mingled with food stalls and workshops. The people seemed 
to take things in their stride. Whatever else, they still lived 
there.

They drove past the harbor and the piers where the military 
presence was more than evident: stores of supplies seemed to be 
piling up, while barges slowly waded through the Niger, loaded to 
the brim. Nearby, fishermen were preparing their nets as they did 
every day. Nicole broke the silence first:

“Isn't it amazing?”

“What, exactly?”

“This town has been exchanging hands ever since the war started, 
and there are still people living here. Not only that, they're 
going about their business like nothing's changed.”

Ethan snorted almost derisively, and with his gaze fixed on the 
golden reflections of the sun on the river, he replied:

“Well, what would you know. A spy with a conscience.”

She looked at him with a knowing smile, while they drove past a 
small square that had been reduced to patches of brush and wild 
grass. She retorted:

“Does it surprise you?”

“It surprises me you can afford one.”

“I'd have no meaning if I wasn't doing this for a reason.”

“It doesn't really have much of a meaning. And there's millions 
of reasons, but try as you might, there's no meaning.”

“So, everything is meaningless, so we should just do nothing 
about everything? Maybe jump off a cliff as well.”

“No, I'm not saying that we shouldn't do nothing. I'm only saying 
it doesn't really mean anything. It only means what anyone wants 
it to mean.”

“There's only as much value in the war as we want it to have?”

“Not just this one here. Every war.”

“What about the people who were driven out of their homes, those 
who were shot because they were thought to be sympathizers? What 
about the orphans and the starving children? What value do these 
people have?”

“To me?”

“Why does it have to be about you all the time?”

“Well, you're asking me.”

“I can't understand how a man like yourself is after Andy.”

“I can't understand how someone as daft as you works for the CIA.”

“So I'm a fool, just because I believe people have the right to 
live decent lives? The fishermen down the river are fools for 
trying as well? For not giving up?”

“No, they're fishermen. Smart trade; they cast a net and fill it 
with fish. No need to herd anything, and milk and sheer it. No 
need to sow, till and water. No, they just reap what the river 
has on offer. Smart folk, fishermen.”

“These are the last few people who are brave enough to keep 
living in a warzone.”

“And go where exactly? Wait for the Red Cross to feed them? The 
UN to free them? From who? You don't understand, I guess you 
yanks never did. The river is all that matters to these people. 
Without it, there's no life. Like they care who's running this 
charade. You should get out more, take a walk. Get down from that 
high horse of yours.”

“You're making things sound so fucking simple while in fact you 
don't have the slightest clue about what's at stake here. What's 
at stake in Vietnam, the six day war, Angola. It's fucking 
everywhere and you're acting like it's pointless.”

“It all depends on your point of view, that's all. To them, it 
is. To you, maybe it isn't.”

“And what about you? Do you care about all this, or do you just 
pull a trigger when you're told to?”

“Don't you?”

“When I have to. Not when I'm told to.”

“What if you're told you have to?”

“Faith. I trust in faith.”

“You know, I really can't tell when you're trying to bullshit me, 
or just yourself. You people have some real issues. At least I 
know what's wrong with me, you just live in a hazy world between 
reality and fantasy where everything's possible, including saving 
the world by bombing it to hell. I didn't think I'd be grateful 
for all the nightmares.”

“So you do have a conscience in the end?”

“Only I'm not proud about it. It doesn't really help, you know. I 
consider it a luxury.”

“You should. Because you're one cynical bastard if I ever saw 
one.”

“I can't wait to have this kind of conversation over Christmas 
dinner.”

“I bet you're adopted.”

“I'd wish.”

She braked abruptly and pulled over in front of a small 
three-storey building with faux gypsum columns outside, cast in 
some vaguely grecoroman rhythm. Bullets had found their way 
through the gypsum and into the concrete, while flecks of chipped 
paint riddled the wide doors.

“We're here,” said Nicole and stopped the engine.

Ethan replied with a yawn:

“I hope there's a real bed.”

“I hope they have two rooms.”

“I wouldn't worry about the vacancies.”

A man that appeared to be the hotel manager stepped through the 
doorway, dressed in a white linen shirt, smart black trousers and 
matching shoes, around his forties, tall, thin, almost gaunt. He 
smiled rather widely, a few nickel-cases showing. He bowed 
slightly before adding:

“Welcome to Olowo Hotel. Luggage?”

Ethan smiled and nodded towards Nicole, saying:

“Certainly, her.”

The hotel manager looked puzzled for a moment, then let out a 
polite little laugh, and ushered them inside.

“Coffee, or tea?” he said, and extended a hand to a couple of 
tables and a small bar.

“No, thank you,” said Nicole, and Ethan shook his head. He told 
him then:

“We need two rooms.”

The manager was already shuffling through the guestbook when he 
asked somewhat confused:

“You mean a double?”

Nicole sniggered behind Ethan, while he spoke slowly and surely, 
as if to a child, stressing each word:

“Two separate rooms with a single bed.”

The manager looked apprehensively at both of them for a moment, 
and then smiled assuredly.

“Certainly, sir, madam. Cash up front, please. Hotel policy. Five 
hundred,” he said, nodding to both of them. Ethan raised a brow 
but nevertheless pulled five hundred's bills and paid. “Thank 
you. We're happy to have you staying. Please, follow me,” the 
manager said and led them to the first floor, to their rooms. 
Each one a miniscule affair with a water basin and remarkably a 
proper bed. There was a common toilet at the end of the hallway. 
The manager then said with almost unbridled pride:

“There are separate facilities for the ladies!”

“Fantastic. I wouldn't want to bump into her,” Ethan said smiling 
ironically while Nicole seemed to ignore him.

The manager looked at them both once more fleetingly, opened his 
mouth to ask something but thought better of it and said nothing. 
He then straightened himself and said in business-like tones:

“Well, there is more press staying here. I hope you'll enjoy your 
stay, even under the circumstances.”

“You mean the war?”

“The war will end some day, sir. But the mosquitoes, they never 
go out of fashion! The river, you see.”

Ethan grinned and nodded, shook his head and looked at Nicole who 
simply shrugged.

“Thank you very much,” Ethan said, while Nicole stared outside 
the hallway window onto the street below. The manager bowed again 
before adding:

“Ring the bell if you need me. I'll be downstairs!”

Nicole asked Ethan without turning her gaze away from the street:

“You think everyone else down there thinks the same?”

“Does it matter?”

“I forgot, nothing really does.”

“I need to sleep.”

She nodded, and shut the door behind her. Soon, she could hear 
Ethan snoring from across the hallway.

* * *

He woke up with a mild headache. There was still light pouring in 
from the small window. He felt his body ache from all the 
exertion the night before. He checked his wristwatch; it was 
almost four in the afternoon.

He vaguely remembered seeing a strange dream. The one thing he 
was certain about was that the dream hadn't been a nightmare. 
Curiously enough he remembered it had something to do with James. 
He itched in various places; he scratched reflexively and noticed 
the bites: mosquitoes. He washed his face and scrubbed some of 
the muck and dirt away, feeling a bit freshened and somewhat 
cleaner. He put on his clothes and tied his shoes with the usual 
haste of a professional soldier.

He picked up his key and his camera along with the press card, 
and closed the door behind him. He went over to Nicole's room and 
knocked, but she didn't reply. He knocked again but didn't shout; 
she might be still sleeping he thought, and went down the stairs.

The hotel manager was serving coffee to some clients that looked 
quite foreign, blond-haired and red-faced. Evidently he was the 
sole proprietor, manager, and waiter. Probably noone else worked 
here anymore. He had simply, like others in the city, decided to 
stay, despite the war. Curiously enough, there was still money to 
be made even at a time and place such as this one. The manager 
took notice of him and waved from the table he was serving. He 
told him with a smile:

“Letter for you Mr. Owls, from Ms. Heurgot. A moment.”

Ethan nodded and smiled thinly, thinking it strange Nicole had 
already left without waking him up. He noticed the foreigners, a 
man and a woman, looked at him vaguely but quickly resumed 
sipping their coffee silently. The hotel manager went behind his 
flimsy-looking counter and unlocking a small cabinet, gave Ethan 
a small envelope. Ethan was about to ask for an opener, when the 
manager promptly offered a simple kitchen knife which did the job 
just as well.

There was a small note inside the envelope; Nicole had to get in 
touch with a certain valuable contact of hers. She had written 
down a list of people and places where he should start asking 
questions. He immediately felt shut out, as if running errands on 
her behalf. Maybe it was less time consuming that way, or maybe 
she had other, work-related priorities. The Agency. What kind of 
operation where the Yanks really running down here? He had little 
idea about how these things worked. He decided he'd ask her some 
real hard questions about all this business when they met later 
that night at a shady place called 'Queen Madimba'. Until then, 
he had to make a call.

“Is there some place I can make a call in private?”

The manager rolled his eyes for a moment, then said with slight 
apprehension:

“For you, it is probably possible. You'd need to get over to 
Victoria Square, talk to whoever's in charge there. All landlines 
go through the military, you see.”

Ethan nodded and smiled, before adding:

“I would know my way around. Is there a map I could use? I 
wouldn't want to end up in a minefield or something now, would I?”
 he said and smiled, while the manager found the joke lacking and 
simply gave Ethan a shoddy, trodden piece of paper that was a 
rough drawing of the relative locations of the hotel, the river, 
the city center and the harbor.

“Victoria Square is in the city center. Ask around if you need 
anything else. And I would like that back when you're done,” said 
the hotel manager before adding:

“I lost my wife to a mine, only last year. It is no laughing 
matter.”

“Certainly. I was just.. Right, thank you,” Ethan said and walked 
out onto the street, which was mostly empty. Apart from the heat 
and the nearly debilitating moisture in the air, there was little 
to do other than peddle foodstuffs and alcohol to passing troops 
and patrols, either on or off duty. Kids would invariably pop in 
and out of sight, some playing catch or football, others trying 
to sell something they'd fished in the river.

The town seemed subdued; poor, but still living. Hurt, but not 
destroyed. His walk took him through a few streets he could 
barely recognise. Some of those were in his list, others were in 
fact nothing more than alleys or dirt paths. He decided to grab a 
bite at a stall selling fried fish.

While he ate, he noticed the peculiar silence. This was a city at 
war, in the front lines, but nothing other than the presence of 
the military reminded him of that. There was no shelling, no 
gunfire, no sound of engines revving up and armor clamoring by. A 
city under siege, without walls or trenches, nothing but the 
river as a moat. It seemed like nothing would ever force the 
people to abandon it, except perhaps the river drying up.

He felt full after the first fish and drank a couple mouthfuls of 
beer. It felt like home for the barest moment: lukewarm and 
tasteless, just like the water in this town.

He then made his way straight to Victoria square where he could 
see a lot more soldiers, jeeps and trucks. It looked like every 
other building around the square had been taken over as barracks, 
storage or command center. The congregation of so many soldiers 
in one place looked like a staging area. Perhaps some kind of 
operation was about to begin.

As he approached a small tent near a guardpost, a soldier shouted 
at him something in Yoruba, without bothering to aim his rifle at 
him. Ethan held both hands high, one of them holding the press 
pass. The soldier squinted at it, and called one of his 
superiors, a sergeant by the looks of his stripes. The sergeant 
looked at Ethan with puzzled disbelief:

“Reporter man?”

Ethan nodded and said:

“Richard Owls, London Times. I could gladly use a phone.”

“A telephone?”

The sergeant said something to the soldier and they broke down in 
laughter. Despite the complete lack of courtesy, the sergeant 
pointed at the small tent and said:

“Try the Captain,” and resumed what must have been a keen joke 
between himself and the guard on duty.

Ethan approached the tent were a rather small man with the 
insignia of a Captain was studying maps and a few sheets of 
reports, sitting down in a fold-up garden chair. On the small 
table, his service revolver lay in pieces, ready to be cleaned. 
Ethan cleared his throat and announced himself:

“Captain? Richard Owls, London Times. I'm sorry to bother you, 
but I do need to phone my office.”

The Captain looked up from his work briefly and barely 
registering Richard he pointed to a hand-crank magnetic phone. He 
told him then:

“Ask for Operations. Tell them to connect you to an outside 
operator and give him the number.”

“Right, thank you. Terribly sorry, really. I hadn't expected this 
kind of lockdown.”

“Makes you wish you hadn't left the office, doesn't it?”

The captain smiled broadly, and Ethan replied with a nod. He 
asked for the operator and after giving the number, there was a 
small pause, and then some more silence before the silky voice of 
a woman came on the phone:

“Who would you like to speak to?”

Ethan hesitated for a moment before asking the captain:

“Captain, would you mind? It's a sensitive call.”

“It's my phone. I do mind. Get on with it or hang up, I don't 
care.”

Ethan nodded, and having no other option went ahead:

“Ian Ruthers, please. Tell him it's from the Nigerian desk.”

The voice on the other end sounded puzzled:

“Sir, do you know were it is you are calling?”

“I bloody know very well, get me Ruthers, just mention my name 
Richard Owls. And I'll hold.”

There were a few moments of silence and then some hiss and the 
sound of lines mingling and connecting. Finally, after almost 
half a minute Ian could be heard on the other side:

“Have you lost your mind? Calling from half-way around the world 
on an insecure line! What do you think this is, Whitehall?”

“I'm in a tent, borrowing a phone from a Nigerian captain. 
Listen, I need you to run a check. Nicole Heurgot, says she works 
for Virginia.”

“What the hell, Ethan? What's with her? You don't mean Langley, 
Virginia.”

“The one and the same. Listen, just let me know when you find 
out. A yes or no will do.”

“I guess I'll have something by tomorrow night. Listen on the 
BBC. Tomorrow at 10. God, the paperwork you're putting me through 
alone could kill me.

“Right.. How will I..?”

“Right, well. Off the top of my head, and I'm not saying we do 
this all the time, we'll use the `Top of the Pops' opening song. 
I know you hate the Beatles, so.. `Hey Jude' seems fitting. 
Remember, opening song. And Ethan, I don't know why exactly 
you're asking this but it doesn't sound good at all.”

“I know. I just hope I'm wrong.”

Dead men can't dance

The summer heat only became unbearable because of the moisture, 
an all-permeating, nearly absurd moisture that seemed to soak 
through everything, especially skin. The bloody river, thought 
Ethan to himself while he greedily drank off a bottle of 
homebrew, extravagantly priced beer. He was waiting for someone 
who supposedly could get him info through the brigade HQ. If the 
beer was any indicator, that would be a proper piss as well. As 
had been everyone else so far; a piss and a wank further away 
from anything useful.

The proprietor of the small tavern which also doubled as a drug 
store and coffee-shop was eyeing him warily. The natural distrust 
of anyone so obviously out of town was only heightened in these 
uncertain times. And it most certainly had nothing to do with 
race or color; things were much more complicated in 
distinguishing friend from foe, though from certain points of 
view, it was business as usual. In any case, Ethan's sour look on 
every gulp wouldn't put him on the grumpy old man's good books at 
any rate.

“Another one, please,” said Ethan while wiping the sweat off his 
neck in a vain attempt to dry himself. The tavern was mostly 
empty save for a few older men, idly drinking away their day in 
each other's company silently, as if nothing, ever, needed to be 
said. The owner was languid in his moves, as if reluctant to 
serve Ethan.

He filled another bottle of beer from a small barrel over his 
counter, using some sort of siphon and a keg. As he did so, 
carefully trying not to spill the beer, he said without taking 
his eyes off the bottle:

“He won't make it you know.”

Ethan raised an eyebrow and smiled almost involuntarily before 
replying with a question:

“How is that, really?”

The old man drained the last of the beer off the keg, and brought 
the bottle to Ethan's small table. There was some beer foam right 
at the mouth of the bottle, which the old man blew away with a 
whizzy puff, before settling it down on the table. He then looked 
at Ethan with wide, almost hazy, glassy eyes and said:

“He can smell you are trouble.”

Ethan shook his head and his stilted smile had the look of 
tasting salt about it. He drank another gulp of beer and asked 
the old man, “I didn't know trouble has a smell of its own,” 
trying to sound non-chalant, unconvincingly enough.

“It doesn't. It's the smell of shit!” blared the owner with an 
almost accusing stare and suddenly broke down in laughter. The 
other two men followed suit, showing off hollowed out mouths and 
wrinkled, leathery faces worn through a life-time of being used 
to hardships of all kinds.

“And you're full of it, Englishman. Who dem asking for trouble, 
days like these, but dem trouble, no?” said one of the two, while 
the owner chimed in himself again, “You can't hide a pile of shit 
if you paint it gold, mister. It still smells, so do you. Your 
man, whoever he is, won't be coming. Hope he didn't take your 
money first.”

Ethan couldn't manage a reply. Taken by surprise by their 
straightforward manner, he barely managed a grin while acceding 
to having being played like a fool:

“He did. I'm that transparent, am I?” he said, while all three 
men smiled and nodded. The one who hadn't even spoken a word said 
then, “You dem English” smiled, shrugged and sipped his beer. The 
owner was sitting behind his counter, and tapping his hand with 
each word he said to Ethan, “What's a white man doing in the 
middle of a war?” and added with a rather grim face, “It can't be 
fishing now.”

Ethan took the hint, nodded almost reverentially, drank another 
gulp of beer, left another five pounder on the table and got up. 
As he stepped outside the door, he began to realise there was a 
lot more to what the old man had just said.

* * *

The rest of the leads proved to be dead ends as well; they all 
talked about a red cross caravan, and they had all heard about 
the attack. But nothing solid, nothing first hand. Those few 
shady people that made a living trading all sorts of information 
had either been laying too low to be found or had simply refused 
to deal; one of them had just left saying the whole thing was too 
hot. In any case, all the useful info about Andy boiled down to 
that he was indeed missing.

Soldiers on jeeps and foot patrols made their presence felt 
around the town while Ethan moved about; they asked him for his 
papers on more than one occasion. They had lists with names and 
photos, actively looking for people that the Nigerian government 
had one way or the other decided had been acting against their 
best interest: Soldiers of fortune, spies, people who made it 
their business to know all kinds of dangerous, possibly 
profitable things.

An English journalist casually roaming about Onitsha and asking 
people questions then could be all three things if his name or 
photo was on that list. It was a crude thing to do, using 
soldiers for field intelligence work, but then again he himself 
was running on pure luck and whatever ropes James was pulling. 
His cover was extremely thin, but he had no other option; it was 
only a matter of time before someone would notice he was nowhere 
to be found, and still he had nothing solid on Andy. At least, he 
thought to himself, they hadn't found a body yet.

The evening breeze brought the smell of river life to Ethan as he 
walked past a checkpoint under an old, anglican church. He stood 
there for a moment or so with real, keen interest as its small 
congregation poured outside, shuffling their feet with purpose: 
it would be curfew time soon. True enough, the chruch bell 
started to ring, forcing Ethan to look at his watch: half past 
seven. He would run a bit late for his meeting with Nicole.

He nodded with an uncertain smile at the soldiers motioning him 
to get off the street and hastily took off towards the river 
bank, quickly disappearing in the flimsy shade of a small shop 
alley. He could hear movement and shouts behind him; the military 
police was hurrying people out of the streets and into their 
houses.

At the end of the alley he ventured a quick look behind him. 
Nothing. As he crossed an empty street, he noticed it was the 
same in every direction he gazed at: The natural denizens of city 
streets, dogs and cats alike, could barely be seen hiding away 
under alcoves, small balconies and porches. Pigeons and swallows 
were trudging along stained rooftops lazily, and even rats seemed 
attuned to the curfew, fleeing purposefully back into their 
shadowy nests wherever there were people left to harrow.

Then he noticed more movement near the river bank, jeeps and 
trucks moving along the length, while all the while tugboats 
putted away upstream. With a fleeting look he noticed a patrol 
coming his way. Across the street, he finally saw a sign that 
read “Madimba”. He crossed the empty road with a casual walking 
pace, and pushed the door open. A flight of steps lead downward 
into a dimly lit cellar, hushed conversations and the faint but 
unmistakable sound of brass; jazz.

He closed the door behind him and carefully tread down the narrow 
steps. He then looked around, taking in the whole setting of the 
underground bar. It was elegantly decorated but crudely 
furnished; crammed but somehow everyone seemed comfortably 
seated. The smell of sweat and smoke weighed heavy.

It was a small wonder that a place like that could be found 
hidden away amidst the forefront of a war, but there was an 
explanation for that as well; it was packed with foreigners. 
Europeans from the look and sound of them, almost down to the 
last one.

He then saw Nicole silently waving him over to a table near one 
corner of the establishment; a tall, lank black man was sitting 
beside her. After wading through tightly packed tables and 
customers, he pulled up the single empty chair and sat, 
addressing Nicole:

“Who is this?”

“This is Adu, Adu Nebdele. He's going to help us get to Owerri.”

“First of all, I don't like the fact we didn't talk this over 
first. Why Owerri?”

Adu then spoke out of turn, just when Nicole was about to talk 
and bluntly said with a cultivated accent:

“I think your brother's dead.”

“Who is this again?” said Ethan without even turning to 
acknowledge the man's existence. Nicole replied with a calming 
voice, “I've known this man far longer than you, Ethan. You can 
trust him, he's been more than useful in the past.”

Ethan shook his head and sagged back on his chair. He flicked his 
gaze between Nicole and Adu, and said with a sickly grin:

“Can I now? What makes him such an expert on dead people?”

Nicole's face flashed red with slow-boiled anger and her piercing 
eyes met Ethan's with a decisive clash. Neither of them seemed 
willing to look away. Adu then drew himself closer to Ethan and 
said in a low-keyed voice, trying to sound condescending:

“I have a brother-in-law, works in the morgue. There's been lot 
of work lately.”

Ethan spared a vehement look in Adu's direction that only seemed 
to stick for a moment or two. He then lowered his gaze and said 
after sighing:

“I need a drink.”

Adu nodded and asked him casually:

“Scotch?”

“I thought there was a war going on,” replied Ethan, a mocking 
expression on his face.

“Not if you're a white Englishman with pounds to spare. Anything 
particular?” asked Adu to which Ethan answered along with a wave 
of his hand, “I wouldn't go that far. Anything other than rye 
would be good.”

Adu smiled thinly, nodded and got up. As he slowly made his way 
through the crowded tables towards the bar at the other end, 
Ethan told Nicole with ire in his voice:

“I don't appreciate this. Who the hell is that?”

“He's an associate. A valuable associate. Has been for the past 
three years. If you can't trust him, you can't trust me, and that 
would be a damn shame because I want us to find Andy. Alive. 
Maybe you're having second thoughts about this,” said Nicole, 
nursing a barely touched glass of wine. Ethan almost erupted into 
a drowned out shout:

“Now hold on a minute! The last thing I need right now is some 
sort of lecture from the wife and all sorts of Agency bullshit!”

Nicole's face had a serious, business-like look when she said, “
Adu is a very well connected man. He keeps an uneasy balance 
between the two sides. I've been going in and out thanks to him 
ever since I've been operating here.”

“Which brings us to the question, what exactly are you working on 
here? And why did you drag Andy into this mess?”

“Listen, I really wish I hadn't but that was his choice. It 
really was. I thought it would be relatively safe. That was my 
mistake. Now, about the job..”

She let her voice trail off while the jazz filled the next few 
silent moments. Ethan shook his head and said through a tight, 
forced smile:

“Bloody right. A mistake. But not the last one.”

Their gazes remained locked like lovers in a quarrel; neither one 
seemed willing to let go, as if in a staring contest. Instead of 
passion though, there was breweing anger. When Adu returned with 
Ethan's drink though, they looked away as if somehow slightly 
embarassed.

“Thanks,” said Ethan with barely audible mutter, while Nicole 
silently sipped at her own glass of wine. Adu then told Ethan 
matter-of-factly:

“I can imagine you might be upset about this, but it's good, 
solid information. Caucasian, English passport.”

“I'll wait and see with my own two eyes,” Ethan replied and then 
said to Nicole accusingly, striking his finger at the table, “
I've been running in circles all day, and you simply ask your man 
and it's a done deal? Andy's dead?”

The jazz song playing in the background reached a crescento, sax 
and trumpets blaring with a virtuoso's tenacity, easily drowning 
out the mingled, hushed voices all around the 'Madimba'. Nicole 
looked at Ethan with watery eyes and said, “Andy's not dead. I 
believe he is not dead. But we have to know, don't we? To keep 
looking, we have to know.”

Ethan drank a mouthful of the scotch. It made him flinch, his 
face sour. He nodded and said flatly:

“True enough. Besides, Owerri was down the road anyway. When do 
we leave?”

Nicole shrugged and said, “We can't leave tonight, not with the 
curfew in place. Tomorrow at dawn, at the earliest.”

“So what does that mean, we're stuck here for the night as well?” 
said Ethan indignantly.

Adu's mouth widened into a knowing smile, showing an impressively 
bright set of teeth before he said:

“There's a small room with a cot on the top floor were you can 
spend the night. A guesthouse, if you like. Besides, the curfew 
isn't all that it's cracked up to be if you're white and willing 
to spend money.”

“We could just bribe the MPs then? That simple?”

“If you find anyone sober. Things have been quiet for too long 
around here. They feel settled, at ease. There's no fighting 
right now. Regrouping, they call it.”

“But still..”

“Everyone needs to unwind. War is a tiresome affair, no? I'd 
thought you would know.”

Ethan laughed despite himself and downed the rest of his scotch.

“Is this why this place is full of foreigners? Noone really 
bothers with the curfew? Because the scotch it serves is barely 
three years old. All it's good for is a pissing.”

Adu nodded with a thin smile on his lips, and added:

“That's about right. Only it really is rye.”

“Rye?”

“Old family recipe. There's a war going on, remember?”

Ethan didn't laugh at that last remark, despite Adu's brilliant 
smile. He looked at his emptied glass and asked Adu then with 
some puzzlement:

“Family recipe, you said? This place yours, then? This is what 
you do, sell drinks and work with the CIA?”

Adu knit his hands together and smiled, while Nicole sipped at 
her drink languidly, staring at Ethan. Adu answered with a 
careful, concise tone:

“Among other things. Whatever the reason, we're here, and there 
are opportunities all around. It's a terrible thing, to waste an 
opportunity.”

“I don't really like you. Or your kind.”

“You mean businessmen?”

“No. Warmongers.”

Nicole closed her eyes and said calmly:

“Ethan, please. No need for namecalling.”

Adu smiled thinly before calmly retorting:

“This isn't about money, or profit. This is about survival. I 
could just as well imply that the British government is doing the 
same, trying to hold on to the oil contracts.”

“We didn't start this war, you know.”

“But there's only one outcome that suits you.”

“That's politics.”

“So they are politicians, but I'm a warmonger? It doesn't seem 
fair.”

“I think as much, only from a different point of view.”

“But do you really understand why I have to do all this? Stand in 
the middle, play all sides, balance things?”

“You're trying to tell me, you have no other option?”

“Precisely. Someone has to be the voice of reason in a very 
unreasonable affair,” he said and grinned before adding with a 
shrug, “..war.”

“I thought you were just selling info this way and that according 
to what suits the CIA.”

“Or maybe what suits me. Even I can't tell sometimes,” Adu said 
with a grin and looked at Nicole sideways for a moment. When she 
stared back he went on and added:

“You know where to look. My job is done.”

Nicole shot him a fiery look and told him with icy deliberation:

“That's not what we agreed upon.”

“It's not too late to reach another agreement. Perhaps it would 
be much more fair if Mr. Whittmore had a say in this.”

“How much?” blurted Nicole with a flustered face, while Ethan 
frowned and asked rather dully:

“How much about what, exactly?”

“Triple the usual,” said Adu casually, casting a fleeting gaze at 
Ethan who repeated his question, this time a lot more 
convincingly:

“The fuck what for?”

“Keeping his mouth shut,” Nicole said briskly. Adu replied with a 
annoying grin on his mouth:

“Indeed. That would be very bad for both of you, wouldn't it? In 
more than one way. Isn't that right, Ms. Heurgot?”

“I thought you said you could trust this man.”

“Trust is a rare commodity these days. The price, and the client, 
are.. Flexible,” said Adu with a sharp, shiny grin.

Ethan locked eyes with Adu. He had a look of calm determination 
about him, eyes glinting in the dim light of the oil lamp. The 
black man's grin turned into a thin line and a deep frown 
appeared on his face when without warning Ethan reached for his 
ankle and pulled his combat knife with one superbly fluid motion.

Nicole's eyes widened with shock while Adu's hands were already 
upending the table. She only had time enough to cry “Wait!” but 
Ethan was already off his chair, trying to sidestep the table. He 
went for Adu's arm with a quick jab with the knife, but he missed 
for an inch or so. The upturned table hadn't slowed him down, and 
he was right behind Adu who was already thrusting people aside, 
edging his way towards the bar.

The sudden commotion made people turn their heads in a snap. 
Nicole jumped off her chair and tried to grab Ethan by the waist. 
Her initial surprise had made her slow to act and she missed him 
by a few inches, grasping nothing but air.

Within moments, Adu had cleared his way through the tables, 
smashing glasses and brushing aside stunned customers. Ethan was 
only a few steps behind, his knife in hand. A quick nod and a 
moment later, the bartender was leaning behind the counter. When 
saw the movement he instinctively rushed towards the ground in an 
audacious tackle. Their feet connected; Adu tripped and suddenly 
fell sideways at the exact moment when a small cloud of wooden 
splinters, smashed tiles and pieces of cloth flew right above 
Ethan's head. The booming sound of a shotgun echoed like 
thunderclap around the small bar; mayhem ensued.

Shouts and cries mingled with the sudden rush of screeching 
tables and chairs as the panicked customers fled the 'Madimba'. 
Clicking metallic sounds alerted Ethan that the shotgun was being 
reloaded, even as Adu had rolled on his back and turned around to 
jump on Ethan.

With his sudden rush he had managed to pin Ethan's knife hand, 
but his grip was lax, his body badly placed, vulnerable. Ethan 
managed to swing a punch right in Adu's face with his free hand; 
it barely shook him. A couple more quick jabs had little effect 
other than Adu replying with a fist right in Ethan's stomach, 
grunting instinctively as he flexed his muscles.

Ethan tried to get a hold on Adu with his legs, catch him in a 
vice. He couldn't get a good grip, as Adu was piled up more 
pressure on his knife hand, trying to wrestle the knife away. His 
other hand went for Ethan's neck and met with opposition. While 
they grappled on the floor, Ethan heard a loud shot without 
warning, then another and one more, all in quick succession.

The crowd rushing outside reacted to the shots with a louder 
burst of bewildered, panicked shouts. They were still shouting 
when he heard the thud of a body falling limp against the floor, 
the sound of smashed glass following its way down.

They were both surprised and for an instant Adu's attention waned 
as he shot a reflexive look behind him, where the bartender 
should have been holding the shotgun. In that single moment his 
grip became just a tad more lax and allowed Ethan to slip his 
knife hand away with a sudden, violent shove.

Losing the grip on the knife hand, Adu tried to roll over on the 
floor, put some space between them. He tried to put his back 
against the bar, while he reached for someplace out of Ethan's 
sight. While he swung his body around, trying to catch Adu from 
an ankle or a leg, he saw Adu's face suddenly go slack, all the 
tension vanishing in an instant. His hand stayed for the merest 
moment still in the air, and then another shot was heard.

This time he saw Adu's whole body flex, quiver and shudder all in 
the blink of an eye before it fell limp against the bottom of the 
bar. Blood trailed down from the hole in his shaven head, now 
grossly disfigured, the cracked skull penetrating the skin. 
Nicole's shouts reawakened Ethan who stood there transfixed for 
the merest second, mesmerized from the puzzled look in Adu's 
eyes:

“Go! We have to run, now!”

Ethan stood up, sheathed his knife and ran towards the stairs 
right behind Nicole. He told her then, out of breath:

“Why, did you shoot him dead? I had him.”

“What an idiot! He was reaching for a gun.”

“I didn't see any gun,” Ethan said when he stepped outside. He 
could see a few of the customers shouting for any patrol to come 
to their help. From the corner of his eye he could see some 
pointing at him. Nicole dragged him along behind one of the walls 
of 'Madimba' and told him in a very strong manner, evidently 
quite upset:

“You can thank me later, you dolt! What kind of an asshole jumps 
on an informant like that? Without provocation as well!”

“Without.. He was bloody going to tell on us! Who knows whom to! 
I was protecting us! You!”

“Jesus! Just.. Fuck!”

“Listen, I think we need to make ourselves scarce. We've got to 
leave now, tonight.”

“Oh, you think?”

Shouts and the sound of boots and clattering helmets came from 
the street behind them. Some of the customers were talking wildly 
in accented English and French, while an authoritative voice 
wanted them to shut up.

“They're trying to explain the shots and all. We can't go back to 
the hotel right now,” said Ethan, licking his lips from his 
sweat.

“Any brighter ideas, then?”

“The river. Let's try the river.”

“The river's crawling with soldiers!”

“It's full of water as well! We'll get on a boat, or lay low 
someplace until things die down.”

“Die down? Are you- never mind, no time to argue. Go!” she said 
as the patrol leader shouted orders to his men, still trying to 
gleam an understanding from the terrified white folk.

They both ran towards the river bank, trying to use alleys and 
shadowy paths through the irregular maze of Onitsha's 
neighborhoods. Behind them, they could hear echoes of bellowing 
officers and the muffled sound of boots running. At each corner 
they would stop for a breath, then silently nod and keep going 
with the same pace. Anxious glances revealed wary eyes from the 
city folk peeking behind smudged windows and decrepit walls. They 
kept running and before long the empty streets gave way to a 
wild, lush vegetation.

Dusk had already fallen, and with the riverside in plain view, 
they laid low near a thick bush. Nicole was out of breath, her 
muscles burning from the effort. She bent over and weighed 
herself on her knees with sagged shoulders. Ethan knelt beside 
her and surveyed the river bank for a moment. She said then with 
pain written on her face:

“That's it. I'm beat,” and a short breath later added, “Can't go 
on like this.”

Ethan replied with a nod, quite unaffected by the physical 
strain:

“Right. I wasn't thinking about running all the way to Owerri 
anyway.”

Nicole laid down on her back and found in her just a breath of 
laughter before she replied, still grimacing from the exhaustion:

“Should've thought about that before.”

“Your valuable associate,” Ethan said icily, “was going to sell 
us out.”

“What the fuck do you know, anyway?” came Nicole's sharp, almost 
vicious answer, before she added with a sigh, “Real smart. 
Brilliant.”

“I know we need transportation,” said Ethan dryly, staring at the 
Niger's steady, gentle flow. A moment later he added with a 
vehement grin, “Do you have any brilliant ideas you'd like to 
share?”

Nicole shot him a weird look, her eyes all lit up. She suddenly 
sprung back on her feet, and said “Actually,” and then added as 
if it was her God-given right to do so, “I really do.”

* * *

The small river barge was dominated by a rather large stack of 
barrels and crates. Some had been spray painted with numbers and 
letters in the same pattern, while others were completely devoid 
of any markings. Most seemed battered and frayed, while few 
seemed brand new. As the last light of the day fell around them, 
it cast a blurred, murky reflection of the uneven heap on the 
water rolling lazily past the flimsy, almost flat hull. 

“You see,” said the Swede scratching his reddened beard as if 
deeply ponderous, “you have to have a.. How do you say that?”

“Perspective?”, asked Ethan and drew on his cigarette. The sound 
of crickets and buzzing mosquitos were drowned by the monotonous 
`put-put' of the two-stroke motor that somehow managed to barely 
propel the barge.

The Swede replied with a smile that took a moment or two to form 
on his sunburnt face. He then added as he peeked behind Ethan at 
the helmsman, a boy in his teens:

“Perspective. See, Muembe there lacks perspective. He just wants 
to feed his family. Never asks a thing.”

“I don't think he'd been working for you if he did.”

“Well, of course not. If anyone did, I'd be out of business,” he 
said turning back to face Ethan with a thin, gentle smile on his 
face. Ethan nodded and said nothing. His gaze wondered for a 
moment before it fell on the cargo. He asked then the Swede:

“And you just run up and down the river like that? No questions 
asked by anyone?”

“Sometimes, some do. But I can be very persuasive. Plus, the 
Nigerian Navy is more or less, a common joke around these parts,” 
he said and shook his head wildly.

Ethan drew on his cigarette slowly and said, “You're saying this 
is easy? Is that why you don't even bother with a canvas or some 
camouflage?”

“A canvas would draw even more attention. If I do meet a boat on 
the river, then they'll probably think I'm just running a 
shipment for the Army. The river is so plentiful, see? Fishermen 
fish, and I haul,” the Swede replied, waving his arms about.

“How much does this pay then?” asked Ethan with a frown on his 
brow.

“Are you looking to get into the business? Because I'd hate the 
competition,” replied the burly man, laughing heartily to 
himself.

“Not really, no. I'm kind of into the business myself, but I'm 
not a middleman.”

“Ah. Mercenary then?” he asked with a smile.

“Slightly different. Though I can't be sure there's a real 
difference,” replied Ethan with a somewhat weary look.

“Royal Marine!” the Swede exclaimed, pointing wildly with a 
finger.

“For God's sake, is it that bloody obvious?” asked Ethan slightly 
irritated. The swede leaned toward him and said, nodding with his 
head once so often:

“The knife. You seem calm but your body is tense. You keep an eye 
all the time. One hand on the cigarette, one near the knife. Edgy 
but cool. Not regular british army. I can tell. They are-”

Nicole then appeared from the small galley below and said in a 
flat, tired voice, “He's full of shit. I told him who you are,” 
and then she sat down on the deck, crossing her legs before 
adding “Must be going bored out of his mind.”

“I'm just trying to make your friend here feel at ease,” the 
Swede said throwing his hands in the air, acting the insulted 
part. Ethan drew a last whiff and threw his cigarette in the 
water before asking with smoke coming out of his mouth and nose:

“We could have come straight to this guy, why did we-”

Nicole interjected with a suddenly conversational tone:

“We needed to check with Adu first. We didn't know whether the 
Swede would even have a delivery today. See, Adu and the Swede 
are partners, so to speak,” she said with a gleeing smile and 
fluttered her eyes only for Ethan to see, before she threw her 
head backwards to gaze at the still faint stars in the sky.

His face sat in a frown for a moment or so, before looking 
sideways at Nicole and then back again at the Swede who was 
looking upwards and bobbing his head slightly as if counting in 
his head. He checked his wristwatch; it was almost ten o'clock. 

“Twenty, twenty-five thousand pounds. Give or take,” said the 
Swede suddenly. Ethan did not have to act surprised or impressed 
when he said:

“Bloody hell. Where do they get that kind of money?”

“That,” the Swede said waving a hand dismissively, “is not my 
concern.”

“I mean, how do they get hold of that kind of exchange. The 
exchange rate is ridiculous, not to mention the exorbitant 
inflation.”

“Well, I'm not an expert, but the French economy isn't that bad.”

“The who?” said Ethan with genuine puzzlement even though there 
was nothing wrong with his hearing.

“Your friend isn't exactly up to date on this war, is he?” said 
the Swede to Nicole who simply shrugged.

“I thought that.. Never mind. I'm tired. I really I am. Let's not 
have this kind of discussion right now. I'd rather listen to the 
radio,” said Ethan in a very natural way.

“There's one down below. I am the host, I'll go get it.”

Not a moment after the Swede went below, Nicole quickly turned 
her head and shot Ethan a look that overflowed with a raging 
intention for murder. She hissed, rather than said:

“Moron.”

Ethan replied calmly, almost non-chalantly:

“I won't stab this one, don't worry.”

Her nostrils flared with anger instinctively and right before she 
could retort, the Swede came back up, with the radio in hand. He 
tuned the dial first and then turned it on. Intense brass sounds 
and pompous drums came from the small speaker, while the Swede 
seemed instantly gratified judging from the grin on his face. 
Ethan asked him then:

“Could you tune that to the BBC?”

“You don't like Wagner?”

“I thought the Germans had this craze about Wagner.”

“I thought he was Austrian.”

“Never mind that. `Top of the Pops' is on now.”

“`Top of the Pops'? Seriously? You want to listen to that, now? 
Here?” said Nicole.

“It won't hurt or anything, will it? I'm a big fan of the Stones.”

The Swede shrugged and turned the dial, while the selector 
remained on the AM setting. Through a flurry of white noise and 
incoherent sounds, a clear voice could be heard from the speaker 
albeit with some static but nevertheless with surprisingly good 
reception:

“..so until they're ready, let's listen to their latest single to 
hit the record stores, `Hey Jude'!”

A loud applause was heard and the announcer's voice was cut 
crisply, while the clapping faded away and soon the voice of Paul 
McCartney came softly through.

Ethan's brow became a deep furrow. He flexed his hands and looked 
at Nicole with a calm, steady gaze. She felt his stare upon her 
after a moment and looked at him with a quizzical expression. He 
shook his head slightly and simply said:

“I just hate the Beatles,” after which suddenly and least 
expectedly, the young boy at the helm smiled brightly and sang 
along, “..naa, na na na naaa, hey Jude...”

* * *

Sometime into the night, they had travelled further down the 
river, mostly thanks to the stream rather than tiny motor. Nicole 
had been sleeping soundly for a few hours. But Ethan could not, 
now that he knew Nicole had been lying to him. What was worse, he 
couldn't read what was the truth between her lies. She was an 
excellent shot, and she was well connected. Her agenda though 
still remained conspicuously well-hidden. Was she simply working 
for herself, like the Swede? But to what end? Did she really want 
to find Andy as much as he did? Thoughts like these - and some 
even worse - tugged at his mind like ropes, bogging him down in a 
spiral with no real answers, no clear exit. 

He felt it was dangerous to stick close to Nicole. But she had 
saved him more than once so far. Whatever her methods and her 
real purpose, maybe she had put all that aside for Andy's sake. 
Maybe she'd explain later, maybe she had as much trouble trusting 
him as he did her. Andy was all that mattered, and soon - he 
hoped - he'd meet the corpse of some other unlucky bastard, not 
Andy's. Nicole couldn't really be trusted, but he had to admit to 
himself that she had gotten them this far. Andy was all that 
mattered, and that was what would keep him focused. That, and 
keeping a wary eye on her.

The warmth of the night earlier had given its place to a fresh, 
wet breeze that helped him stay awake despite the small hours. 
The Swede had helped with some sort of home-made vodka and 
stories about making even more money when the war would finally 
end: in the poor light the single lamp offered them, he'd shown 
him sketches and graphs about cables and telecommunications, 
satellites and whatnot, stuff that Ethan barely acknowledged they 
existed. Their little discussion was interrupted by the boy who 
spat out a glob of some sort of local chewing tobacco variety and 
said something in what must have been a local Igbo dialect.

He caught their attention and turning to look, they saw a flare 
lazily falling down, fading away with a trail of smoke behind it. 
Then another one shot up in the opposite direction further down 
from the east bank and they could almost see a small band of 
armed men waiting on a sandy patch of dirt.

“That's them, two flares, first over the river, the second over 
land,” said the Swede, eagerly telling the boy in what sounded 
like very bad Igbo to cut the engine. As the boy complied, he 
went to the helm and let the stream carry them slowly towards the 
lowered east bank.

“And the best part is, I don't have to off-load anything. They do 
all the work,” he said and pointed at the small group of men who 
were now holding a few lit lanterns and waving a torchlight to 
pin-point their location. The more they approached, the clearer 
it became not all of them were really men. Most were actually the 
same age the Swede's helmsman was, and some looked shorter, 
skinnier, every bit younger than the boy.

“They sent the boys to do a boy's work, no?” said the Swede 
smiling thinly before shaking Nicole gently on the shoulder and 
waking her up. In a heartbeat or two she was up, and after a 
couple of deep breaths and a stretch could have fooled anyone 
that she had slept for almost half a day. Ethan then asked the 
Swede, while Nicole bent slightly over the rim of the boat and 
splashed some water on her face:

“And they'll take us to Owerri?”

“I wouldn't know about that, but there's a good chance. I can't 
think of a reason they won't. For a price, of course.”

“I kind of left almost everything back at the hotel in Onitsha. 
We are sort of short of cash.”

“Even a fiver is worth a month's food down here. You'll pass off 
as a rich man in Biafra,” the Swede replied, and Nicole added 
after a cough:

“There's always other ways to pay, food and drugs being the 
highest in demand. And then there are the services.”

“Services? Can't think there's much office space in demand right 
now.”

“Are you really that thick, or is this your first war behind the 
trenches? Prostitution. Very commonplace.”

“I thought the Biafrans are hitting that pretty hard.”

“If you mean hard-ons, that's true,” the Swede said with a sly 
grin that almost made him look rather slimy all of the sudden.

They felt the boat settle on the wet sand with ease, and the boy 
jumped outside holding a flimsy, worn rope that filled the role 
of a mooring line of sorts. One of the boys wearing fatigues from 
the waist down, seemingly accustomed to the process, found a 
nearby mangrove and tied the rope around it. Then a man barked a 
couple of orders and the boys laid down their weapons and formed 
a sort of antline, carefully treading up to the boat where two of 
them had already began unloading the cargo.

The man in charge wore a full set of fatigues and even sported a 
red beret. When Ethan and Nicole jumped off the boat, he 
immediately asked them, making sure with a wave of his hand that 
a couple of rifles were already aiming at them:

“Who dem they now?” to which the Swede replied casually:

“Looking to get into Owerri. Looking for a Red Cross man. I've 
done business with her. Him, I've just met.”

“Ask the Red Cross, then,” the man said with a face that 
signified hostility.

“The Red Cross lost a caravan. Would you know anything about 
that?”

“Do I look like the Red Cross, englishman?” said the man with a 
sudden, wide grin, barely able to hold a laugh.

“Alright, we just want you to get us to Owerri.”

“What dem for?” asked the man, crossing his arms.

“We need to take a look at a corpse,” said Nicole rather bluntly, 
almost angrily.

The man shrugged and nodded, before adding in a quite plain 
fashion:

“Heard stranger things.”

He then shouted a few words that must have been names, because 
two boys settled down a crate they were carrying and came over to 
him. A short deliberation later, and after he had pointed at 
Ethan and Nicole quite fervently, they picked up their weapons 
and motioned with an awkward, mixed expression of confusion, fear 
and faked bravado to follow them. The man asked Ethan then:

“Rolex? Tag?”

“No, but it's eighteen karat gold anyway,” Ethan replied and 
unfastened it from his wrist, passing it over to the man and 
giving him an unpleasant look that seemed to go completely 
unnoticed. The man weighed the clock in his hand first and then 
asked Ethan with a rather serious tone:

“And her?”

“What do you mean? If this doesn't seem enough, then-”

“I don't want her money,” he said and licked his lips 
provocatively. Nicole shook her head, while the Swede gave his 
flask of vodka a swig, giggled and snorted.

“Now, wait a minute!” said Ethan in what sounded like a poor 
attempt at passing for the guy with all the men and the guns. He 
was about to reach for his ankle knife when Nicole burst into 
laughter, and said in-between:

“I mean, where's that vaunted, sense of humor, huh? Jesus, Ethan, 
you take everything too seriously.”

The man nodded and extended his hand in what seemed a genuine 
gesture, motioning the boys to lower their guns as well.

“Ms. Heurgot and I have met in the past. I thought it was strange 
to meet again under so similar circumstances?”

“I wasn't searching for a corpse back then, Yenkele,” said 
Nicole, shaking her head.

“No, but you looked just as wonderful and sleepless,” Yenkele 
replied with the tiniest hint of a bow.

“You can tell?” said Nicole, with a smile and a nod. Ethan asked 
Yenkele in all seriousness, “Can I at least have my watch back 
then, if your friend would be so kind?” to which he received the 
frank answer, “Oh, I'm keeping the watch. War contribution.”

“Ah, I see. Any more surprises?” Ethan said with an almost 
shrill, irate voice.

“I'm all out of vodka,” said the Swede and everyone let out a 
small laugh, except for Ethan, who couldn't help looking at 
Nicole like she had stabbed him in the eye.

“Come, let's walk over to the truck.”

“Opel?” asked Nicole with hands in her pockets, Ethan walking a 
few steps behind her.

“Unimog from Angola,” replied Yenkele and nodded 
enthusiastically. Nicole then said, “Going up in the world, I 
see.”

Soon they were sitting inside the cabin of the truck and the last 
of the cargo had been loaded. The Swede was waving goodbye as he 
and the boy turned the boat around and headed upstream, when 
Yenkele started the engine with a powerful rev that blanked out 
everything for a few seconds. When the noise died down, he asked 
Nicole:

“Where do I drop you off?”

“The morgue,” said Ethan uninvited, and Nicole nodded. There was 
a strange look of bewilderment on Yenkele's eyes that quickly 
gave its place to a mild indifference, when he said:

“I thought you were joking about the corpse.”

* * *

The morgue's pale blue-white neon lights made even the living 
stand out as if they had been just as cold dead as the corpses 
filling it. The whole cooling chamber was actually reserved for 
important people, like officials, dignitaries, and mostly 
foreigners. Somehow to the Biafrans it was really important that 
a dead foreigner - perhaps a journalist or a UN official or a 
priest with inordinate amounts of belief in mankind - received 
all due care when the time came: a morgue, a funeral, a 
tombstone. The rest of the normal people could just die wherever 
they liked, but not the foreigners. 

“We keep them here, until their relatives and governments are 
notified. Most are claimed, and we arrange the transportation of 
the body through the Red Cross, sometimes the UN. Some though, 
stay here forever,” said the doctor in charge. Nicole asked then, 
“You can keep a corpse indefinitely?”

“No, I mean they get buried here, in Biafra. We can't keep anyone 
more than two weeks. Not a lot of room, anyway. But this is a 
remarkably equipped facility. The bodies are kept in cold 
storage,” he said with a slightly awkward smile. Ethan said 
bluntly, impatiently:

“Will you just, show us the corpse?”, to which the doctor nodded 
and led the way towards a specific slot, while Ethan added “
Un-fucking-believable. It's like a bloody farmer's market, isn't 
it?”. He wiped his mouth without a need, suddenly feeling nervous 
despite the fact that he really believed this corpse was simply a 
useful mistake from which they could move on. Still, something 
inside ate at him. A quick gaze at Nicole told him that odd 
feeling came from her. The question of why she had lied to him 
gnawed his mind.

“Ready?” asked the doctor, to which Ethan retorted:

“You're not very good at this, you know that, don't you?”

“A doctor is supposed to tend to the living, sir,” the doctor 
said apologetically, and continued, “I'm only saying that because 
the sight is particularly..”

“Just get on with it, yes, please,” said Ethan and the pulled the 
handle on the small door, opening it carefully, almost 
reverently. He slid out the stainless bed with care, revealing 
the badly charred body of a man laying almost comfortably on his 
back, with a bullet-ridden chest almost torn to pieces. Nicole 
gasped at the sight instantly and her face furrowed, while Ethan 
couldn't help wondering at how anyone could identify this man 
with any amount of certainty. The doctor spoke then in a 
professional, easy voice:

“White caucasian male, judging from the shape of the hips and the 
cranium. Large entry and exit wounds on the chest probably from a 
high-powered rifle. Body stance indicates the fire was irrelevant 
to the man's death. Two gold fillings melted away, both on the 
right frontal wisdom teeth. A broken clavicula, an older wound, 
possibly as a child.”

The doctor paused, as if waiting for something from either Ethan 
or Nicole, but they both remained silent for more than just a 
moment. The doctor felt compelled to ask:

“Does this man seem to be the one you're looking for?”

Nicole broke down in sudden tears, sobbing like a little girl 
then and nodded furiously even as the doctor tried to show her 
the burnt off personal effects that were found on the body: 
Andy's switchblade, his steel-cased watch with their father's 
signature on them, and a badly burnt but still somewhat readable 
passport. It was all there, this looked exactly like it should 
have been Andy's body.

Except Ethan wasn't buying it because while the doctor was 
talking, he had been taking a good hard look at the body. Because 
real doctors don't call molars wisdom teeth. Because he hadn't 
seen an X-ray machine, and there was no other way to see whether 
or not a burnt corpse had a specific bone broken, which in itself 
was suspect. And not just any bone, but the same bone he himself 
could remember Andy had broken back when they were still thirteen 
years old. His mind went blank for a moment before it started to 
race once more, his senses cut off from his surroundings.

His thoughts became dominated by the fact that someone was 
staging Andy's death. Not only that, but whoever was behind all 
this, they had gone to some length to make him feel quite 
adamantly that his brother was dead and gone. His eyes 
reflexively fell on Nicole who was wiping her tears off with the 
back of her hand, whispering Andy's name.

And even though a part of him wanted to simply scream on the top 
off his lungs for both of them to cut the bullshit and tell him 
why they were so eager to wank him into believing his brother 
dead, another part of him knew that he had to play the same way, 
and act the role of the grief-stricken brother. Fool them for a 
while longer, just as they had him fooled all the time before.

He cleared his throat and closed his eyes for a moment. He drew a 
deep breath and said, even as Nicole had thrown herself on his 
arms, weeping:

“Who do we talk to about the funeral?”
