\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a radical departure from the first book, for which writing a sequel seems
 untimely or perhaps even unwanted, I'm writing Blood Bonds (working title).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The story is set during the Biafran-Nigerian civil war, or Biafran war of
 independence (depending on whose side you're on or on your POV), and especially
 in 1968.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main protagonist, and what is later revealed to be a tragic figure is
 Ethan Whittmore, a captain of the Royal Marines and a British military
 advisor in Lagos, Nigeria.
 Ethan Whittmore has served in Kenya doing commando and paramilitary work
 of a dubious nature, having done things he is loathe to talk about and
 not especially proud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Lagos he has befriended his Nigerian Liaison, James Dwele, a Major (?)
 in the Nigerian Army.
 Dwele's brother had fought in the Kenyan liberation struggle only a few
 years earlier, and had died at the very hands of Ethan.
 It was not until after they had become friends that James learned of Ethan's
 involvement, background and history.
 After an internal struggle he decided to wait in order to exact his revenge
 and did so in a methodical, cold and calculating manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Ethan's brother, Doctor Andy (Stanley?) Whittmore goes into Biafra
 with a Red Cross relief mission, Ethan tries to warn his brother and discourage
 him because of the dangers involved with going into a civil war.
 Andy is adamant and waves away his brother's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a couple of months though, all contact between Ethan and Andy is lost.
 James runs some checks with Intelligence and informs Ethan that the red
 cross camp had been raided, most possibly by a local warlord, but there
 was not a single body of a caucasian to be found, suggesting that they
 either fleed deep into the jungle, unable to get to a town for help, or
 had been kept as prisoners to be ransomed at some point in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The essence of it was that Andy was somewhere in the Biafran jungle, most
 probably alive, but certainly in danger, if not already dead and buried
 somewhere in the jungle with no hope of ever finding a body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan is torn between duty and love for his younger brother, and after being
 urged by James, he decides to abandon his posting, go AWOL and search for
 his brother.
 In that undertaking, he counts on the help of James who will provide him
 with an extraction helicopter when and if Ethan locates Andy, as well as
 updates via radio of the movement and disposition of Nigerian and Biafran
 forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan contacts an acquaintance in MI6, Ian Ruthers, a war buddy from Kenya
 who owes him a favor or two, and arranges an identity as a journalist attached
 to a red cross caravan going into Biafra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once he sets out (not from Lagos but from a large red cross camp near the
 borders) and goes through the jungle, on the second day of their trek they
 stop for supplies and rest at a French Catholic monastery, run by a few
 nuns, some French, some local converts.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole Heurgot, a nurse who claims was part of a red
 cross caravan that was attacked, and her fleet brought her to the relative
 sanctuary and safety of the monastery.
 When Ethan introduces himself as who he really is tells her he is looking
 for his brother, she says to him that not only she knew Andy and they where
 on the same caravan, but that they were also lovers and she fears he might
 be dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In truth, Nicole is a french agent, working in league with Andy.
 After she happens upon Ethan, she notifies Andy via radio (the monastery
 also doubles as a cache and forward post for french intelligence operations
 in the area which involve providing equipment to the biafrans) about Ethan's
 search.
 Andy tells Nicole to wrangle his brother around, buy some time until he
 sends some personal effects from their jungle hideout to a nearby town,
 so that they can cook up a badly charred white caucasian body that could
 be Andy, and convince Ethan that Andy is dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the meantime, Ethan contacts James and finds out that he could not cover
 for him effectively, and trying to fake his leave of absence did not work
 out.
 He has been marked as AWOL and a court-martial and certain stripping of
 rank awaits him when he returns.
 As far as the Nigerians are concerned, they fear he has turned over to
 the Biafrans, and is considered an enemy of the state to be shot on sight.
 With his own government washing its hands off him and the Nigerians who
 he had been training considering him a traitor, Ethan has nowhere to go
 back to.
 His only purpose and reason now is to find his brother, dead or alive,
 and then try to vanish somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At that point the monastery is attacked by a local warlord, and Ethan single
 handedly kills a couple of them as well as the warlord, but even though
 the rest of the bandits flee, many of the red cross men and women have
 been killed, and the rest refuse to go on and simply try to make it back
 to Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Without a valid cover Ethan then asks for Nicole's help, which she seems
 to give willingly, out of concern for Andy.
 When Ethan explains that there's nothing left for him behind, and while
 already on their way to the closest town past the borders, she reveals
 to Ethan that she is actually a British agent working under cover in Biafra,
 and she is confident that her network of agents will be able to at least
 find out if Andy is alive, and even perhaps his whereabouts.
 Not only that, but she is confident she can smuggle Ethan out of the country
 and perhaps clear his name, so that Ethan has one more reason to stick
 with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they arrive at the bordertown, they settle for the night in a shanty
 hotel.
 When Ethan wakes up, he finds out that Nicole has gone and has left him
 a note with some contacts whom he must talk with, and arranges a meeting
 in a safehouse, because of pressing business.
 In truth, Nicole left to arrange the duping of the body and the various
 contacts that are supposed to feed Ethan with false information, have him
 go around in circles only to have him find out his brother is dead in the
 morgue (a fake body).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While Nicole is away, Ethan in the back of his head is always alert and
 distrustful especially now that he believes the only man he can trust is
 James, and the only man who might actually have an escape route available.
 He contacts his MI6 man in dire need, asking to know whether or not there
 is a woman like Nicole working for the british in biafra.
 Though reluctantly, his buddy Ian tells him he'll have to do a search.
 He arranges it so that he passes a 'yes' or 'no' message via the BBC, the
 next night (perhaps a specific song, or a glitch in the clock beeps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The contact spot is a bar, where Ethan receives the message from BBC radio
 that Nicole is not who she claims she is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole, gives him the bad news that Andy is dead, his body in the morgue,
 charred and almost unrecognizable but for his dental fillings, harmonica
 and switchblade with his initials and Eton insignia (or whatnot).
 Ethan is convinced he is being lied to because his brother had a slightly
 smaller hip (or whatnot) that seemed okay in this body.
 Ethan does not openly express himself, but seems withdrawn and in mourning,
 while heavily contemplating his next move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole weeps convincingly enough, and says to Ethan that tomorrow morning
 she'll arrange passage for Ethan first to (african state bordering south
 nigeria) and then on to South Africa where he might have a better luck
 clearing his name with the army.
 For that night, they'll sleep together in the safehouse with the local
 biafran man that acts as her bodyguard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan times his attack well and catches the man off-guard.
 In the fight that ensues, the man is killed and Nicole gets away.
 Rummaging through the man's belongings he finds a few clues (key, receipts
 etc.) that lead him to expose Nicole's network as what it really is, a french
 network of agents.
 ONe of them also coughs up the location of the jungle HQ/hideout, where
 Ethan decides to go next, believing that he had been sidetracked on purpose,
 and a fake body of Andy was indeed proof that he was alive and certainly
 their prisoner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When he arrives at the site he finds out a red cross deserted camp, similar
 to what his brother's camp should have been.
 Trying to search for more clues, he is attacked suddenly and rendered unconscio
us, by his own brother Andy.
 When he wakes up he is restrained and Andy and Nicole are there , trying
 to explain to him that Andy is working for the French, and that they are
 a couple now, intent on getting married officially once their work in Biafra
 is done.
 Not only that, but Andy explains how he had grown disenchanted with the
 British imperialistic way of doing things, and that he genuinely believes
 he is helping Biafrans in their fight for independence and justice.
 Ethan says bollocks to all that, spits on his brother and can't believe
 he actually sold everything off to save a traitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They leave things at that and Andy tells his brother that he hopes he comes
 around soon or else there will be no place for him there and he would have
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

get rid of him
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In reality, Andy is a double agent working for MI6 (unbeknownst to Ian who
 could not have known that -- only handlers know such info), having infiltrated
 the French agency, supplying the british with detailed information about
 the plans and operations of the French, and waiting for the opportune time
 to bring all the french operations in Biafra to an end, effectively leaving
 the Biafrans without any outside help, and bringing the war one step closer
 to the end with the Nigerians and their friends the British on the winning
 end, awarding the oil contracts to the british.
 He arranges it so that Ethan can get out of his bonds and gives him a chance
 to escape unharmed and without alerting someone.
 That way he hopes that his brother will finally get away from his own affairs
 without jeopardising or hampering his mission, and with an added bonus,
 the french operations will be disrupted while they relocate their base
 of operations.
 The problem arises when Ethan does not think of it that way, and instead
 takes it upon himself to kill Nicole and as many French agents and collaborator
s as he can.
 When he kills Nicole, Andy is outraged: Ethan had terminated the efforts
 and work of many months with one stroke, at the wrong time.
 Andy tells him who he really is and Ethan is stunned, unable to believe.
 When he is told details and truths and shown his radio signals, Ethan finally
 believes his brother (with some good old look-me-in-the-eye fashion), and
 offers their route of escape, James.
 While they set some explosives to go off, at least maximizing the damage
 and then going off to the LZ, they are discovered and a small hunt begins,
 trying to save their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they finally reach the LZ and wait for the chopper to salvation, exchanging
 fire from a long distance, James is seen in the pilot's seat alone.
 When he touches down the chopper and the two brothers run towards it, he
 opens up the door and puts a bullet squarely through Andy's head.
 Ethan is stunned, and while James is pointing the gun at him, between tears
 and babbling, confused and overwhelmed by contrasting emotions, James retells
 Ethan how he has exacted his revenge by killing Ethan's brother, just like
 Ethan had killed his own a few years ago.
 Ethan gets into a fight with James and finally kills him.
 He is left alone in a jungle clearing with the chopper still whirring its
 blades slowly and the French still after him, his brother and his best
 friend dead beside him.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a training with Marines from the 3rd Marine Division, Ethan Whittmore
 is told by his friend James Dwele that he has had some news about his brother.
 Ethan had lost contact with his brother and had asked James to find out
 what he could, as he is the intelligence officer of the division Ethan
 is attached to as a military advisor.
 James and Ethan discuss what can be done about Andy, and Ethan proposes
 that he should go in search of his brother, bringing the example of James'
 brother who had died in Kenya and James himself was unable to help.
 Some of Ethan's exploits are discussed but he seems reluctant to talk about
 these, while James in effect traps Ethan into finding Andy so he can exact
 his revenge.
 James promises he will try and keep in touch with Ethan and they arrange
 codes and radio frequencies.
 James also says he will try to cover for Ethan but thinks that he will
 not be able to buy enought time.
 Ethan believes he can arrange a cover, and does so via a friend in the
 MI6, Ian Ruthers.
 By the end of the chapter, James and Ethan shake hands and Ethan starts
 off with the caravan, a few range rovers, local volunteers and red cross
 personnel from various countries, while his cover is Richard Owls, a journalist
 for the London Times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Well met on an ill road
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The next couple of days pass rather languidly, the backdrop of the civil
 war and the jungle scenery featuring prominently until the caravan stops
 at a catholic monastery for supply and rest, as well as local info that
 should help them to avoid fighting and reach their intended destination
 (some local town) with relative safety.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole, and he finds out some direct info about his
 brother, believing at first that Nicole is indeed a nurse who had a relationshi
p with his brother.
 By the end of the chapter, Nicole is seen contacting Andy discussing a
 course of action, revealing her identity as an French agent to the reader,
 as well as seeing that the monastery is a cache/hideout for the French
 and an exchange point for Biafrans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Right before setting out the next day, at dawn, the monastery is attacked
 by a local warlord and his group of bandits (just because he had found
 out that Biafrans are supplied from such a place and equipment and ammo
 can be found there).
 The red cross caravan is cut down by fire, while Ethan puts his skills
 to use, and after most of the personnel is dead, and while the bandits
 begin their search for the cache, Ethan cuts the throat of the warlord,
 arms himself with an assault rifle and through hiding and shooting, takes
 down more than a couple of bandits, the rest of which decide things are
 already going badly for them, and flee into the jungle.
 After the firefight, Ethan helps with the bodies after which the nuns that
 are left alive pack their few belongings and decide to leave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Heed no prayer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The caravan is now non-existent and the few survivors terrified rush back
 to Nigeria.
 Ethan has no cover now, and while thinking ways of reaching Biafra through
 the jungle, Nicole acts according to plan, which is to safely remove Ethan
 from the picture.
 Knowing his brother would go after him no matter what, Andy had arranged
 for Nicole to set up the fake body, and while they would do that, wank
 him around a border town searching for clues that lead nowhere except the
 fake dead body of Andy, the idea being that Ethan would have thought his
 brother dead.
 Nicole then in order to perform that plan tells him that she is in fact
 a british agent (and perhaps that the cache that Ethan saw etc.
 was an english cache), and that her network of agents can help Ethan with
 hisn quest, so they set out together, to arrive the next couple of days
 to the small bordertown of LALA.
 During the trip through the jungle they witness the horrors of civil war,
 and while Nicole takes a humanist approach to the subject, she is seen
 knowing a lot about the politics involved in the matter (the oil fields
 etc.).
 Ethan seems focused on finding his brother and comes across as somewhat
 cynical and distant concerninc war and its atrocities.
 By the end of the chapter, they arrive at the small town, and sleep.
 When Ethan wakes up he finds the note with the contacts and a rendezvous
 point.
 He then thinks about what he had discussed with Nicole earlier and believes
 there's something awry with her (though she has detailed knowledge of Andy,
 she puts him off), and decides to phone Ian once more.
 Ian is disturbed by what Ethan tells him has happened, and promises to
 find out or whether or not there's an agent like Nicole in the area.
 Because he will be unable to safely deliver the message otherwise, he'll
 arrange something through the BBC (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 - something from their wartime past probably - a yes or no).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
5.
 Dead men can't dance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(this is the part where Ethan learns he is now considered AWOL, a turncoat
 for the biafrans etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole's contacts are pretty worthless, feeding Ethan disinformation, and
 making him go around in circles, finding out nothing new about his brother.
 By the time the rendezvous with Nicole comes up, it's 9 o'clock and it
 is now revealed to Ethan that Nicole is not who she claims to be.
 He keeps his cools and believes he is being lied to on purpose so that
 he cannot find his brother.
 When Nicole informs him his brother is in the morgue on LARGER_TOWN he
 believes there's something very rotten going on.
 He decides to hop along Nicole and some local who is both muscle and local
 expert, part of the supposed network.
 They go to the morgue and Ethan is shown the charred remains of an unidentified
 caucasian the same height and apparent bodyweight as his brother, with
 the correct fillings and some personal effects like his switchblade, pocket
 watch etc.
 Ethan for a few moments believes he might have erred, but then notices
 his brother's leg is not a bit shorter than the other, a birth defect that
 was almost imperceptible.
 He then notices an exposed collarbone that seemed perfectly shaped while
 his brother had cracked it at a small age, and it should have been noticeable.
 Thus Ethan now has proof that Nicole is indeed someone else and actively
 trying to divert him away from Andy.
 In tears she proposes that Ethan has nothing to do other than bury his
 brother tomorrow, and go home while there's still time to clear his name,
 something she promises she'll help with.
 Ethan plays along and they leave for a house that belonged to the local
 man (Adu Nebdele), and served as a place where they could use for operating
 (truthfully, as their french base of operations in LARGER_TOWN).
 At night, Ethan pretends to be sleeping and while prowling around the house,
 Adu catches him having found the radio creche and while at first he Acts
 as if nothing's wrong, when Ethan notices signals decoded/to be sent in
 french and british movement and nigerian charts, a fight ensues and Nicole
 wakes up.
 Ethan swiftly kills Adu and Nicole escapes him.
 He decides to take action and starts to round up the so-called network,
 while Nicole flees to contact Andy in person.

Ethan starts to terrorize the various contacts he had met before.
 Some yield the small value of info that they had been instructed to mislead
 him, some run before he can catch them, some die while trying to kill him
 and one of them is tortured and confesses the location of the french hideout
 in the jungle.
 Ethan travels to the location on foot only to find out it is an abandoned
 (the abandoned most possibly) red cross camp of his brother.
 While searching he finds out that the camp was a decoy and that there was
 a hidden underground entrance near a waterfall.
 Right before he tries to enter the complex, he is struck unconscious by
 his brother, and dragged inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 When Ethan wakes up, he is restrained to a chair, noticing the knots can
 be loosened over a few hours.
 He is not hurt, and his brother Andy and Nicole are trying to explain that
 they had simply tried to avoid him finding out Andy is an agent for the
 French, working in Biafra in order to help the biafrans achieve independence,
 and promote French interests in the oil industry.
 He and Nicole try to convince to work for them as well, and provide detailed
 info and feedback on British-Nigerian practices and plans, as well as train
 Biafrans to have an advantage over the Nigerians.
 Ethan refuses vehemently, Nicole is frustrated, and Andy leaves Ethan to
 think it over.
 In fact, Andy has arranged the knots to be easy to loose and a ready escape
 route for Ethan so he can get out of there alive and noe be part of the
 picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Instead Ethan decides to go after them both, and going into commando mode,
 kills Nicole while at the same time Andy sees him do it.
 By the end of the chapter, Andy is seen pointing a gun at Ethan calling
 him an idiot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
8.
 Andy explains to ethan that he is a double agent working for the British,
 feeding disinformation to the French, and trying to find the opportune
 time to blow up their whole operations in Biafra.
 Ethan is hard to believe it but in the end believes his brother and the
 proof he shows him.
 Now that everything has gone tits up, Ethan says he can still save them,
 and arrange an extraction via James.
 While he does so, their cover is blown and they start running for their
 lives, while the ETA is about an hour.
 In the ensuing firefights around the camp, some if it is blown off and
 then they start the run inside the jungle to the LZ.
 When the chopper finally arrives, the french are hot in their heels.
 James touches down, shoots Andy, tells Ethan the truth about him and his
 brother, Ethan kills him and is left with the chopper and the French behind
 him.

\begin_layout Standard
Ο ιδρώτας έτρεχε ελεύθερα στους κροτάφους του κοκκινομάλλη Εγγλέζου, απλώνοντας
 το καμουφλάζ σ'όλο το φρεσκοξυρισμένο του πρόσωπο.
 Μια λεπίδα μαχαιριού καλυμμένη με ξεραμένη λάσπη κάθοταν στο αριστερό τού
 χέρι, ενώ το άλλο χέρι του έκανε έναν περίπου κύκλο στον αέρα.
 Ήταν το σινιάλο για την εντολή να περικυκλωθεί ο στόχος.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Πέντε άντρες έγιναν ένα με την υγρή πράζινη ζούγκλα σε ένα καρδιοχτύπι,
 σαν να μην ήταν τίποτα άλλο παρά μια οφθαλμαπάτη.
 Κινούνταν γρήγορα, πιο γρήγορα απ'ότι νόμιζε ο Ήθαν ότι ήταν ικανοί.
 Αποφάσισε να καθήσει πίσω για λίγο ακόμα, και να δεί πώς θα μπορούσαν να
 χειριστούν την προσέγγιση τούς μόνοι τους.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Όλοι τους σταμάτησαν απότομα και σκύψαν χαμηλά όταν άκουσα θόρυβο, μάλλον
 από την κατεύθυνση του ξέφωτου μπροστά τούς.
 Οι δυό άντρες που σχημάτιζαν την άκρη της ομάδας στόχευσαν τα όπλα τούς
 προς τα έξω, σαν να έκλεισε ένας διακόπτης.
 Ο εμπροσθοφύλακας έγινε ένα με το έδαφος με τη μεταξένια χάρη μιάς γάτας,
 το μαχαίρι τού τραβηγμένο στο δεξί τού χέρι ενώ το αριστερό τού χέρι πήγε
 πρός το σαρανταπεντάρι Κόλτ.
 Η οπισθοφυλακή κινούταν σαν ένα ζευγάρι χορευτές, καλύπτοντας ο ένας την
 πλάτη του άλλου, και οι δυό τους σημαδεύοντας το όπλα τούς από το ύψος
 του ώμου, απασφαλισμένα στην επιλογή βολή κατά βολή.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Σε αυτό το προσεκτικό μικρό σχηματισμό διαμαντιού κινούνταν σάν σύνολο,
 κάθε βήμα μπροστά γίνονταν με εξασκημένη ευκολία και δίκαιολογημένη αυτοπεποίθη
ση, το σημάδι ενός καλοεκπαιδευμένου στρατιώτη.
 Για κάθε σκοπό, και όσο ένοιζε τον Ήθαν, είχε κάνει καλή δουλειά στην εκπαίδευσ
η τούς.
 Αυτό που τον έτρωγε όμως ακόμη ήταν ότι ακόμα δεν είχαν πυροβολήσει εν
 θερμώ.
 Ήξερε ότι τίποτα δεν δοκιμάζει έναν άνδρα όπως η αληθινή μάχη.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Παρ'όλο που κινούνταν ακριβώς όπως έιχαν διδαχθεί, και μοιάζαν αρκετά γρήγοροι
 και απαρατήρητοι, ο Ήθαν δεν μπορούσε να πεί εάν απλά κάνανε ό,τι κάνανε
 απο συνήθεια ή άν αλήθεια ήταν έτοιμοι για την πρόκληση.
 Άλλωστε, όσες πρόβες και άν κάνει κάποιος πρίν απο μια παράσταση, είναι
 η νύχτα της πρεμιέρας που την καθιερώνει ή την θάβει.

Το ελεύθερο χέρι του Ήθαν ήταν σφιχτά τυλιγμένο γύρω μια μεταλλική σκανδάλη

 ένα κουτί τσιγάρα από το οποίο μια δέσμη καλωδίων εξείχε και χάνονταν κάπου
 κάτω από την πλούσια πράσινη και καφετιά ταπετσαρία της ζούγκλας.
 Μέ ένα σφιχτό, έντονο χαμόγελο, ο Ήθαν ψιθύρισε στον εαυτό τού με την προσδοκία
 μιάς επιτυχούς επιχείρησης:

Όταν διπλοπάτησε την σκανδάλη, το πρώτο πράγμα που τράβηξε την προσοχή όλων
 ήταν οι λάμψεις.
 Και μετά ήρθαν τα ωστικά κύματα, η δύναμη τους να σφυροκοπάει τους πάντες,
 κάνοντας τα πλευρά ολονών να δονούνται βίαια, σαν να υπέφεραν από ρίγη.
 Και αυτήν ήταν μόνο η πρώτη νότα.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Πυρά όπλων μικρού διαμετρήματος ξεκίνησαν από διάφορες καλοτοποθετημένες

 σαν εκατοντάδες φωτογράφων που πάταγαν κλικ με ταχεία διαδοχή.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Οι ανιχνευτές βούτηξαν για κάλυψη στιγμιαία, πέφτωντας μπρούμυτα κρατώντας
 ταυτόχρονα τα τόξα πυρός τούς σταθερά παγιωμένα στην ιδιαίτερη ζώνη ευθύνη
 τούς.
 Ένα ειρωνικό χαμόγελο σχηματίστηκε στο πρόσωπο του Ήθαν: φαινόταν να απολαμβάνε
ι την ερμηνεία.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Οι πέντε εκπαιδευόμενοι κάθονταν στις κοιλιές τούς, κυλιόντας το κορμί τους
 και ερπόμενοι στο έδαφος της ζούγκλας σε μια προσπάθεια να βρούν όσο το
 δυνατόν περισσότερη κάλυψη σε ελάχιστες στιγμές.
 Αντάλλαξαν γρήγορες ματιές και έκαναν επαναλαμβανόμενες χειρονομίες ο ένας
 στον άλλον, επικοινώντας αθόρυβα, προσπαθώντας να θέσουν ένα σημείο στο
 οποίο μπορούσαν να υποχωρήσουν μακριά από τα όπλα που έβαλλαν εναντίον
 τούς μανιωδώς.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Κάθε κορμός δέντρου και χαμηλός θάμνος ή βαθύ χαντάκι άξιζε χρυσάφι τέτοιες
 στιγμές, και οι πέντε ανιχνευτές Πεζονάυτες από την 3η Μεραρχία Πεζοναυτών
 κάνανε εξαιρετική χρήση του περιβάλλοντος τούς.
 Τόσο πολύ που ο Ήθαν ένιωσε ένα τσίμπημα περηφάνειας βλέποντας την χειροτεχνία
 τού σε δράση.
 Ήταν άνδρες τού, και φαίνονταν ακριβώς τόσο επαγγελματίας όσο σκόπευε να
 είναι.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Γρήγορα εγκατέλειψαν την εκτεθειμένη θέση τούς για ένα ελαφρώς ρηχό χαμήλωμα
 του εδάφους με καλή κάλυψη, χοντρούς κορμούς δέντρων τριγύρω, πυκνούς θάμνους
 και καθαρή άποψη προς όλες τις μεριές.
 Μια θέση την οποία μπορούσαν να αμυνθούν, από την οποία μπορούσαν εύκολα
 να παρατηρήσουν μια κίνηση εναντίον τούς και να υποχωρήσουν ενόσω θα παρενοχλού
σαν τον εχθρό τούς, πυροβολώντας και κινούμενοι με τη σειρά.
 Στο μυαλό του ο Ήθαν ξαφνικά αντιλήφθηκε ότι ήταν αρκετά καλοί για να είναι
 ανιχνευτές των Βασιλικών Πεζοναυτών, όχι απλά Νιγηριανά στρατεύματα.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Σχεδόν ένιωσε ότι θα το μετάνιωνε επειδή δε θα μπορούσε να είναι εκεί μαζί
 τούς όταν μέτραγε αλήθεια, όταν τα όπλα που θα στρέφονταν εναντίον τούς
 δεν θα ήταν γεμάτα άσφαιρα, όταν τα εκρηκτικά μισό μίλι μακριά θα ήταν
 αληθινές οβίδες και όλμοι που θα πεφτανε ακριβώς πάνω τούς.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Το `Σχεδόν', καθώς ο Ήθαν υπενθύμισε στον εαυτό τού μες στο μυαλό τού, ήταν
 η πρωθύστερη λέξη.
 Αυτός δεν ήταν ο πόλεμος τού, ούτε κατά τύχη, και το να στήνει ψεύτικες
 εμπλοκές σαν και αυτήν ήταν όσο πιο κοντά ήθελε να πάει σε άλλη μια ζώνη
 πολέμου.
 Εκτός από τις φορές που είχε φαγούρα, εκτός από τις φορές που ξύπναγε μέσ'την
 μέση της νύχτας βουτηγμένος στον ιδρώτα, γνωρίζοντας ότι δεν ήταν η τροπική
 ζέστη που τον άφηνε άυπνο απο κει και μετά, αλλά πρόσωπα πολύ καλά καθορισμένα
 και ενθυμούμενα.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Η ομάδα των πέντε ανδρών είχε εδραιωθεί καλά, έχοντας σίγουρη κάλυψη.
 Οι πυροβολισμοί σταμάτησαν σύντομα, και ο Ήθαν πίστευε ότι δεν υπήρχε νόημα
 στο να συνεχίσουν την ιχνηλάτηση και να διασχίσουν την ζούγκλα.
 Είχε δεί ό,τι ήθελε να δεί, και αυτό ήταν μια ομάδα ανιχνευτών, όχι ένα
 τσούρμο πολεμοχαρών Νιγηριανών να αλλαλάζουν με τα όπλα να πυροβολούν κατα
 ριπάς, διψώντας για το αίμα των 'Ιγκμπο.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ο Ήθαν σηκώθηκε πάνω από τους θάμνους και φώναξε σαν να ήθελε οι δόκιμοι

Παρ'ολα αυτά τίποτα δεν μπορούσε να ακουστεί πλέον εκτός από τους συνηθισμένους
 ήχους της ζούγκλας, τις απόμακρες κραυγές των πουλιών και των μαιμούδων,
 και το συνεχές βούϊσμα κουνουπιών και άλλων λοιπών εξωτικών εντόμων.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ο Ήθαν συνωφρυώθηκε και αναλογίστηκε εν συντομία ότι η ομάδα θα μπορούσε
 να είχε στην πραγματικότητα εξαχθεί χωρίς να το είχε αντιληφθεί, και αποφάσισε
 να ελέγξει το μικρό χαμήλωμα μόνος τού.
 Με ένα βεβιασμένο βήμα, έκανε δρόμο μέσα από τους θάμνους και σε μερικές
 στιγμές έφτασε στην θέση στην οποία τούς είχε δεί τελευταία φορά να καλύπτονται.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Δεν είδε κανέναν, αλλά ξαφνικά αισθάνθηκε ένα κομμάτι μέταλλο να τον προγγίζει
 από την αριστερή τού μεριά, ακριβώς ανάμεσα στα πλευρά τού, πανέτοιμο να
 διατρήσει την καρδιά τού με μια και μόνο ώθηση.
 Είχε πιαστεί ανέτοιμος, και μόλις κοίταξε πλάγια αυτόν που του επιτέθηκε,
 είδε τον Όνκο, τον αρχηγό της ομάδας ανιχνευτών να χαμογελάει άγρια, τα
 λαμπερά λευκά δόντια τού μια έντονη αντίθεση με το καμουφλαρισμένο σκούρο
 πρόσωπο τού.
 Λίγο αποσβολωμένος και λίγο έκπληκτος, ο Ήθαν μετά βίας είχε χρόνο να ρίξει
 μια βρισιά:

Ο Όνκο τότε έβαλε το μαχαίρι στη θήκη για ακόμα μια φορά, και οι άλλοι τέσσερεις
 άντρες εμφανίστηκαν ξαφνικά απο αρκετά απίθανες και απομακρυσμένες μεριές,
 από κάθε μιά απο τις οποίες θα μπορούσαν να είχαν ρίξει μια σφαίρα στον
 Ήθαν με την ησυχία τούς.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ο Ήθαν έκανε ένα νεύμα με το κεφάλι και άφησε ένα μικρό αναστεναγμό, σαν
 να αναγνώριζε ότι είχε όντως χαλαρώσει την επιφυλακή τού και είχε νικηθεί,
 ακριβώς αυτό που μάθαινε στούς εκπαιδευόμενους τού ότι δεν πρέπει να συμβεί
 ποτέ, ακόμα και μακριά απο το πεδίο της μάχης.
 Το να καλλιεργεί κανείς λίγη παράνοια συνέφερε πολλά στο να κρατήσει έναν
 άντρα ζωντανό, ειδικά σε έναν εμφύλιο πόλεμο που το να ξεχωρίσεις έναν
 φίλο από έναν εχθρό δεν ήταν και τόσο ξεκάθαρη υπόθεση όσο το να πυροβολείς
 έναν.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ο Ήθαν κατάφερε να σώσει λίγο τις εντυπώσεις όμως όταν έδειξε στα πόδια

Ο Όνκο απέιχε πολύ απτο να χαμογελάει με αυτή την πληροφορία, και με μια

 κάνοντας το να ακουστεί σαν κατηγορία:

Δεν υπήρχε άλλο μέρος να υποχωρήσουμε και να καλυφθούμε, Λοχαγέ.

 Είχε απλά αποφασίσει να ευχαριστεί το Θεό που υπήρχε καλό ουϊσκι σε ένα
 μέρος σαν τη Νιγηρία και ακόμα περισσότερο σε ένα μπάρ σαν του Λούι.
 Αυτό που έκανε το μυαλό του Ήθαν να μουδιάζει ήταν ότι μπορούσε να βρεί
 καλό ουϊσκι εν μέσω ενός εμφυλίου πολέμου; μια κατάσταση που καθρεπτιζόταν

Ο Λούι κούνησε το κεφάλι τού με απογοήτευση και ξεκίνησε να γυαλίζει ένα

 Τα μάτια τού ήταν κολλημένα σε αυτό που έκανε την ώρα που απάντησε στον

 τού στο ρυθμό του τραγουδιού που έπαιζε από το τζούκμποξ.
 Μετά από μια μικρή άβολη σιωπή, είπε στον Λούι:

\begin_inset Quotes fld

Πρέπει να μοιάζει σα κλωτσιά στα μπαλάκια Λούι, αλλά δέν είναι τόσο άσχημα

 Ρίξε μια ματιά τριγύρω σου.
 Υπάρχουν μεγαλύτερα προβλήματα απο αυτούς τους δυό αλήτες.
 Άν όντως εμφανιστούν και το παίξουν σκληρά αφεντικά, θα φροντίσω να φάνε

 Οπότε βγάλτο αυτό απτο μυαλό σού.

Ο Λούι φάνηκε να ηρεμεί λίγο, το τεντωμένο του στόμα να χαλαρώενι σε ένα
 σφιχτό χαμόγελο.
 Πλησίασε ένα ψηλό ντουλάπι με κλειδαριά στα χερούλια, και χρησιμοποίησε
 ένα μικρό κλειδί που κρεμόταν από μια αλυσίδα γύρω απτο λαιμό τού.
 Άνοιξε το ντουλάπι με μικρές λεπτές κινήσεις των χεριών τού, σαν να άνοιγε
 μια εικόνα ή ένα ναό.
 Μέσα κάθονταν μια ντουζίνα μπουκάλια Cullough, σκονισμένα και χοντροκομμένα,
 κι απ'ότι φαινόταν εντελώς αυθεντικά με φελλό, σφραγίδα, τα πάντα.
 Στη θέα των μπουκαλιών του ουΐσκι και της πιθανότητας να τα γευτεί κατά
 την ευχέρεια τού, το πρόσωπο του Ήθαν φωτίστηκε και τα μπλέ μάτια τού φάνηκαν
 πρός στιγμήν να λαμπυρίζουν.
 Η φωνή τού δεν μπορούσε να συγκρατήσει τον ενθουσιασμό τού:

 όταν το όνομα του μεγαλύτερου σκοτσέζου που έζησε ποτέ ήταν ανήκουστο σε
 αυτή τη μεριά του κόσμου.
 Παρ'όλα αυτά όταν προσπάθησε να εξηγήσει στο Λούι, ίσιωσε την πλάτη τού
 σαν να απευθυνόταν στους λόρδους και τις κυρίες του Παλατιού του Μπάκινγχαμ.
 Η προφορά τού ξαφνικά έγινε βαρύτερη, τραβώντας κάποια γράμματα:

 Κοίταξε και έδειξε με το μακρύ κοκκαλιάρικο δείκτη τού έναν στιβαρό, ψηλό
 και γυμνασμένο μαύρο άντρα ντυμένο με παραλλαγές, ένας μπερές του Νιγηριανού
 Σώματος Πεζοναυτών να διακοσμεί κομψά το κεφάλι τού.
 Τα μάτια του άντρα διέσχισαν με μια βίαιη διάθεση την ομίχλη και την θολούρα

 Καθώς πλησίαζε το μπάρ, ο Ήθαν έκανε μιά χειρονομία πρός το ακόμα ανοιχτό

 τον πόλεμο ένα προσωπικό ζήτημα, κάτι το οποίο κάθε επαγγελματίας στρατιώτης
 προσπαθούσε να αποφύγει.
 Κάνοντας τον πόλεμο προσωπικό ζήτημα σήμαινει επίσης ότι κάποιος θα έκανε

James expression seemed to change somewhat.
 He removed his hands from the table and for a moment sat still, looking
 at Ethan intensely.
 He then ordered another drink from Loui, who seemingly kept a watchful
 eye at their table more so than other tables and nodded promptly, going
 at the back for a couple minutes.
 When James spoke next, he was lighting up Ethan's last cigarette, receiving
 nothing but the stunned surprise and deep furrow of Ethan:

Kenya, right.
 Nineteen sixty three.
 The yankees had just invaded Vietnam and my team had shipped out to Kenya
 as part of a counter-insurgency operation.
 The plan was to turn the various guerilla parties on each other, feeding
 disinformation and using scare tactics.
 We were supposed to make contact with a few loyalist bands, and organize
 a small force that would stop the insurrection in its heart.
 It was pretty complex, far-fetched and too optimistic.
 Very few men.
 No small wonder it failed.
 Of course that's not why we lost Kenya.

Ethan stopped for a moment when Loui came with James' new glass of wine.
 He picked up Ethan's empty glass and nodded with a wink, before leaving
 them alone once again.
 Somewhere in the opposite corner of the Metropolitaine a loud crashing
 noise was heard and Ethans fleeting gaze revealed the bunch of sailors
 strewn around over lots of broken glasses and a couple of upturned tables.
 A loud chorus of laughters was heard and once the noise resumed its regularly
 high levels, Ethan decided to go on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

We were trying to rendezvous with a loyalist cell in the <KENYA_REGION1>,
 scout out the area, evaluate targets and then organize a strike to disorganize
 and demoralise the local rebel cells.
 Guerilla warfare textbook case.
 Anyway, first couple of nights in the jungle, all fine and dandy; nothing
 but mosquitoes, fucking jungle weather and bad sleep, which was to be expected
 in the bloody jungle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

On the third night though, I woke up not with a kick in the me bollocks.
 I realise my hands are all tied up.
 Can't fucking believe what's going on; whole squad captured like a bunch
 of campers.
 The sentries were talking about the last fucking Millwall-Chelsea game.
 Long story short, we got caught with our pants down.
 They didn't kill us outright, that would have been stupid and of no use.
 The Kenyans needed leverage, public approval, anything that would convince
 the parliament to say `balls off with Kenya, it's not worth it'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
We were eleven men on that squad.
 At first I thought they would exchange us, but then we noticed we were
 going around in circles somewhere in <KENYA_REGION2>, nothing like a plan.
 Like a long range patrol or whatnot.
 Our heavy gunner, McKinley, tried to make a run for it one day.
 He stumbled and tripped, dropped twenty feet down a cliff and broke both
 his legs.
 Their leader, a big brute of a man, shot him in the back of the head.
 Even said he was being merciful.
 That was when fucking bells started ringing in our heads.

That cunt had it coming for him.
 We decided to have a go at them all together.
 We stopped for fresh water by a small river one day.
 While they were bathing, we ganged up on two of our guards.
 That's when I got stabbed in the knee and tore up the ligaments.
 Nobody died though.
 Except that man.
 I drowned that fucker.
 Held him down in the river till my hands turned blue and I couldn't feel
 them.
 First time I killed a man with my bare hands.
 We then hiked back through the jungle, the Kenyan's in tow.
 Debriefing them gave some insight into the area, but a fat lot of good
 that did in the end.
 I got a demerit for losing McKinley and getting captured.
 Should've been a major by now.

Ethan paused and drained his glass, real thirst driving him.
 James was looking at Ethan through bloodshot eyes, his glass of wine empty

 He sat upright in his chair, drew audibly through his large nostrils on
 the thick air of the Metropolitaine and made a hand signal for another
 round of drinks, making sure that Louis brought two glasses of Cullough.
 Ethan sat across him, his gaze fixed on the ceiling fan above them.
 He looked distantly thoughtful, even slightly grim.
 He turned his eyes to his empty glass and spoke with a touch of anger behind

 Its tall thick windows shone with the brightness of the noon sun when Ethan

 He eased down the main corridor, and without even answering a couple of

 Please, do have a seat.
 Now, what was it that you wanted to speak to me about? I believe on the
 phone you said it was an urgent personal matter that somehow involved my
 desk.
 Would you care to elaborate? I can only be of real help if I know what
 we're dealing with here, you know.
 In strictest of confidence, of course.

Ethan shook the hand but still felt somehow a little out of depth, his inherent
 distrust of spies kicking in despite the man's cordial manner.
 Unaccustomed to protocol and etiquette, Ethan dived straight into the matter
 and said:

Mr.

Isidor Bloom blinked once or twice with an unwavering smile, and seemingly
 quite baffled, replied:

I beg your pardon, what kind of cover are you talking about Mr.

Before Ethan had time to elaborate, Mr.
 Bloom had furrowed his brow, waving a `no-no' finger at Ethan.
 He got up from his chair and leisurely closed the door of his office.
 Ethan could only frown with genuine puzzlement while Mr.
 Bloom sat down again comfortably, lit his smoking pipe and had a puff.

Do you ask for a cunt when walking into a brothel, Mr.
 Whittmore? In such delicate matters, a little more room for maneuver is
 usually required.
 You'd ask for a girl or a woman, perhaps even some company.
 Not for a cunt, which is the reason for visiting a brothel.
 Are you following me, son?

Ethan looked ever more perplexed, especially by the sudden change of mood
 in the middle-aged man.
 He understood he had been too blunt, but while trying to think what to
 say next and especially how to apologise, the old spy got to him first:

Listen old chap, everybody knows what we're doing here, and everyone including
 us, knows we're just doing pottery and traditional art exhibitions.
 Thursday's bagpipe night, though.
 Savvy?

Ethan nodded numbly despite not actually understanding all too well what
 the man was trying to get at.
 Mr.

 continued:

To make things easier for you, and expediate the process.
 Is there someone I can call on your behalf? Someone who can help me, help

Yes, sir.

As suddenly as before, Mr.
 Bloom's attitude swapped back to his jovial, well-mannered and quite expedient
 self.
 Wearing an almost disconcertingly wide grin on his face, he picked up the
 phone on his desk, dialed a single number, and said:
\end_layout

Yes? Jenny? Put me through to Bristol.

A small wait ensued, which was reason enough for Ethan to start sweating
 even though the temperature inside the room was quite pleasant.
 Mr.
 Bloom kept smiling and nodding in a reassuring fashion, which only accentuated
 the feeling of weirdness and anxiety that had crept up over Ethan.
 Then, Mr.
 Bloom was heard talking over the phone:
\end_layout

Yes? Leonard? Yes, it's me Isidor.
 Long time no see, but it's business again I'm afraid.
 Is Ruthers one of yours? I see.
 Is he hot? No? Aha.
 Tell him to give me a call.
 Yes, my office.
 Well, now would be indeed a perfect time.
 I'd like to get on with this before lunch.
 Yes, well she's fine.
 Working on her garden.
 How's Marie? Loved her cherry pie last Christmas.
 Would love to, old chap.
 Have your man call me, alright then? Goodbye.

Once he hang up the phone, Mr.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fucking cunt can sod off.
 Now, let's clear a few things: This friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod off
 as well.
 If he's going to push something for me down my pipe, fine and all.
 I don't give fuckall about the why or how, I'm going home to Cheltenham
 before Christmas, and this desk can rot on my piss.
 And just so that you know, the cock around here tastes awful so brush often.
 Bloody poofters.

With that last weird and almost unintelligible remark, Mr.
 Bloom put out his pipe, placed it in his shirt pocket, picked up his hat
 and strolled out of his office, carefull to smoothly close the door behind
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly had transpired.
 The only certainty was that Mr.
 Bloom needed to get off that job of his badly.
 Ethan's thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing.
 Thinking it should be Ruthers on the other end of the phone, Ethan picked
 up the phone:

Hello? Ian? It's Ethan Whittmore.
 Well, I know.
 Didn't expect to hear me on this end, did you? What am I doing here? Well,
 first of all -- yes, I know I'm terrible.
 No, it wasn't -- I know I shouldn't be even talking to you like this but
 I need some help, Ian.
 No! I'm not married.
 Can you be serious for a minute? How you're working for Six I'll never
 understand.
 Well, now that I saw the guy in the Nigerian desk perhaps I do understand.
 Listen.
 Just listen.
 I need some cover.
 It's Andy, my brother.
 I need to go into Biafra.
 No joke.
 There will be no widow to comfort, so stop being a cunt and help me over
 here.
 Right, then.
 A piece of paper? I'm on it.

James rolled a cigarette.
 Real tobacco, confiscated from customs.
 A smile, a joke and a tap in the back will go a long way.
 Especially when you're six feet tall and slightly less stocky than a bull.
 That was something that Ethan had told him.
 A piece of wisdom from Britain's finest.

He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen table.
 Some fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly serrated set of tiny
 teeth.
 The smell of roast dominated the room and an open window showed the grill
 on the small porch, a few coals settling down, their heat meaningless in
 the summer night of Lagos.

A wedding feast was being held in the next street, the gathered crowd like
 a colourful centipede, dancing and singing like it had a mind of its own,
 however small.
 James peered mirthlessly at the small spectacle, and stared blankly for
 a minute or two, as if trying to remember a detail, a name or a place.

They brought the groom to the fore, all dressed up and smiling, and rained
 him with flowers and gifts, his face shining almost imperceptibly with
 a gold sheen that somehow seemed only natural under the light of the torches.

The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James' arm, and it shook instinctively,
 ash marking the spot of the slight burn.
 He didn't flinch though, nor did he notice his cigarette was out.
 The phone in the bedroom was ringing with a mindless persistence that a
 salesman would envy.

When James finally got up from his chair, the phone was ringing once more.
 He stormed outside dressed in nothing but shorts, and ran towards the moving
 wedding feast.
 As he ran, he wiped his tongue across his lips and couldn't know if he
 tasted his tears or his sweat the most.
