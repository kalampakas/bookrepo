\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a radical departure from the first book, for which writing a sequel seems
 untimely or perhaps even unwanted, I'm writing Blood Bonds (working title).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The story is set during the Biafran-Nigerian civil war, or Biafran war of
 independence (depending on whose side you're on or on your POV), and especially
 in 1968.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main protagonist, and what is later revealed to be a tragic figure is
 Ethan Whittmore, a captain of the Royal Marines and a British military
 advisor in Lagos, Nigeria.
 Ethan Whittmore has served in Kenya doing commando and paramilitary work
 of a dubious nature, having done things he is loathe to talk about and
 not especially proud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In Lagos he has befriended his Nigerian Liaison, James Dwele, a Major (?)
 in the Nigerian Army.
 Dwele's brother had fought in the Kenyan liberation struggle only a few
 years earlier, and had died at the very hands of Ethan.
 It was not until after they had become friends that James learned of Ethan's
 involvement, background and history.
 After an internal struggle he decided to wait in order to exact his revenge
 and did so in a methodical, cold and calculating manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Ethan's brother, Doctor Andy (Stanley?) Whittmore goes into Biafra
 with a Red Cross relief mission, Ethan tries to warn his brother and discourage
 him because of the dangers involved with going into a civil war.
 Andy is adamant and waves away his brother's fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a couple of months though, all contact between Ethan and Andy is lost.
 James runs some checks with Intelligence and informs Ethan that the red
 cross camp had been raided, most possibly by a local warlord, but there
 was not a single body of a caucasian to be found, suggesting that they
 either fleed deep into the jungle, unable to get to a town for help, or
 had been kept as prisoners to be ransomed at some point in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The essence of it was that Andy was somewhere in the Biafran jungle, most
 probably alive, but certainly in danger, if not already dead and buried
 somewhere in the jungle with no hope of ever finding a body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan is torn between duty and love for his younger brother, and after being
 urged by James, he decides to abandon his posting, go AWOL and search for
 his brother.
 In that undertaking, he counts on the help of James who will provide him
 with an extraction helicopter when and if Ethan locates Andy, as well as
 updates via radio of the movement and disposition of Nigerian and Biafran
 forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan contacts an acquaintance in MI6, Ian Ruthers, a war buddy from Kenya
 who owes him a favor or two, and arranges an identity as a journalist attached
 to a red cross caravan going into Biafra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once he sets out (not from Lagos but from a large red cross camp near the
 borders) and goes through the jungle, on the second day of their trek they
 stop for supplies and rest at a French Catholic monastery, run by a few
 nuns, some French, some local converts.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole Heurgot, a nurse who claims was part of a red
 cross caravan that was attacked, and her fleet brought her to the relative
 sanctuary and safety of the monastery.
 When Ethan introduces himself as who he really is tells her he is looking
 for his brother, she says to him that not only she knew Andy and they where
 on the same caravan, but that they were also lovers and she fears he might
 be dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In truth, Nicole is a french agent, working in league with Andy.
 After she happens upon Ethan, she notifies Andy via radio (the monastery
 also doubles as a cache and forward post for french intelligence operations
 in the area which involve providing equipment to the biafrans) about Ethan's
 search.
 Andy tells Nicole to wrangle his brother around, buy some time until he
 sends some personal effects from their jungle hideout to a nearby town,
 so that they can cook up a badly charred white caucasian body that could
 be Andy, and convince Ethan that Andy is dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the meantime, Ethan contacts James and finds out that he could not cover
 for him effectively, and trying to fake his leave of absence did not work
 out.
 He has been marked as AWOL and a court-martial and certain stripping of
 rank awaits him when he returns.
 As far as the Nigerians are concerned, they fear he has turned over to
 the Biafrans, and is considered an enemy of the state to be shot on sight.
 With his own government washing its hands off him and the Nigerians who
 he had been training considering him a traitor, Ethan has nowhere to go
 back to.
 His only purpose and reason now is to find his brother, dead or alive,
 and then try to vanish somewhere else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At that point the monastery is attacked by a local warlord, and Ethan single
 handedly kills a couple of them as well as the warlord, but even though
 the rest of the bandits flee, many of the red cross men and women have
 been killed, and the rest refuse to go on and simply try to make it back
 to Nigeria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Without a valid cover Ethan then asks for Nicole's help, which she seems
 to give willingly, out of concern for Andy.
 When Ethan explains that there's nothing left for him behind, and while
 already on their way to the closest town past the borders, she reveals
 to Ethan that she is actually a British agent working under cover in Biafra,
 and she is confident that her network of agents will be able to at least
 find out if Andy is alive, and even perhaps his whereabouts.
 Not only that, but she is confident she can smuggle Ethan out of the country
 and perhaps clear his name, so that Ethan has one more reason to stick
 with her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they arrive at the bordertown, they settle for the night in a shanty
 hotel.
 When Ethan wakes up, he finds out that Nicole has gone and has left him
 a note with some contacts whom he must talk with, and arranges a meeting
 in a safehouse, because of pressing business.
 In truth, Nicole left to arrange the duping of the body and the various
 contacts that are supposed to feed Ethan with false information, have him
 go around in circles only to have him find out his brother is dead in the
 morgue (a fake body).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While Nicole is away, Ethan in the back of his head is always alert and
 distrustful especially now that he believes the only man he can trust is
 James, and the only man who might actually have an escape route available.
 He contacts his MI6 man in dire need, asking to know whether or not there
 is a woman like Nicole working for the british in biafra.
 Though reluctantly, his buddy Ian tells him he'll have to do a search.
 He arranges it so that he passes a 'yes' or 'no' message via the BBC, the
 next night (perhaps a specific song, or a glitch in the clock beeps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The contact spot is a bar, where Ethan receives the message from BBC radio
 that Nicole is not who she claims she is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole, gives him the bad news that Andy is dead, his body in the morgue,
 charred and almost unrecognizable but for his dental fillings, harmonica
 and switchblade with his initials and Eton insignia (or whatnot).
 Ethan is convinced he is being lied to because his brother had a slightly
 smaller hip (or whatnot) that seemed okay in this body.
 Ethan does not openly express himself, but seems withdrawn and in mourning,
 while heavily contemplating his next move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole weeps convincingly enough, and says to Ethan that tomorrow morning
 she'll arrange passage for Ethan first to (african state bordering south
 nigeria) and then on to South Africa where he might have a better luck
 clearing his name with the army.
 For that night, they'll sleep together in the safehouse with the local
 biafran man that acts as her bodyguard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ethan times his attack well and catches the man off-guard.
 In the fight that ensues, the man is killed and Nicole gets away.
 Rummaging through the man's belongings he finds a few clues (key, receipts
 etc.) that lead him to expose Nicole's network as what it really is, a french
 network of agents.
 ONe of them also coughs up the location of the jungle HQ/hideout, where
 Ethan decides to go next, believing that he had been sidetracked on purpose,
 and a fake body of Andy was indeed proof that he was alive and certainly
 their prisoner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When he arrives at the site he finds out a red cross deserted camp, similar
 to what his brother's camp should have been.
 Trying to search for more clues, he is attacked suddenly and rendered unconscio
us, by his own brother Andy.
 When he wakes up he is restrained and Andy and Nicole are there , trying
 to explain to him that Andy is working for the French, and that they are
 a couple now, intent on getting married officially once their work in Biafra
 is done.
 Not only that, but Andy explains how he had grown disenchanted with the
 British imperialistic way of doing things, and that he genuinely believes
 he is helping Biafrans in their fight for independence and justice.
 Ethan says bollocks to all that, spits on his brother and can't believe
 he actually sold everything off to save a traitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They leave things at that and Andy tells his brother that he hopes he comes
 around soon or else there will be no place for him there and he would have
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

get rid of him
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In reality, Andy is a double agent working for MI6 (unbeknownst to Ian who
 could not have known that -- only handlers know such info), having infiltrated
 the French agency, supplying the british with detailed information about
 the plans and operations of the French, and waiting for the opportune time
 to bring all the french operations in Biafra to an end, effectively leaving
 the Biafrans without any outside help, and bringing the war one step closer
 to the end with the Nigerians and their friends the British on the winning
 end, awarding the oil contracts to the british.
 He arranges it so that Ethan can get out of his bonds and gives him a chance
 to escape unharmed and without alerting someone.
 That way he hopes that his brother will finally get away from his own affairs
 without jeopardising or hampering his mission, and with an added bonus,
 the french operations will be disrupted while they relocate their base
 of operations.
 The problem arises when Ethan does not think of it that way, and instead
 takes it upon himself to kill Nicole and as many French agents and collaborator
s as he can.
 When he kills Nicole, Andy is outraged: Ethan had terminated the efforts
 and work of many months with one stroke, at the wrong time.
 Andy tells him who he really is and Ethan is stunned, unable to believe.
 When he is told details and truths and shown his radio signals, Ethan finally
 believes his brother (with some good old look-me-in-the-eye fashion), and
 offers their route of escape, James.
 While they set some explosives to go off, at least maximizing the damage
 and then going off to the LZ, they are discovered and a small hunt begins,
 trying to save their lives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they finally reach the LZ and wait for the chopper to salvation, exchanging
 fire from a long distance, James is seen in the pilot's seat alone.
 When he touches down the chopper and the two brothers run towards it, he
 opens up the door and puts a bullet squarely through Andy's head.
 Ethan is stunned, and while James is pointing the gun at him, between tears
 and babbling, confused and overwhelmed by contrasting emotions, James retells
 Ethan how he has exacted his revenge by killing Ethan's brother, just like
 Ethan had killed his own a few years ago.
 Ethan gets into a fight with James and finally kills him.
 He is left alone in a jungle clearing with the chopper still whirring its
 blades slowly and the French still after him, his brother and his best
 friend dead beside him.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 In her Majesty's service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
After a training with Marines from the 3rd Marine Division, Ethan Whittmore
 is told by his friend James Dwele that he has had some news about his brother.
 Ethan had lost contact with his brother and had asked James to find out
 what he could, as he is the intelligence officer of the division Ethan
 is attached to as a military advisor.
 James and Ethan discuss what can be done about Andy, and Ethan proposes
 that he should go in search of his brother, bringing the example of James'
 brother who had died in Kenya and James himself was unable to help.
 Some of Ethan's exploits are discussed but he seems reluctant to talk about
 these, while James in effect traps Ethan into finding Andy so he can exact
 his revenge.
 James promises he will try and keep in touch with Ethan and they arrange
 codes and radio frequencies.
 James also says he will try to cover for Ethan but thinks that he will
 not be able to buy enought time.
 Ethan believes he can arrange a cover, and does so via a friend in the
 MI6, Ian Ruthers.
 By the end of the chapter, James and Ethan shake hands and Ethan starts
 off with the caravan, a few range rovers, local volunteers and red cross
 personnel from various countries, while his cover is Richard Owls, a journalist
 for the London Times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Well met on an ill road
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The next couple of days pass rather languidly, the backdrop of the civil
 war and the jungle scenery featuring prominently until the caravan stops
 at a catholic monastery for supply and rest, as well as local info that
 should help them to avoid fighting and reach their intended destination
 (some local town) with relative safety.
 There, Ethan meets Nicole, and he finds out some direct info about his
 brother, believing at first that Nicole is indeed a nurse who had a relationshi
p with his brother.
 By the end of the chapter, Nicole is seen contacting Andy discussing a
 course of action, revealing her identity as an French agent to the reader,
 as well as seeing that the monastery is a cache/hideout for the French
 and an exchange point for Biafrans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Right before setting out the next day, at dawn, the monastery is attacked
 by a local warlord and his group of bandits (just because he had found
 out that Biafrans are supplied from such a place and equipment and ammo
 can be found there).
 The red cross caravan is cut down by fire, while Ethan puts his skills
 to use, and after most of the personnel is dead, and while the bandits
 begin their search for the cache, Ethan cuts the throat of the warlord,
 arms himself with an assault rifle and through hiding and shooting, takes
 down more than a couple of bandits, the rest of which decide things are
 already going badly for them, and flee into the jungle.
 After the firefight, Ethan helps with the bodies after which the nuns that
 are left alive pack their few belongings and decide to leave.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Heed no prayer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The caravan is now non-existent and the few survivors terrified rush back
 to Nigeria.
 Ethan has no cover now, and while thinking ways of reaching Biafra through
 the jungle, Nicole acts according to plan, which is to safely remove Ethan
 from the picture.
 Knowing his brother would go after him no matter what, Andy had arranged
 for Nicole to set up the fake body, and while they would do that, wank
 him around a border town searching for clues that lead nowhere except the
 fake dead body of Andy, the idea being that Ethan would have thought his
 brother dead.
 Nicole then in order to perform that plan tells him that she is in fact
 a british agent (and perhaps that the cache that Ethan saw etc.
 was an english cache), and that her network of agents can help Ethan with
 hisn quest, so they set out together, to arrive the next couple of days
 to the small bordertown of LALA.
 During the trip through the jungle they witness the horrors of civil war,
 and while Nicole takes a humanist approach to the subject, she is seen
 knowing a lot about the politics involved in the matter (the oil fields
 etc.).
 Ethan seems focused on finding his brother and comes across as somewhat
 cynical and distant concerninc war and its atrocities.
 By the end of the chapter, they arrive at the small town, and sleep.
 When Ethan wakes up he finds the note with the contacts and a rendezvous
 point.
 He then thinks about what he had discussed with Nicole earlier and believes
 there's something awry with her (though she has detailed knowledge of Andy,
 she puts him off), and decides to phone Ian once more.
 Ian is disturbed by what Ethan tells him has happened, and promises to
 find out or whether or not there's an agent like Nicole in the area.
 Because he will be unable to safely deliver the message otherwise, he'll
 arrange something through the BBC (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 - something from their wartime past probably - a yes or no).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
5.
 Dead men can't dance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(this is the part where Ethan learns he is now considered AWOL, a turncoat
 for the biafrans etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nicole's contacts are pretty worthless, feeding Ethan disinformation, and
 making him go around in circles, finding out nothing new about his brother.
 By the time the rendezvous with Nicole comes up, it's 9 o'clock and it
 is now revealed to Ethan that Nicole is not who she claims to be.
 He keeps his cools and believes he is being lied to on purpose so that
 he cannot find his brother.
 When Nicole informs him his brother is in the morgue on LARGER_TOWN he
 believes there's something very rotten going on.
 He decides to hop along Nicole and some local who is both muscle and local
 expert, part of the supposed network.
 They go to the morgue and Ethan is shown the charred remains of an unidentified
 caucasian the same height and apparent bodyweight as his brother, with
 the correct fillings and some personal effects like his switchblade, pocket
 watch etc.
 Ethan for a few moments believes he might have erred, but then notices
 his brother's leg is not a bit shorter than the other, a birth defect that
 was almost imperceptible.
 He then notices an exposed collarbone that seemed perfectly shaped while
 his brother had cracked it at a small age, and it should have been noticeable.
 Thus Ethan now has proof that Nicole is indeed someone else and actively
 trying to divert him away from Andy.
 In tears she proposes that Ethan has nothing to do other than bury his
 brother tomorrow, and go home while there's still time to clear his name,
 something she promises she'll help with.
 Ethan plays along and they leave for a house that belonged to the local
 man (Adu Nebdele), and served as a place where they could use for operating
 (truthfully, as their french base of operations in LARGER_TOWN).
 At night, Ethan pretends to be sleeping and while prowling around the house,
 Adu catches him having found the radio creche and while at first he Acts
 as if nothing's wrong, when Ethan notices signals decoded/to be sent in
 french and british movement and nigerian charts, a fight ensues and Nicole
 wakes up.
 Ethan swiftly kills Adu and Nicole escapes him.
 He decides to take action and starts to round up the so-called network,
 while Nicole flees to contact Andy in person.

Ethan starts to terrorize the various contacts he had met before.
 Some yield the small value of info that they had been instructed to mislead
 him, some run before he can catch them, some die while trying to kill him
 and one of them is tortured and confesses the location of the french hideout
 in the jungle.
 Ethan travels to the location on foot only to find out it is an abandoned
 (the abandoned most possibly) red cross camp of his brother.
 While searching he finds out that the camp was a decoy and that there was
 a hidden underground entrance near a waterfall.
 Right before he tries to enter the complex, he is struck unconscious by
 his brother, and dragged inside.

 When Ethan wakes up, he is restrained to a chair, noticing the knots can
 be loosened over a few hours.
 He is not hurt, and his brother Andy and Nicole are trying to explain that
 they had simply tried to avoid him finding out Andy is an agent for the
 French, working in Biafra in order to help the biafrans achieve independence,
 and promote French interests in the oil industry.
 He and Nicole try to convince to work for them as well, and provide detailed
 info and feedback on British-Nigerian practices and plans, as well as train
 Biafrans to have an advantage over the Nigerians.
 Ethan refuses vehemently, Nicole is frustrated, and Andy leaves Ethan to
 think it over.
 In fact, Andy has arranged the knots to be easy to loose and a ready escape
 route for Ethan so he can get out of there alive and noe be part of the
 picture.

Instead Ethan decides to go after them both, and going into commando mode,
 kills Nicole while at the same time Andy sees him do it.
 By the end of the chapter, Andy is seen pointing a gun at Ethan calling
 him an idiot.

 Andy explains to ethan that he is a double agent working for the British,
 feeding disinformation to the French, and trying to find the opportune
 time to blow up their whole operations in Biafra.
 Ethan is hard to believe it but in the end believes his brother and the
 proof he shows him.
 Now that everything has gone tits up, Ethan says he can still save them,
 and arrange an extraction via James.
 While he does so, their cover is blown and they start running for their
 lives, while the ETA is about an hour.
 In the ensuing firefights around the camp, some if it is blown off and
 then they start the run inside the jungle to the LZ.
 When the chopper finally arrives, the french are hot in their heels.
 James touches down, shoots Andy, tells Ethan the truth about him and his
 brother, Ethan kills him and is left with the chopper and the French behind
 him.

Ethan put out his cigarette, drank the rest of his drink in one go and motioned
 his empty glass to Loui who seemed to notice almost immediately.

 He tried to calm himself and find the appropriate words:

 Though I still think it's stupid, at least he acted like the man he's supposed
 to be.
 He wanted to help, he signed up with the Red Cross.

There was a pause.
 Loui was returning to their table with Ethan's refill of Cullough, and
 a clean ashtray.
 Ethan took his time before continuing, and nodded his thanks to Loui who
 bowed slightly and fleeted off to serve some other corner in the Metropolitaine.
 James had rested his arms on the table, his frame and build too large to
 comfortably seat himself in the Metropolitaine's simple chairs.
 Ethan took a mouthful of Cullough and flinched when he felt it burn down
 through his throat and into his stomach.

 eye at their table more so than other tables and nodded promptly, going
 at the back for a couple minutes.
 When James spoke next, he was lighting up Ethan's last cigarette, receiving
 nothing but the stunned surprise and deep furrow of Ethan:

Kenya, right.
 Nineteen sixty three.
 The yankees had just invaded Vietnam and my team had shipped out to Kenya
 as part of a counter-insurgency operation.
 The plan was to turn the various guerilla parties on each other, feeding
 disinformation and using scare tactics.
 We were supposed to make contact with a few loyalist bands, and organize
 a small force that would stop the insurrection in its heart.
 It was pretty complex, far-fetched and too optimistic.
 Very few men.
 No small wonder it failed.
 Of course that's not why we lost Kenya.

Ethan stopped for a moment when Loui came with James' new glass of wine.
 He picked up Ethan's empty glass and nodded with a wink, before leaving
 them alone once again.
 Somewhere in the opposite corner of the Metropolitaine a loud crashing
 noise was heard and Ethans fleeting gaze revealed the bunch of sailors
 strewn around over lots of broken glasses and a couple of upturned tables.
 A loud chorus of laughters was heard and once the noise resumed its regularly
 high levels, Ethan decided to go on:

We were trying to rendezvous with a loyalist cell in the <KENYA_REGION1>,
 scout out the area, evaluate targets and then organize a strike to disorganize
 and demoralise the local rebel cells.
 Guerilla warfare textbook case.
 Anyway, first couple of nights in the jungle, all fine and dandy; nothing
 but mosquitoes, fucking jungle weather and bad sleep, which was to be expected
 in the bloody jungle.

On the third night though, I woke up not with a kick in the me bollocks.
 I realise my hands are all tied up.
 Can't fucking believe what's going on; whole squad captured like a bunch
 of campers.
 The sentries were talking about the last fucking Millwall-Chelsea game.
 Long story short, we got caught with our pants down.
 They didn't kill us outright, that would have been stupid and of no use.
 The Kenyans needed leverage, public approval, anything that would convince
 the parliament to say `balls off with Kenya, it's not worth it'.

We were eleven men on that squad.
 At first I thought they would exchange us, but then we noticed we were
 going around in circles somewhere in <KENYA_REGION2>, nothing like a plan.
 Like a long range patrol or whatnot.
 Our heavy gunner, McKinley, tried to make a run for it one day.
 He stumbled and tripped, dropped twenty feet down a cliff and broke both
 his legs.
 Their leader, a big brute of a man, shot him in the back of the head.
 Even said he was being merciful.
 That was when fucking bells started ringing in our heads.

That cunt had it coming for him.
 We decided to have a go at them all together.
 We stopped for fresh water by a small river one day.
 While they were bathing, we ganged up on two of our guards.
 That's when I got stabbed in the knee and tore up the ligaments.
 Nobody died though.
 Except that man.
 I drowned that fucker.
 Held him down in the river till my hands turned blue and I couldn't feel
 them.
 First time I killed a man with my bare hands.
 We then hiked back through the jungle, the Kenyan's in tow.
 Debriefing them gave some insight into the area, but a fat lot of good
 that did in the end.
 I got a demerit for losing McKinley and getting captured.
 Should've been a major by now.

Ethan paused and drained his glass, real thirst driving him.
 James was looking at Ethan through bloodshot eyes, his glass of wine empty
 once more.
 He sat upright in his chair, drew audibly through his large nostrils on
 the thick air of the Metropolitaine and made a hand signal for another
 round of drinks, making sure that Louis brought two glasses of Cullough.
 Ethan sat across him, his gaze fixed on the ceiling fan above them.
 He looked distantly thoughtful, even slightly grim.

James took a mouthful of Cullough without preparing himself.

James, you've been a good friend while I'm here, helping me ease into the
 situation.
 We're like-minded, you are a damned good professional if I've ever seen
 one, but why are you doing this for me? It can't be that you're risking
 so much at such a time just to help a white man from Scotland.
 I do consider you an honest comrade, a friend I wish I can drool with over
 a bottle of scotch when I'm hopefully old enough to pee on my pants.
 But tell me, why exactly are you doing this? If it's about money, I assure
 you I ..

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I've never felt more insulted in my life.
 You have a knack, all the Englishmen it seems.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

You want to know why I want to help you with whatever means at my disposal?
 It's because I consider you a friend as well.
 Mostly though because I too, had a brother once.
 A brother who helped me grow into the man I am today, who buried our dead
 mother with his own hands, and who carried our father on his back for miles
 every time he needed to see a doctor.
 I lost that brother.
 I lost Enkele.
 I lost him and while I could have done something about it, I simply watched
 him go away, never to return.
 So, I've been in your place Ethan.
 I know you're doing what I should have done years ago.
 And I want you to find your brother.
 That, I swear unto God.

The British embassy in Lagos was the typical colonial building of the Africas,
 resplendent and austere, an indubitable legacy of the Empire.
 Its tall thick windows shone with the brightness of the noon sun when Ethan
 walked through the front gate saluting the guard on duty only perfunctorily.
 He eased down the main corridor, and without even answering a couple of
 greetings from Embassy staff, he dived straight into the intelligence office
 on the 2nd floor.
 He knocked briskly on the open door labeled Cultural Affairs, and entered
 without pausing for an answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There he found a man in his late fifties, short and miniscule, who sported
 a thick mustache, an almost completely bald scalp and a pair of old-fashioned
 ebony-rimmed glasses.
 The label on his desk read `Isidor Bloom - Director of Cultural Affairs'.
 He immediately popped a smile and addressed Ethan like a good friend or
 a close acquaintance.
 Even though they had only occassionally met at a couple of Embassy dinners,
 he offered his hand in a lively, warm way and said:

How do you do? Jolly good I hope, old friend.

As suddenly as before, Mr.

 self.
 Wearing an almost disconcertingly wide grin on his face, he picked up the
 phone on his desk, dialed a single number, and said:

 Mr.

 Then, Mr.

Fucking cunt can sod off.
 Now, let's clear a few things: This friend of yours, Ruthers, can sod off

 I don't give fuckall about the why or how, I'm going home to Cheltenham

With that last weird and almost unintelligible remark, Mr.

 and strolled out of his office, carefull to smoothly close the door behind
 him.

Ethan stood frozen in his chair, unable to fathom what exactly had transpired.
 The only certainty was that Mr.

 Ethan's thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing.
 Thinking it should be Ruthers on the other end of the phone, Ethan picked
 up the phone:

James rolled a cigarette.
 Real tobacco, confiscated from customs.
 A smile, a joke and a tap in the back will go a long way.

 A piece of wisdom from Britain's finest.

He lit his cigarette and sat down on a chair across the kitchen table.
 Some fish lay half-eaten, its maws showing a slightly serrated set of tiny
 teeth.
 The smell of roast dominated the room and an open window showed the grill
 on the small porch, a few coals settling down, their heat meaningless in
 the summer night of Lagos.

A wedding feast was being held in the next street, the gathered crowd like

The burning tip of the cigarette fell on James' arm, and it shook instinctively,
 ash marking the spot of the slight burn.
