\begin_layout Chapter
The Storm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A soft brown glow outlined the Wall, its sheer size dominating the horizon.
 Sigmund was holding on to his spear, surveying the landscape with a pair
 of digital enhanced binoculars, one of the last few still working.
 Upstream he could discern Lake Spagelow dry this time of year, again too
 soon for comfort.
 Still no sign of Jared and Ernst though, he thought to himself.
 He turned around to look at his eba, scrounging for food around the low
 bush, with little luck that day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I told you the bush here is thin, the bedrock too hard for burrowers.
 Still you had to try, no?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, Sigmund said forcing a smile, and the eba answered without pausing his
 search:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes friend.
 I have to try.
 Every day.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I suppose we all do.
 At least on Eden you have to.
 Come, let's get back to the buggy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund started to walk away when the eba said in a gravely, steady and
 demanding tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We wait for Jared and Ernst.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund rolled his eyes and sighed before turning to look at the eba with
 a patient, well-practiced manner that demanded most of his self-control.
 He spoke as if addressing a small child:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The storm is going to hit us on the plains if we wait any longer.
 Let's go eba, and don't worry about Jared and Ernst.
 They're used to this sort of work.
 You could say they almost like doing it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You don't, friend?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the eba asked slightly tilting its head showing genuine surprise and interest.
 Its whiskers twitched involuntarily and Sigmund answered in a hurried tone:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I would, if the job didn't try to kill me all the time.
 Now, come.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I fear for them, our friends.
 Please, let's stay.
 Please, friend Sigmund,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the eba's voice a pleading barytone, almost inappropriately petulant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They can find shelter in one of the old pumping stations if they're not
 that thick in the head.
 Now, I'm even asking you nicely: please, get in the buggy.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund was having second thoughts about leaving them alone, but he insisted
 on his original train of thought.
 He didn't want to die, not today, not in a sandstorm on Eden, not looking
 for two light-headed naborns.
 He couldn't help repeating in his mind, 'What where they thinking anyway?'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba, as if exhibiting a rare moment of telepathic skill or simply sticking
 to its guns made a small step, its eyes searching for Sigmund's own under
 his goggles.
 Its voice seemed uncannily human in its emotion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Let us look for them then.
 They may be hurt, may need help,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the eba said while pawing invisible foes in the air, making a show of what
 it meant, as if Sigmund was deaf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund rested his goggles on his forehead, and took another survey of the
 area.
 Today's storm would hit stronger than yesterday, it seemed to him; it was
 past mid-month and all the signs where there.
 Every kind of what little life existed on Eden was already sensing the
 change in pressure, digging deep and staying covered.
 Even the glow above the Wall was darker than usual.
 A killer storm for certain.
 After all those years, he didn't need a satellite image to tell him that.
 He shook his head in disbelief of what he was about to say, let alone do,
 but he managed to say to the eba:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You are a real pain, do you know that eba? One of these days you're going
 to make me regret I took you in.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Maybe friend.
 But now is more important than one day.
 Let us look for Jared, Ernst.", said the large cat, raising its tail suddenly
 upright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Only as far as upstream to the lake.
 Then we have to turn back, or we run out of power.
 Understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sigmund said pointing to Lake Spagelow, so that he made it clear this was
 as far as he'd go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, friend.
 No wasting more time.
 Go now.
 Find them!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund started off with a brisk pace down the trail to the buggy, using
 his spear for support down the grainy sand and rock of the Lookout Hill.
 The eba was faster, its paws churning whiffs of grey-red dirt as it raced
 downhill to get to the buggy first, each time an unofficial race going
 on.
 As Sigmund was coming down the hill he muttered to himself:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm going to die because of a talking cat.
 Talking cat on the first exoplanetary colony.
 Another first.
 Sigmund Tannhauser, extraplanetary idiot, extraordinaire.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba was already crouched inside the buggy, its head darting left and
 right for signs of activity, whether it be danger or friends, doing his
 earthly ancestor predators justice.
 Sigmund fastened his spear on some ingeniously designed side latches and
 jumped inside the buggy as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund took a last, quick look behind him and nodded to himself:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eden.
 Right.
 What was I thinking.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He pushed the start button on the buggy, and the control panel lit up instantly,
 motors and servos whirring while the startup diagnostic ran.
 A few seconds later, they were heading upstream to the lake, at a quick
 pace.
 Riding along the dried up river bed of Musk River the buggy's motor whir
 blended with the sound of metal speeding over chipped pebbles and gravel.
 The buggy and the loose surface were perfectly paired, but plainly comfort
 had not been a design goal.
 It was impossible to compensate for the feeling of sailing over what felt
 like thick rock mud, the buggy frame tilting and swaying but always keeping
 the heading in the intended direction.
 The eba seemed to lack its earlier enthusiasm over what seemed to be its
 own, self-appointed mission.
 Sigmund gazed around the broken landscape for signs of Jared and Ernst
 with no success.
 He took note of the eba's apparent discomfort and asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How are you feeling, eba?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sick,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the curt response and irritated tone meant 'sick' was a literal term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, not again, please try to get to the sides before you..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund's appeal was cut short when the eba could not stand the upheaval
 for much longer before vomiting on the back of the buggy.
 Its facial hair had become soiled and ragged-looking, its look was dreary
 and in no way did it resemble the predator its genetic stock had originated
 from.
 Sigmund started shouting with a modest hint of disgust in his voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not inside!The batteries are meant to..Not inside the bugg, ever! This was
 not designed to come in contact with liquids..
 You will clean it up.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund held his finger in the air as if lecturing a bothersome child, his
 tone firm but not angry.
 Perhaps agitated, and from the look on his face, rightly so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I will clean it up, friend.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, said the eba feeling a little better and managing a thin smile, vomit
 still wet on its face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why are you smiling? The storm is about to hit, we haven't found a single
 sign of the naborns and you just barfed.
 Don't get coy with me.
 Clean up your face, stop smiling.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A smile cannot make things worse,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the eba answered in a resolute voice, as if reciting religious dogma, or
 a corporate slogan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the buggy raced with its motors near maximum capacity, Sigmund stabbed
 the eba with an accusing look:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Have you been talking with Chen? Because that sounds like something Chen
 would say.
 Chen's an optimistic fool.
 Remember, fools are much more likely to end up dead.
 Or on Eden.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Strange that you should say that.
 He also says that you are the fool.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba blinked in surprise and bewilderment at what seemed to it to be
 a show of magnificent powers of deduction at work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Does he? Well, just shut up and keep looking.
 Remember though, whatever else happens, you are still cleaning that up,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said Sigmund and took another look through his binoculars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There friend! To our right!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba straightened its back suddenly, poised as if to strike, its whole
 body a compass indicator leaning on a definite direction.
 Sigmund turned his head and zoomed with the binoculars, the built-in pattern
 recognition trying to identify Jared and Ernst or somekind of human built
 tracks.
 He brought the buggy to an abrupt stop and scanned to their right again,
 this time with more diligence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can see them.
 I'll run ahead friend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 said the eba and casually leaped off the buggy and ran.
 It ate away at the landscape, leaving a brown and silver cloud behind it.
 Sigmund was stunned to silence and paused his search momentarily, taking
 in the sight of the eba speeding towards the Wall.
 The storm was still gathering on their back, on a desert planet twenty
 light years away from Earth, a sky the color of viridian with hues of blue
 and black.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even after all these years, in times like these, Sigmund realised the awe
 that manifested around him and shivered.
 He took a deep breath and put the binoculars back on, now tracking the
 eba as well as two other figures too far away to positively identify them.
 Noone else was due out this far upstream today, none that he knew of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could safely conclude that it was either them or someone equally stupid,
 which would be no small surprise as of late with every number dwindling
 except for the amount of idiots running free.
 Sigmund kicked in the 'sediment' mode on the buggy, and its metal wheels
 - a memory metal - reshaped itself in a thin-faceted, gear-like, Eden-proven
 design.
 A few indicators lit up and the screen showed energy estimates.
 Gobbling down more power than the solar panels could provide, the battery
 would be exhausted before they reached Landing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund snarled something in German and pressed on with the buggy, following
 eba towards the two figures, hoping the emergency fuel cell would be enough.
 He said to noone in particular, for no particular reason:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Called me a fool did he? Chen, you are a dick.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Sigmund and the eba approached the two young men it seemed they were
 indeed in need of help.
 The eba arrived first and was standing guard, looking out for whatever
 danger might still lurk around.
 The boys seemed in one piece.
 Jared, a thin lad with wiry hair, had met a sand-ant up and close and it
 looked like it wasn't much fun at all.
 He had several cuts and scrapes all over him.
 Possibly a torn calf muscle as well.
 He was limping on his left leg, putting his weight on Ernst both trudging
 along westward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund slid to a stop nearby, and started walking towards the two boys,
 spear in hand, aggravation written across his face.
 He could not help himself chastising the two young men:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

So you went too far upstram searching for water.
 And you thought you'd become heroes or something.
 Used up the buggy's power still miles away from Landing and you went on
 foot.
 And got jumped by a sand ant.
 Feel proud for yourselves?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jared, the wounded one, immediately retorted, his tanned face looking smoothly
 impervious to any sort of guilt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You know we need the water and it was a small pack, three of them; we killed
 them all.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ernst was sheepishly taking a look at the verbal confrontation, while packing
 their gear on their buggy.
 Sigmund went silent for a few moments, staring at the two boys with an
 uncertain look between anger and worry.
 At length, he pointed an accusing finger at Jared, trying to maintain an
 even though strict tone of voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You're naborns and maybe you think you have adjusted better than the rest
 of us, but dying never helped anyone, did it? Killing three sand ants just
 messed you up so you won't be able to work again for at least a couple
 of weeks, and another buggy is lost somewhere out there and someone will
 have to go get it tomorrow, if it survives the storm! And all this to satisfy
 your adolescent craving for pack superiority.
 Very much so like animals! As if growing hair meant you've grown brains!
 Did you ever pause to think?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comment about the animals spurred some heavy eyebrow movement and piercing
 eye shots from the eba towards Sigmund, but once he shot back an even glance,
 it quickly retrained its attention towards safeguarding the rest of them
 until they loaded up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

And what would you have us do, Teacher? Wait around till one of you provides
 a miracle? Until Eden decides to turn upside down for our own sake? You
 know we need water more than ever, so stop excusing yourself.
 Coward.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vehemence of Jared's last word was such that it struck everyone with
 numbness and amazement.
 Everyone except Sigmund who inspite of himself dropped what he was carrying
 to stand still in front of Jared for just a moment, nostrils covered with
 dirt flaring up.
 Jared sat still but calm, and then his mouth turned into a slight, almost
 childish grin.
 Sigmund slapped him in the face, making Ernst and the eba freeze where
 they stood.
 Jared was dumbfounded; Sigmund had a reputation for being mild-mannered
 and strictly against any form of violence.
 While he was trying to come up with a defying insult, Sigmund kept him
 at pause saying in a calm but determined manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I spent one hundred and twenty years in cryogenic storage.
 A hundred and twenty years of still life and REM brain function.
 I almost went half-mad getting here for the so-called betterment of mankind,
 and all I got was a fucking desert planet trying to kill me and teenagers
 who think this is fun! While I'm risking my neck looking out for you dimwits
 with a death wish, there's a sandstorm coming that can eat your flesh to
 the bone, and you have the audacity to call me a coward.
 How I wish I really was one and never stepped foot in here in the first
 place.
 Stayed back on Earth, do a round trip to the Jupiter belt and write a book.
 But I wanted the full ride, so here I am.
 And here you are, as well.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment of stillness ensued, their gaze interlocking and reapproving one
 another.
 Jared measured Sigmund's stare and tone.
 He seemed to accept his place, at least for now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here we are indeed, Teacher.
 What of it now?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ernst picked up the last of their gear and equipment and fastened it to
 the buggy, which was now looking like a metallic pack mule, minus the rustic
 charm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund sat in the driver's seat and started the buggy's motor, checking
 power gauges and estimations, selecting Landing's position on the map and
 at the same time answeering Jared:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just shut up and get in the buggy.
 Maybe the storm will get close enough for you to show it some more respect
 the next time you decide to become a hero.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jared decided to be silent for now, postponing a further comment.
 With the help of Ernst he made his way to the buggy and sat quite uncomfortably
 among the heap of gear, his face contorting in pain.
 Ernst hadn't spoken a word but felt relieved to be sitting again with no
 claws at his back trying to rip him apart, and he closed his eyes and seemed
 to pray.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sigmund took notice of that action, peculiar especially for a naborn, and
 decided to further enquire Ernst about it.
 For the moment, they had to leave then and there.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eba took a last glancing look daywards into the direction of the storm
 and gracefully leapt in the buggy next to Sigmund, managing to curl up
 and fit nicely in a space designed for a human buttock.
 Momentarily, Sigmund hit the emergency power and the buggy lurched with
 sudden acceleration far greater than normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dirt,gravel, and rock were being spewn back from the buggy's wheels which
 covered ground with astonishing speed.
 Sigmund glanced around to his back and saw the storm front finally appear.
 The closer they got to Landing the darker the sky and cooler the atmosphere.
 The air was thick with sand, dust and the approaching overpressure of the
 daily sandstorm.
 Sigmund connected with Landing's cavemaster and asked for an open gate.

The brief chatter was enough for everyone involved to realise that if they
 really couldn't get inside on time, they would really be on their own.
 Which meant death in every recorded instance up to now.
 It made sense if you had nowhere else to hide from a three hundred mile-per-hou
