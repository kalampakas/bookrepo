	The sound of small, shuffling feet roused Penthesileia from an
	uneasy, troubled sleep. She rolled to the other side of her bed and
	slowly opened her eyes; she saw Heraclea standing by the bedside in
	the dim blueish light of the glowstrips. The child’s face was pale
	white and taut with fright. Her mouth was half-open, as if her
	scream had been sucked into the silent void. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Hush now, child. Hush and worry not. I’m here now,” whispered
	Penthesileia in her daughter’s ear, her arms wrapped around the
	little girl like a warm coccoon. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She felt Heraclea’s shallow breath and her fragile body’s
	tremors; chills ran down her spine.

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Where is father? I want to see him,” said Heraclea stifling a
	sob, barely able to contain a rush of tears. She rubbed a runny nose
	against her mother’s chest and looked at her with heart-melting
	innocence. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“He’s in orbit my love, you know that already. Come, lay beside
	me and nothing will hurt you, I promise,” said Penthesileia but
	her eyes grew distant suddenly. She stared at a pot plant behind her
	daughter’s back. It had large drooped leaves and creamy rose buds;
	it served no purpose other than beautification. It was contraband. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	A thought entered her mind unbidden: <I>He could be frozen stiff,

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Your father loves you more than anything,” said Penthesileia
	and swallowed hard. She added hastily, and even tried to smile
	reassuringly: 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“He’s coming soon, Hera.”

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She heard her falsetto voice through her own ears; the lie pierced
	her soul like a blade made of glass, shattering inside. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She closed her eyes and grabbed Heraclea from her shoulders, as if
	trying to fix her to the floor:

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Your father and I love you more than the stars in the night sky;

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	What is life worth anyway on this forsaken rock, she thought and
	kissed her daughter’s forehead, feeling the cold taste of dried
	sweat. The child looked at her expectantly, fear creasing her brow: 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“I love you too mother. But I’m scared.” 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“That’s alright, Hera. Everyone’s scared. We’re only human,”
	said Penthesileia with a slight sigh and looked outside their small
	window pane; the moons were fading away, while a trio of suns came
	rising spectacularly, the horizon an unearthly rainbow of
	golden-hued colors. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“What do you mean, mother?” asked Heraclea puzzled, the fear
	subsiding.

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Nothing love. Come here now. Lay on the bed, close your eyes and

	<I>Think of merrier times, </I>she thought and shuddered. <I>For the

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“And father at the helm?” asked the little girl as she climbed
	eagerly on the bed, a carefree smile sheepishly forming on her
	mouth. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Always, my love,” said Penthesileia. She clutched her daughter
	in her arms like a hawk-mother and felt a tear ran down her cheek. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She looked through her window at the rich, crystal clear horizon.
	The break of dawn was at hand; she saw the Hyperion shining
	brightly, moving slowly across the sky like a star with purpose. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>How can a star be so unforgiving?</I>

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She felt Heraclea’s nudge; the child inched closer to her bosom.
	In moments, she felt her breathing settle into the easy pace of
	sleep.

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>How can my child live in this world?</I>

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Penthesileia carefully moved away from her daughter and slid out of
	bed. She planted her naked feet on the floor and felt the warmth of
	the ground radiate into her legs. She used to love that warm feeling
	of connection with the earth. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Only this isn’t Earth</I>, she reminded herself thoughtfully.

	They had come for Philetus while they were fixing the sail. He had
	promised Hera to take her on another ride out on the Fields. ‘To
	learn to see beauty where there seems to be none,’ he had said
	with a gentle smile. They had all the sigils stamped on the codas;
	they recited a long, hurtful list of accusations: inciting rumours,
	rousing suspicion in the hearts of the citizens, demagoguery,
	abusing the State’s charter, spreading lies. ‘The Pedagogue who
	turned Demagogue’, on of them had said with sickening, mocking
	pride. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	She walked towards the window and watched the Hyperion fly past the
	horizon, towards the east. She stared at the ship that shone like a
	star passing over the Tower, its multitude of beacon lights,
	superstructures and metal support grid marring its otherwise perfect
	symmetry and features. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The tower rose majestically towards the morning sky, a sleek
	obsidian arrowhead the size of a mountain, tall enough to scrape the
	few daring clouds. It reflected light with a sharp glint, as well as
	every other kind of energy and radiation; immaculate, mysterious,
	alien in origin.

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	Philetus had told her it reminded him of a tall, grandiose building
	back on Earth; a tower where people flocked to simply enjoy the
	view. ‘It might as well have been just that,’ he had said and
	kissed her when she least expected him to. She touched her cheek out
	of instinct, waiting vainly for a warm, gentle hand to embrace her
	own. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	‘To be never seen again,’ she said with a whisper, just like
	Philetus had told her first. The painful memory froze her face in a

	The guard, a burly, grey-haired man, chuckled and drew his chair
	closer to the small holding cell. He was wearing simple grey
	overalls, a utilitarian garment. No badge of office, no insignia or
	any other kind of decoration. He peered at their surroundings
	momentarily, as if he was standing there for the first time. He
	spared a few glances at the ever-pervasive optical sensors arranged
	throughout the cell block; as if making sure someone was watching
	him.

	The clinical white, cold finishing on every surface failed to bring

	The guard looked at Philetus inquisitively before cocking his head
	sideways, as if trying to peer past some sort of mask. The bright
	crimson prisoner’s uniform that Philetus wore stood out
	impressively, though it was otherwise equally mundane as the guard’s
	suit. It wasn’t the suit that gotten the guard’s attention.

	The guard did not shy away from showing his contempt. He stared at

	Philetus stared back evenly, before asking the guard in earnest:

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Since I pose no danger to you, would you listen to what I have to

	“I’ve heard madmen and heretics muse about the end of days and

	crazy it brings a smile to my face. But as you can see, it is an
	otherwise unfulfilling job,” he said with a sigh, showing the
	blank, featureless walls in a somewhat demure way. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The guard shrugged, nodded and sat back on his desk’s hovering
	chair. From across the hallway, a man in a holding cell cried out

	“Right next to the miners you spaced, I’m sure. Save it,

	other sound came from Barabba’s cell. He yelled and shouted and
	threw himself around the cell until he realised it was a futile
	effort; no-one paid him any attention. He sat himself down once more
	and went about muttering to himself.

	“Not yet, but it’s a clear cut case. He can’t be slaved, he’s

	The Head of the Guards appeared, fiddled with the panel on his desk
	and lowered the barrier of Philetus’ cell. He was wearing a
	seemingly lightweight powered suit of armor of some sort. It made
	him look austere and unyielding; the oblique visor added to that
	effect. Without the visor, anyone would have seen nothing but a
	confused, puzzled man wearing an ill-fitting suit. He held a metal
	rod in one hand; an intense electric field around its tip made it
	hum quietly.

	Philetus shook his head and rose from his simple metal cot. His
	hands were uncomfortably held together by heavy metal manacles,
	locked in place by large bars and bolts, impossible to escape by a
	mere sleight of hand. Philetus walked outside under the watchful eye
	of the guard, while Barabbas screamed and shouted mute obscenities
	behind his sound-nullified cell.

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The guard afforded him a mere warning finger accompanied by a heavy
	stare; he turned around and led Philetus towards the exit. A panel
	by the door blurted in a synthesized male voice, blatantly devoid of
	emotion:

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The guard placed a palm on the surface of the panel while staring at
	an optical sensor through an open visor. Moments later, the panel
	blurted with the ting of metal in its voice:

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	The door opened nearly without a sound, revealing a utilitarian,
	spartan corridor only a few feet wide. Non-descript illuminated
	panels of white plastic formed the walls; the end of the corridor
	was obscured in total darkness. Philetus turned to Sustar and said
	with a keen, wholly unnerving smile: 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">

	“It does not suit you at all, Saul. But then again, perhaps it

	a pointed finger and said irately:

	Philetus nodded serenely and said nothing. He stepped onto the
	corridor followed by Sustar right behind him. The floor was made out
	of the same plastic as the walls. Its surface was rigid, yet
	unblemished. Every step of the way, Philetus felt his feet stick to
	the floor; it somehow felt like it was impossible for someone to

	They reached a recess, an open archway that led into a shaft of
	sorts. It was kept in the dark, but the faint trace of a simple

	shot a few glances around him as if making sure this was the right

	Philetus glanced at Sustar and saw nothing behind his black oblique

	behind him, urging him to move. He took a few hesitant steps,
	failing to see where he should put his hands and legs. Suddenly the
	darkness dissolved. Philetus turned his head to look down and was
	almost blinded; Sustar had turned on his helmet’s lights. He
	merely motioned ‘up’ with a finger. Philetus looked upwards and

	The climb was easy; in a couple of minutes the pinprick of light had
	turned into a warm, soft glow in front of him. He felt as light as a
	feather. He pushed himself off the ladder with his manacled hands

	cold breath trailing behind him.

	Philetus was suddenly bathed in a warm reddish light, its hue
	oscillating lazily. An enormous, empty cylindrical space unfolded
	around him with a network of antennae, cables and pipes lining its
	walls; they resembled a fabulously engineered, metallic skin,
	pleasingly bronzed; the colour of copper was prevalent. At both ends
	of the cylinder, giant blueish cubes could be seen, stacked on top
	of each other, emanating swaths of iridescent light. The whole empty
	chamber rotated around him at a comfortable speed. Thin strands of
	light danced about him, as if hugging him with care.

	couldn’t see any settlements he’d been before; he couldn’t see
	any settlements at all for that matter. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He searched for the Pydna mines in the distance. The lengthy line of
	hills wasn’t there. He noticed that all around the Fields, it was
	as if a sort of thin hazy fog had come down. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Just how far dawnwards am I?</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The wind was strong but steady; he was making good speed. He set the
	sail trim and sat down for a moment to enjoy the view. That was why
	he took the sail out on such trips; the few things he could enjoy in
	life was groundsailing and his family. Strangely enough though, the
	vista seemed peculiar; it was oddly devoid of life, of other sails
	and settlements. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	That and a few other things made him uneasy. He noticed the grassy
	stalks had an even, uncannily perfect look. And the star seemed to
	take forever to set. It was like daytime had grown longer suddenly.
	And the wind above all, the wind felt too kind; instead of changing
	like it was prone to in the Fields, buffeting and stalling at a
	whim, it blew steadily, as if the sail had caught on a one-of-a-kind
	stream. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Small matter; with any luck I’ll be home by nightfall.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Then, from the corner of his eye he saw a couple of shadowy shapes
	outlined in the distance. He looked at them with curious intent,
	only to realise they were edging closer. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	At first, it seemed to Philetus like he’d happened upon some
	larger sails, hurrying to reach their haven before night, just like
	himself. But then he noticed the shadows growing larger and larger
	with every passing moment. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The large shapes pierced the haze and he could see them much more
	clearly defined; they were large, bulky and . Something ticked
	inside of him; he felt wary for no apparent reason. He jibbed the
	sail again and caught the wind broad, skimming above the grass
	faster than before. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He took notice of their sails; three huge masts on a square-rigged
	groundship, its sheer bulk impossible to take in at first glance. He
	could see wide metal heads plowing through the wheat effortlessly.
	They were immense; he had never seen anything like them before. He
	couldn’t even believe it was possible to build such monsters, much
	less groundsail them. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Windcombs.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He didn’t know what to make of them except for the fact that for
	some reason, they seemed to be getting closer and closer; they would
	not be going their separate ways. It was as if they were chasing
	him. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He looked on with dread as he saw them sail onwards, chugging huge
	tracts of wheat in moments. They were voracious metal behemoths,
	something that nature had never dared spawn. They were speeding
	impossibly fast, closing in with the sure, calculated steps of a
	predator. Like birds of prey right before a lethal, final swoop. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Maybe they haven’t seen me.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He opened a box compartment and pulled out a flare gun;
	illumination, thermal, radio. He shot one in the air. It went white
	hot in the flick of an eye, a bright yellow flashing beacon alight
	in its tip. As it arched behind him, he saw the windcombs gaining
	even more ground. He shot another flare and then another one. They
	weren’t slowing down; they weren’t changing course. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He knew they had seen him; it was impossible not to by now. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>They want to kill me.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Slipstreaming right above the sea of grass they were now close
	enough for him to see their riveted joints and their hull plates,
	the huge wires on their booms and masts. He could hear the whirring
	noise of their blades growing stronger, their sound even more
	threatening as it reverberated through their girded cage. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>I’ll be damned. They’ll kill me for sure.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He looked behind him and saw the windcombs a few hundred yards
	apart, blotting out the rays of the star that held on to dusk like a
	man hanging over a cliff from the root of a saggy tree. He couldn’t
	outrun them, not with that steady powerful wind; that much was
	certain. As the windcombs started to close the gap behind them,
	converging on his tiny sail, he thought of Penthesileia. She was
	always worried sick for no reason when he went sailing. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>There’s reason enough now.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He jibbed the boom violently; the small groundship lurched around
	almost tipping over and spilling him onto the ground right in the
	path of the blades. As it did so, he steadied the ship right against
	the flow of the wind, in irons. Instead of slowing down to a halt,
	the groundship went on and sped ahead, an undercurrent of wind
	lofting it above the grass and buffeting its sail from behind. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Philetus aimed his sail straight in the space between the two huge
	windcombs. The blades seemed like they would miss it for a few
	yards. He then saw the sails on the windcombs change their line
	ferociously, as if someone had thrown a switch, trembling as the
	blasts of the wind caught on to them. The windcombs’ enormous
	hulls tried to cope with the sudden strain; they turned about in
	anguish, their bulks careening like wild elephants of old. Still,
	they missed Philetus’s ship. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	But they met each other; their blades clashed into each other’s
	prow, eating away at themselves and the ships, sparks flying wildly.
	They ground at each other with logic-defying stubborness, as if
	somehow they could part away from their last embrace. Instead, their
	blades soon died down after having turned both windcombs into a
	drifting, horrible hulk of mangled metal. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Philetus breathed deeply and allowed himself a moment to calm down.
	He sat down on the deck, watching the skyline turn a shade darker.
	The hazy fog lifted suddenly; he could now see the Tower in the
	distance. It was strange how close to home everything had
	transpired; if it wasn’t for the fog someone might have already
	seen what happened. The thought made him frown pensively. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>The machines. The machines want me dead. They know.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Perspiration formed on his head. He was really worried now; because
	if the machines knew what he had in mind for them and their
	benevolent planning for mankind, that meant they knew about
	Heraclea. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He felt the wind change; he jibbed the sail immediately and came
	abeam. He knew of no better way to reach home as fast as possible. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>I must make it in time. If they so much as touch her..</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He’d claw his way into the Tower if he had to. He’d stop at
	nothing, that much was certain in his mind. They would probably kill
	him easily, but living on would be pointless without Hera in any
	case. Without her smile, her kisses and her laughter. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>I’ll kill myself if they don’t first. But please, let her be

	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He saw then from afar the line of birches he’d planted himself;
	right next to them, the small orchard, the trees laden with fruit.
	The small-domed house with the aetrium and the flower garden; that
	was home. Out there, outside the city proper they had enjoyed peace,
	quiet and solitude. Heraclea was born in that house. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He skimmed the last few meters and tacked hard against the wind
	suddenly. The sail rocked, bobbed and turned before he pressed the
	panel and shut down the antigravity field. The sail came down hard
	on the ground and skidded for a few moments, throwing up billows of
	dirt in its wake. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Before it had come to a stop, Philetus was already dashing to the
	door. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>It will be alright. They’ll be fine. They’re fine.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He saw Penthesileia then. She was standing outside, looking at the
	star set with a vacant stare, her form stuck as if waiting for
	someone. She saw Philetus then and turned to him; she took no step
	closer. She waited, her hands clasped together solemnly. Her face
	was pale, her mouth half-open as if she had no words for what she
	meant to say. Philetus saw her and somehow knew. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>No. No. It’s not true.</I> 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He stood in front of her, his face reddened, flush from the anguish
	and the exertion. He told her out of breath: 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Where is Hera?” 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Penthesileia shook her head without saying a word. She looked at him
	morosely, her stare a deathly gaze, sombre and foreboding. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“No.” 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She broke down in tears suddenly and threw her body against his, her
	knees weak. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“They came. They knew,” she managed to croak amidst sobs and

	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“She’s in the Tower then,” said Philetus, shooting the
	imposing tower behind him a desperate look. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Philetus, there’s no hope. We need to leave while we still
	can.” 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Her words stung him like an electric shock. He stared at her with
	the eyes of a blind man seeing the light of day for the first time
	in his life. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Leave?” 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	It sounded as if he had never heard the word before, his mouth
	contorting as he spoke the word. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Penthesileia took his hands in hers affectionately, craned her neck
	and looked at him lovingly. A film of tears in her eyes reflected
	the first rays of starlight as the night settled in. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“There’s just us now, Philetus. We can always try again,

	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Leave her? Leave Heraclea to them? Are you insane?” shouted
	Philetus flinging her arms away from his violently. Anger overtook
	him. She took a hesitant step back. Her brow was furrowed, her face
	drawn out, taut. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“It was your fault, not mine,” she said bitterly.

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Philetus was stunned for a moment; he opened his mouth, tried to
	retort but couldn’t find the words. Penthesileia went on. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“It was your fault from the beginning. Your wild ideas, your
	strange beliefs. Why couldn’t we have a normal life? Why did we
	have to be outcasts? Did I have to give birth to an unlawful child
	only to lose her a few years later? What kind of sacrifice did you
	ask of me, Philetus?” 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	His eyes stared at her vacantly for a moment. He tried to think
	clearly but he felt his blood boiling, his heart pumping wildly. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“I asked of you to love me. Me and our child. I’d let them slave

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“What use would that have been? Don’t be stupid, Philetus! She’s

	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“My daughter is in that Tower, damn you!” he said, and strolled
	off back towards his sail. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“Where are you going?”

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“I can’t believe you’re asking me that question,” replied
	Philetus without stopping, his back rigidly facing Penthesileia. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Father</I>, he heard a voice in his mind. He recognised it; it

	stride 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“No, you will not,” said Penthesileia and unfolded a small gun

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>Father, watch out!</I>

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The voice urged him; it was as if a divine breath of wind had
	whispered in his ear. He knew his daughter was alive then; his body
	moved almost of its own accord and the first shot missed him only
	barely. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He then ducked as if the sail’s boom was going to hit him in the
	head; the second shot missed his head by a few inches. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	And then he dived towards Penthesileia with all his might. He could
	see her face frozen in disbelief and worry; he couldn’t see his
	own, the flustered face of a maniac baring his teeth with an angry
	scream like a howl. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Philetus dropped her on the ground and another shot went flying
	wildly into the air. He fell on top of her, placing his weight
	against his. It was a familiar face on that woman, and a familiar
	scene to Philetus; but this wasn’t about lovemaking. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He bit her arm hard, his teeth sinking in her flesh with some
	effort. She screamed and the gun left her hand. She tried to force
	him off her, but simply couldn’t. Philetus saw her face closely
	then, he saw the malevolence that tormented it. He saw her anger,
	her hate. He knew for certain then; nothing remained of his wife in
	that woman. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	She spat him in the face and her mouth twitched into an impossibly
	wide grin. Philetus placed his hands around her throat with
	sympathy, as if doing her a favor. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“You just had to have it your way,” she said with derision. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He blinked, nodded and pressed hard. Her breathing became a shallow
	whisper soon. She fought reflexively, trying to take his hands off
	her throat, but it was futile. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	Philetus pressed on with all his mightl; he felt her windpipe
	crumble. He saw her eyes roll back; nothing but the white in them.
	She twitched slightly and a mute roar left her. She was dead. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	<I>I killed her. I killed Penthesileia.</I>

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	“I know love. I fear it wouldn’t make a difference,” said

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	The house then dissolved in rainbow-coloured flashing blocks that
	quickly dissappeared, leaving nothing but a black void in their
	place. The same thing happened to everything around him, the effect
	spreading like wildfire. The ground, the sky, the horizon;
	everything around him flashed into oblivion; the Tower was the last
	one to go. 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	A moment of nothingness ensued. He felt a moment of panic; he had to

	He felt the opening of his eyes, but saw abrupt blackness. In a

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He threw himself upwards, as if trying to leap into flight without a

	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.1in; border: none; padding: 0in">
	He glanced around, blinking his eyes wildly; his vision soon
	adjusted to the dim ambient light of indicator panel arrays, front
	and behind. There were naked people all around him, lying down on
	their backs in a bed much like his own, seemingly sleeping
	comfortably. People of all ages and gender, carefully arrayed,
	almost crammed together. Cables ran down from the beds and
	disappeared in a snake-like fashion into crevices and shafts built
	along the floor.

	He felt a trickle running down his backside; he put a hand there and
	felt something warm. He saw blood smeared in his hand; he looked at
	the bed were he was lying. There was a series of thin spikes that

	of her body, leading into a mass of delicately woven wires, cables
	and fibres. They were connected by a myriad of ways with two

	cope with it all, and gave up. All the screens became garbled with
	static before they turned white and black again. A simple “REST
	NOW” in huge flashing letters began to endlessly scroll down on
	every screen. Beyond the screens, through the slim viewport, one
	could see the Hyperion was already falling through the atmosphere,
	whole miles of metal burning up beyond their limits; a bright, shiny
