Flammability, Incorporeal Creatures and the Parking Lot of Eternity

\begin_layout Standard
John was the best I'd ever seen with a blowtorch.
 He wielded it like Da Vinci wielded a god-damn paintbrush.
 He could do things with it that in many places were certainly illegal and
 definitely deranged, with the possible exception of Japan and/or Australia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was this thing about John and the blue-hot propane flames that bordered
 - nay, even surpassed - the realm of wonder.
 If Jesus could come down and visit from Heaven and work with a blowtorch
 next to John, he'd look like a pyromaniac hobo with a messiah complex and
 a background in carpentry, while John would just shine with a bright white
 light from within, turn water into beer and beer into piss with just a

 John was just

that

 good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it was a fucking bummer when I learned that his last words actually were:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Don't be a pussy, oxygen tanks do that hissing sound all the time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as classifying bummers goes, this was a triple-A class bummer, the
 kind of showstopper that had only been theorised up to John's untimely
 and gruesome death.
 The kind of bummer that could make Jim Carey's face flat and emotionless
 and Bill Clinton sworn to celibacy.
 It ranked way far above the A-plus bummer of being recently divorced, fired,
 being fired upon and being set on fire at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which was bad in and of itself, but not as bad as John getting blown up
 a day before the Job.
 That was a sad state of affairs that meant I was now a very sorry son of
 a bitch with a life expectancy that made the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

lifetime warranty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sound like a tasteless practical joke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here I was, melting away in a decrepit diner on route 72, at a swampy
 nowhere with some supposedly native american though actually gibberish
 name like 'Alatanoosa' or 'Whahananoka', someplace between Alabama and
 Tenessee.
 The coffee tasted like imported dirt, the kind of dirt you read about being
 very fashionable and exaggeratedly overpriced but at the end of the day,
 was just dirt.
 The fried eggs looked like fried eggs, but only in the most rudimentary
 way: there was an orange bit with some white plastic all around it.
 I guess my flair for adventure was wearing out so it just sat there, where
 I happily failed to ingest it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I really didn't feel like eating at all.
 Maybe it was the god-damn heat, the stale humid air and the fact that about
 the same time tomorrow, I would be probably looking at the wrong end of
 more than a couple of gun barrels because I had promised something I couldn't
 deliver to some very single-minded people with a propensity for shooting,
 rather than having coffee and biscuits and sympathizing with the bad card
 life dealt you.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason I couldn't deliver was I couldn't do the Job.
 And I couldn't do the Job without John, because John, the flamboyant blowtorch
 virtuoso with an unmatched record of ninety-two safes, safe-rooms, and
 bank vaults, an average time of three point three minutes, clean as a germ-obse
ssed placebo-munching single old lady right before kidney stone surgery
 and a no-smoking-on-the-job policy that kept my cigarette budget intact,
 had gone and killed himself in his brother's-in-law chop shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stopped and asked myself at that point whether that unfortunate death,
 at such a bad time, right before what would now prove to be the last gig
 in my career was a sign from God to stop doing what I did best: stealing.
 In a rare know-thyself moment I reminded myself I wasn't half as good at
 it as some Wall Street people, politicians and the let-me-lend-you-your-own-mon
ey cutthroats that roamed the street unabashed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logic would then imply that if there was going to be any smiting and all
 that holier-than-thou business, any God with a sense of perspective, morality
 and justice wouldn't start dishing it out on my end.
 And in any case, I decided that if God really had something to tell me,
 he'd better make a really really good point with lots of compelling arguments,
 like saving my ass pronto.
 Or at least point me to a direction, show me the road to salvation that
 preferably led somewhere warm and sandy in the Pacific, along with a couple
 of Cayman bank accounts, some instantly gratifying plastic surgery and
 twelve hundred different driving licenses.
 I'd have thought about asking for another favor but they said that size
 didn't matter, bank accounts' notwithstanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Realising how God and reality rarely intertwined, I felt some kind of emotional
 pressure the likes of which I hadn't experienced since high-school and
 all the awkward parties.
 A stress relief mechanism kicked in someplace inside me and I sighed deeply
 before shouting out an expletive, something eloquent like 'Fuck!'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That made some heads in the diner turn and raised the attached eyebrows
 apprehensively.
 It also gained me the attention of the establishment's chef- du-cuisine,
 a six-foot-three, two-hundred and fifty pound red-haired, bush-bearded
 wild-eyed man-like Alabama creature with a meat cleaver, a stained apron
 and a murderous gleam in his eye.
 He pointed that cleaver towards my direction and said with a slight snarl

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I nodded faintly and muttered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in an absent-minded fashion before I put ten bucks on the table, got up
 and left.
 He probably felt that'd given me a good old fashioned run-down, but I was
 simply in a hurry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at my watch, one of the few items I had actually bought with honest
 money from a winning lottery ticket back when I kept saying to myself that
 heists were 'a temporary thing'.
 It was half past ten in the morning, and I had more or less twenty two
 and a half hours to live.
 As I looked at the bland green and brown Southern scenery, I noticed a
 couple of dogs humping without a care in the world, oblivious to pretty
 much everything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to think something profound about nature and the will of life
 to survive and continue, when I noticed they both had 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stuff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dangling underneath.
 Even nature had a way of giving me the finger.
 I looked up into the blighting sun and all I could see was white and red
 dots for the next ten minutes.
 I'd left my glasses inside the diner.
 I said to myself, fuck that, I don't need sunglasses.
 I'm Bobby.
 I'm going to do what it takes, and I sure as hell can do it without sunglasses.
 In retrospect, that might have been a mistake cause those sunglasses had
 a history of their own, but it was time for action not remembrance.
 So I acted on impulse, without pausing to ruminate on the outcome of my
 actions, and especially what those actions might incur precipitate in relation
 to my person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, thinking back to that particular moment in time, the moment I decided
 to act was the moment I kept thinking to myself 'Bobby, that doesn't mean
 shit.
 John blowing up doesn't mean shit.
 You can still do this.
 You can still get rich, or die trying', that must have been the moment
 that would probably get the most votes in the 'Most Regrettable Moment
 in Your Entire Life' category.
 It would also get lots of points in the 'Shit I Wish I Hadn't Done' category,
 but the real winner in that one was calling up Eileen.
 I'd done mistakes before, but it always amazed me how impossibly fast I
 regretted calling Eileen on that particular day.
 I panicked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I rang her three times before she picked up.
 When she did, it sounded like she hadn't talked to a real person in about
 three years:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmbby? Mmmby Baahow? My Bobby Bear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took little notice that she had been stuffing herself, probably a bad
 case of munchies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, Eileen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 managing to keep my tone of voice even, normal.
 It really felt like biting the bullet when I said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's me, Papa-Bear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It also made me cringe as the connotations that old term of endearment
 implied flashed across my mind's eye.
 Jesus Christ, not Eileen.
 What was I doing? Was there no other way? Was this a possible way out or
 was it just a faster way under?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Awwww, Papa-Bear..
 Is, this really you Bobby? I miss you so much, you know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded quite sincere but then again crazy people always do since they
 do believe you are actually an ursine humanoid, complete with fur, claws,
 a fluffy tummy, and an unhealthy hunger for honey and Taco Bell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, Eileen.
 That's, me..
 Yeah.
 Papa-waka-bear.
 Huh..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words seemed to be drip-fed to my brain from some sort of mental black
 hole that spewed forth nothing that made sense.
 Fortunately that strongly resonated with Eileen's sense of reality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, Papa-waka-bear, so strong and furry and manly..With lots and lots of furry
 shouldery hair for me to rub and that sweet tummy..Can I see you Bobby? Just
 this once, I won't be a bother, really.
 We don't need to go boat-pedaling or skating.
 Just see you, maybe let me rub your tummy.
 And have sex?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I closed my eyes and recalled a picture from the past: myself laden with
 honey from tip to toe, tied to a bed with a Winnie the Pooh plushie wearing
 a strap-on dildo and Eileen shouting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rawr! I'm your honeycomb slice, Papa-Bear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I decided then and there that I'd have to appeal to whatever core of sanity
 remained in her mind, or else I could just go drown myself in a really
 shallow body of water, like, say, a gutter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Listen, Eileen..
 We can't..
 I can't do all that, okay? I wish I could, but..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was a lie.
 That was a lie.
 That was a lie.
 I was lying to her, but that's okay cause she's crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ohh.
 Why can't you Papa-Bear? We could have so much fun together! We could ride
 the tram around the city, and I could feed you cotton candy and berries.
 Like last time, don't you remember? Didn't you have fun? Please, Bobby.
 Can't I see you once more? Why did you call me then? Do you really want
 to hurt me, Bobby?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her voice reminded me uncannily of Boy George and that made my eyes hurt
 just by thinking about it.
 I felt my stomach knot at the thought of all the things I would have to
 endure to get on her good side.
 Or it might have been the coffee-like dirt-brew.
 I took a deep breath before uttering the words as if they were my last:
\end_layout

I need to see you Eileen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Oh, Bobby! You really can't tell how happy that makes me! I feel like leaping
 outside the window and flying to your arms, Papa-Bear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh God, shit no.
 She was crazy enough to actually pop out the window and crack her head
 open on the street below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no, Eileen! Don't do that honey, no.
 You gotta wait a couple of hours, I'll drop by your place.
 Okay?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no! Just sit tight, will ya? I'll bring you chocolate chip cookies,
 your favorite.
 Just don't go anywhere.
 And Eileen, take your meds, please.
 You're still on meds, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, you mean those horrible pills? They were so bitter and bad for me, unlike
 you Bobby.
 No, no, daddy paid off the bad men in white and now I'm home again.
 Free as a bird.
 Your little nightingale.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was probably wrong.
 No meds, rampant insanity mixed with nymphomaniac tendencies.
 And ursine fantasies.
 For a moment I thought it'd be a better bet to just reason with Falconi,
 but the fact that the last guy who tried that ended up as hand-made soap
 bars with Falconi's signature on it left me with little doubt about where
 my chances lay.
 I'd stick with the looney.
 At least she seemed to still have this thing for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okaaay, Eileen.
 Now, see Papa-Bear's in trouble and I need your help.
 So, make sure you can get a hold of daddy and tell him that you might need
 that jet of his for a trip.
 And some pocket money too.
 Tell him you're going shopping in New York, okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened myself saying all that and momentarily asked myself 'Are you
 a bad person for doing this, Bobby?', and then the answer came guilt-free
 'No, Falconi is a bad person because he wants you dead for something you
 didn't even do'.
 It also helped to think of myself as Papa-Bear and not Bobby Barhoe.
\end_layout

We're going shopping? Oh, Papa-Bear I always knew you were so much fun!

\begin_layout Standard
I hesitated just for the tiniest moment and I could almost picture the sad,
 watery eyes and then the coming onslaught of cries, curses and finely sharpened
 blades being hurled against me, so I made something like a smooching sound.
 It might have sounded like a fart, I'm not sure, but she sounded positively
 satisfied:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I love you Papa-Bear! I can't wait to snuggly-wuggly you in my arms and

Goodbye!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hang up in the nick of time.
 The ordeal was over for now, but doubts started assaulting me like journalists
 outside a rehab facility for famous people.
 Was this my only option? Would she come through? What if she had been waiting
 for that call, that one call that I might have given her in such a time
 of extenuating circumstances and dire need, just so I could come running
 to her for help and then dice me up because I shot the best-man on our
 wedding day and ran off in her father's Porsche?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had to keep reminding myself I wasn't the bad person here, even as I strode
 back into my piece-of-shit Taurus.
 These were desperate times, and they obviously required insanely desperate
 measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got back on route 72, heading for Memphis.
 While the radio waves reeked with country, bluegrass and heart-felt messages
 to the parishioners to pledge their support to the Church of Latter Day
 Saints With Semi-Automatic Rifles, I casually gazed outside the window
 and couldn't help notice that this countryside was so flat and uninteresting
 that if there was some kind of hell waiting for everyone, this would be
 it.
 I was about to start a self-gratifying rant, using phrases like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job right there, Bobby
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure I can vouch for that sleezeball Mr.
 Falconi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Heck no, nothing can go wrong, we're all pros here.
 Right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when a big brown legged thing just popped right in front of the Taurus.
 I applied pressure to the braking pedal and then the laws of physics worked
 their magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, despite appearances I'm a fairly well-educated man and I know that
 Taurus is just a fancy word for bull.
 I also know that for a car to decelerate from eighty miles-per-hour to
 zero, it takes a couple hundred feet, and that's because no-one in his
 right mind would design a car that could turn its occupants into mush or
 tarmac jelly (depending on the seat belt arrangement) when they wanted
 it to stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, I wasn't really suprised when the Taurus hit that horse.
 I wasn't really surprised when the airbag tried to rob me of what looked
 like my early dying breath.
 Surprise wasn't achieved even when the car swiveled and landed sideways
 in a gravely ditch.
 It wasn't the fact that I was still in one piece, nor the fact that the
 horse - had it been given the oral faculty post-mortem - could not say
 the same for itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the shaman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There I was, still trying to decide whether or not I was still alive and
 with my brain between my ears, when I saw through the hazy smoke and vapor
 of the smashed front of the car the figure of a lone man, looking directly
 at me with a deeply sombre gaze, as if I had just killed his horse.
 He was dressed in a brown leather jacket, criss-crossed leather vest, and
 soft tan shoes.
 I'd have wagered he was some kind of a disco enthusiast with a slightly
 bent sexual orientation, if it wasn't for the feathery hat and the somewhat
 austere, manly jaw line.
 He was the spitting image of some Cherokee.
 Or Navajo.
 I didn't know, I just knew they name cars after these kinds of people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spoke with a peculiar voice that had the impossible qualities of gravel
 and running water at the same time:
\end_layout

Are you hurt?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would normally have taken the time to think about faking some injury so
 I could sue the guy for damages.
 But under the circumstances, namely that if everything went according to
 plan I had less than a day to live combined with that this guy's entire
 estate most probably consisted of a dead horse, a tipi and his grandparents
 in a convenient ash form, I instinctively opted for the truth.
 Everything felt connected to the proper slots and I literaly (and sadly,
 figuratively as well) saw no great blinding light at the end of a tunnel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He came closer, shook open my jammed door and helped me get out of the car.
 He striked me as neither too old and neither too young, kind of exactly
 like Ronn Moss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, I think I'm okay.
 Where did you, ahm..
 I mean, the horse just popped out of nowhere, and..
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I know, Bobby.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His words had a strangely calming effect.
 They oozed serenity.
 It was like listening to the voice of a loving grandfather, and by loving
 I don't mean pedophile.
 But then it hit me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How did he know my name?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What did he mean by saying 'I know'? What did he know? I looked blankly
 at him, wondering briefly if I there was a universal balance being observed
 right at that moment.
 My impending doom, and a horse dying in front of Taurus.
 Could it be that somehow the cosmic forces of life contrived to tell me
 something? Had some sort of karmic exchange taken place right in front
 of my eyes? A horse's life, for my own? An offering, a sacrifice to the
 powers beyond reach? Was he a holy man? Some sort of shaman? An emissary
 of fate? Was this the break I so desperately needed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How did he know my name?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His next words jarred me out of my shocked reverie:

I felt a bit silly, standing right beside him on the side of the road, bending
 over looking at what must have been horse gut sprayed all over what at
 some point, had been my Taurus' radiator.
\end_layout

I'm sorry, I must've been thinking out loud.
 Well, yeah.
 Bobby Barhoe.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at me sideways, somehow failing to mask his feelings disappointment.
 I couldn't know if it was my name or the pool of blood oozing from the
 horse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What kind of a name is that, Barhoe? Seriously?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an odd think to ask, but then again I'd just run over his horse so
 I felt I should indulge the man.
 It might have also been an unconscious, fool-hardy effort to steer the
 discussion away from the dead horse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I've never really given it much thought.
 It's just a name, really.
 I actually think it sounds sturdy, homely.

He furrowed his left eyebrow in a grimace that would have normally required
 a monocle for full effect.
 I took a closer look at the steaming pile of heap that used to be the engine

 You're not a gun-crazed ape so you can't deal with Falconi going in, guns

 You are the careful, studied planner who has taken everything into consideratio

 You can't just pretent to do the job and get caught because then Falconi

 You can't find a replacement - no less in such a short notice - because

The truck driver's name was Ivan Kerrilov, and when he spoke he never failed

With safety in mind first and without taking his eyes off the road, Ivan
 took his hand off the wheel and made two little figures with his fingers
 that first walked casually next to each other, and then one seemed to bend
 over only to get the index finger of the other hand repeatedly inserted
 into an imaginary cavity.
 At first I squinted at the little charade, trying to think what could be
 going on in Ivan's stranger-fiction-mind.
 And then I saw his leery smile and rhythmical movement of his pelvis I
 irreversibly knew he was asking whether or not me and Steve were a 'thing'.
 I answered as delicately as appearances and circumstances allowed:

 asked Steve without provocation and without a care, delving deep into the

A really big truck with a streamlined design overtook us on the left, blaring
 his horn all the way.
 At the end of the huge tank he was carrying, the driver had put up a neon
 sign that said 'HONK IF YOU'RE HUNG LIKE AN ARMADILLO'.
 Before my brain had time to fully explore the possibilities that such a
 statement entailed and what it really meant (for instance, what is an armadillo
 hung like? is it hung like an anteater or other thing beginning with 'a'?),
 I was reflexively covering up my ears because Ivan had just honked, laughing
 like an immigrant version of the Woodpecker.
 On the other hand I noticed Steve was browsing through the mini-bar, which
 invariably seemed to possess enough alchohol to fire up an amateur rocket.
 Most of the tiny bottles were empty and the rest of them was emptied around
 the driver's seat.

 A split second later Steve thought it was time for some kind of psychological
 evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See now that's typical behavior of repressed sexuality.
 You have a problem opening up to society as a homosexual man, so you become
 defensive, try to look like the dominating male figure, while in fact you
 subconsciously hitched a hike with an outspokenly gay man - in a milk truck
 no less - and just a moment ago admitted you're worse at sucking cock than
 most women.
 And that's why you punched me, because in this soul-searching quest you
 are too confined by your own-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I punched him again, and this time it had the desired effect.
 He stopped talking shit and looked at me through half-open wary eyes, probably
 mindful that some things, and especially things concerning Bobby Barhoe's
 manliness were better left unsaid for a good reason that involved jarred
 bones and bruises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was visibly seething with anger.
 My male pride had been hurt.
 I almost felt like a proud elk being stripped of its horns, an elephant
 without a trunk, or a stud without its junk.
 It also felt like Ivan was eyeing me creepily, and grinning incongruously
 to every mention of a word even remotely related to intercourse, like 'milk',
 'butter', or 'hoe'.
 Before abject terror pulled at my instincts and made me leap outside a
 truck doing eighty, he turned and said to me with an approving tone, proudly
 waving a badly groomed finger in the air:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I tried not to think of that as a compliment, or even a comment of any kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve looked slightly miffed, sitting somewhat uncomfortably, nursing his
 jaw.
 It looked like the last punch had left him a purple-coloured souvenir.
 It's only reasonable then that he must've unwillingly disconnected his
 mouth from his brain when he said:

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to punch him a third time in that exact same sweet bruised spot
 and if God was a proponent of applied justice, I would have broken his
 jaw with the added bonus that that would have probably made him shit up
 for the rest of the ordeal, when I felt something with the apparent magnitude
 and force of a giant metal claw tugging at my left shoulder.
 It was Ivan who said:

 I saw the bleak unatrractive greenish scenery that reminded me of mosquitoes

 moment had arrived.
 We were about to meet Eileen.
 Which reminded me then to finish what I had started, and punch Steve in
 the face.
 A moment, a grunt and an expletive later he was complaining:

 the other way.
 He then said with conviction:

I'm not a violent man per se, and it definitely says something for a person
 when he's so eager to punch people in the face and break their legs, but
 in Steve's case, I would bet he could get the Pope mad enough to beat him
 to death with a bible.
 Before there was time to choke him to death, Ivan effectively disarmed
 me with but a few words of very special meaning:

I think my genitalia shrunk to microscopic levels instantly, and my anus

 I looked at Steve in terror and he simply smiled back, impervious to what
 the words implied for my gender.
 Impossibly, trying to ignore the inevitable I smiled back as well and thought
 that staying alive had its good moments, and its rape moments.
 This looked like a rape moment.
 And the funny thing is all I could think of was Nirvana and Kodak.

By that time I had mastered my instincts and even though a proper response

 The door buzzed and I pushed it open.
 We got inside and a powerful smell assaulted me: the smell of a shitload
 of money.
 The large entrance hall was just as I remembered.
 Stately, sparkling clean, filled with incredibly expensive luxury items
 chosen solely because of their price tag.
 There was this wide staircase that led to the upper floors, all marble
 and carpet.
 Pretty standard stuff for a cotton mogul like Eileen's father.

And that was when I caught Eileen with the corner of my eye, falling down
 on me from the floor above, wearing a free-fall jumpsuit, arms outstretched
 looking lying a flying squirrel on drugs, ready to clench me into her death-lov
e-grip.
 I barely had time to freeze like an idiot at the inane sight of her, so
 I couldn't dodge her in time (which would have been an instinctive reaction,
 no harm intended really).
 She simply fell right on top of me and we both fell on the floor.
 I was pretty certain I heard something crack, and while I tried to breath
 again, I heard Steven's voice carrying the unmistakable markings of someone
 on a cocktail of psychedelic drugs:

 I said trying to sound approving, even as I tried to squirm away from her.
 I took a look at Steve and it seemed like he was starting to develop some
 sort of real mental issue.
 He was hugging the wall, mumbling something inaudible and had the look
 of a wide-eyed deer frozen by a couple of approaching headlights.
 I managed to stand back up after a while, Eileen continuously expressing
 her endearment, handling me like a stuffed animal and calling me 'booby-woompy'
, 'etch-a-sketchy' and 'orgasmatron two', among other things.
 Before I could find a way calm her down enough to try and tell her why
 we were there, Steve finally blew a fuse and lost his marbles as if Eileen's
 condition was as catchy as the Embola virus:

I was about to punch him again just as a stop-gap measure, when I saw Eileen
 had quickly acclimatized herself to the added craziness: she was doing
 her best ninja impression, with a length of the parachute wrapped around
 her face as a mask, wielding a three-pronged candle holder like somesort
 of dagger, dancing around, blinking wildly and generally looking very much
 unlike a ninja.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I realised I now had two, instead of just one nutcases to handle, and they
 were helping each other turn me into one of them.
 I tried to fold Steve back into some kind reality that might not involve
 invisible ninja assasins.
 I grabbed him by the shoulders and unglued him from the well, trying to
 say something that made sense:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Maybe you ate something bad on the road? That sandwich? Maybe you put some

His face looked like splitting for just a moment.
 He then blurted:

No chance! Peyote tastes like rabbit pee, that sandwich tasted like snake

 he said and Eileen hove into view with an aerial kick that managed to overturn
 a small

 It also cost me my meager grip on Steve who just snapped at exactly the
 wrong moment.

\end_inset

They're here, man! We got to torch this place! Let me go man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, kicked me in the nuts and ran away while I collapsed in agony,
 seeing bright spots of many vivid colours and what might have been the
 faint image of a nun wearing a bikini and shorts.
 As I lay down on a persian carpet feeling my balls' declare their independence,
 my gaze unwillingly locked out of focus at what must've been an original
 Trego, and had this had happened to someone else, I'd find the coincidence
 quite charming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen was all over me in the blink of an eye.
 Her eyes looked watery already and she shrieked right into my ear with
 the overtones of a caring nympho:

Oh, Bobby! Bad uncle-bear kicked you in the naughty bits! I'll kiss it better,

While it might've been a welcome change in pace, I had to gather my wits,

\begin_layout Standard
I still lay there panting though, unable to fathom how I'd put myself in
 a situation that involved a crazy woman, a recently acquainted bonafide
 shaman able to summon spirits in possession of a definitely disturbed mind.
 It really felt like a balls-to-the-wall moment.
 I felt Eileen do something really awkward to my hair and then I saw she
 was tasting it, an all too well-known dominating her features.
 I knew then I needed to get up, knock some sense into Steve, preferably
 force-feeding him some of Eileen's leftover meds that were bound to be
 found around the house.
 The developments though, outpaced me, when Steve came into view shouting:

\begin_layout Standard
He looked every bit as mad as a mad scientist of native american heritage
 would, complete with his feathery hat on and wildly unkempt hair.
 Eileen was still hunched right beside me, tracing the carpet with a finger,
 probably unable to understand why there were no puddles ripping outwards
 from the fluffy sea.

Once more in my life, I felt I was on the forefront of modern psychiatric
 analysis and treatment.
 What made things a little different, a bit more urgent and a lot more dangerous
 than what metnal illness professionals faced (more aptly, blabbermouths
 with a degree and a all-you-can-eat LSD buffet at work).
 I knew that gas was notoriously known for a tendency to make things explode
 in flames.
 So I just used, plain, simple, hard logic to try and put things under control
 before it was too late.
 I simply told Steve what I thought of the whole situation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to picture such a pink, fiendishly devious ninja for a moment, but
 thankfully I failed.
 I tried to make Steve see thing my way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, let's just pretend this place needed some cleansing, and you went
 and turned on the gas in the kitchen.
 But you didn't disconnect the safeties, did you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve held up a handful of nuts, bolts and valves that looked very out of

 I kept my cool and asked him without trembling, at least not visibly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What about that sparkle Steve? You'd have to light it up somehow, man.
 You wouldn't be that crazy, say lighting up a match now, would you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I heard Eileen's syrupy voice coming from the direction of the
 kitchen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Papa-bear? Why didn't you say your tummy was empty? I could've cooked you
 your favorite, honey apple-pie with salmon and turkey eggs! And you forgot
 to put some real food along with that tin-foil in the microwave oven, silly
 Bobby!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I tried to make sense of that statement, Steve said the most sensible
 thing I had heard out of his mouth in quite some time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just run!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had this awkward sensation tingling inside my gut.
 Time seemed to flow much more gently suddenly.
 And I think I started running like some kind of wild animal that sees the
 fires approaching, consuming everything, and flees.
 Only for some inexplicable reason, I wasn't fleeing.
 I wasn't running outside the house.
 I ran inside the kitchen, and saw Eileen happily glued in front of the
 microwave with the tin foil inside, waiting for the clock to reach zero.
 In the sparse few seconds that I envisaged I had yet to live, I grabbed
 her by the waist and carried her outside like a brat about to get a thorough
 beating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't paying thorough attention but I believe she was laughing her heart
 out, flapping her outstretched arms like we were headshowing a very cheap
 production of The Valkyrie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I passed through the open door, I could see Steve running in front of
 me, and realised his athletic scholarship wasn't just some bullshit he'd
 made up.
 I saw the courtyard, and beyond that I could see the path leading to the
 road, and when I felt this giant hand push me up in the air with an urgency
 that belied its deadliness, I realised the bird's-eye view is highly overrated
 and quite unpleasant if one does not possess the ability to land safely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fraction of a second later my ears were ravaged by the sound of the explosion
 that had propelled me and Eileen into the air.
 I had just enough time to think that it was a really shitty thing to die
 about a day earlier than you were supposed to, right before my face connected
 with the dirt horribly and everything went pitch black with a terrible
 thud.

When I came to, I opened my eyes tentatively, half-expecting John the ghost

 SUVs blocking the view to my Taurus, forever and ever.
 Instead, I was cheerfully greeted by Steve who had conveniently propped
 me up against an apple tree which looked like it might have been as old
 as the one that led to the discovery of gravity (a non-trivial force which
 I could vividly remember having challenged with little success).

I instinctively went about finding out whether that was indeed the case,
 and when all the body math checked out I happily concurred that indeed
 I was wholesome.
 I actually felt great.
 I thought it must've been a miracle that I hadn't even broken a single
 bone.
 It was a most welcome turn of events, surviving a gas explosion intact.
 So much in fact that I felt compelled to ask without worry:

And then I saw her lying flat on the ground, her hair curled up around her
 face, tangled like she had just washed her face.
 She looked insanely serene, and that pun was not intended.
 She really looked peaceful.
 Like in a deep sleep or..
 The thought just flashed across my mind like it was being stamped with
 the words by a really fierce customs officer, and my mouth moved of its

What the words implied instantly made my brain sent powerful signals accross
 my body, urging me to go ballistic.
 Holding my head with one hand I could feel my pulse grow stronger and stronger,

 I heard Eileen's voice sweet and calming, as if everything was right as
 pie:

I could see the fire trucks and the sheriff's office had done their part,
 and had extinguished the fire.
 The mansion had turned into a very big piece of charcoal, and we were safely
 and quite pertinently almost half a mile away, idly sitting under a tree,
 looking as innocent as any picknickers.
 The mansion was pretty much far down the road, so there weren't really
 any bystanders or eye-witnessess, and that only meant it would merely be
 a matter of minutes until someone noticed us and thought about coming around
 and start asking questions.
 Steve was probably on the same train of thought when he said somewhat hesitantl

 I said and knew it wasn't me saying that.
 I covered my mouth with one hand in shocked surprise, while the other one
 was on my waist adding to a very feminine body posture which must've looked
 very ridiculous and gay, perhaps much to the chagrin of Steve who paused
 and turned around looking at me like there was overwhelming evidence of
 something weird going on.
 He sighed and said:

I suddenly could move again as if some invisible cords had just snapped.
 I flexed my muscles as if they had been brand new again, and then I dutifully
 proceeded to lift Eileen up and carry her on my shoulder.
 She was a lithe little thing and she wouldn't be a bother until we could
 get down to the road and maybe hail a cab.
 Steve looked a bit worried though, so I asked him:

I think I frowned really hard when I heard that, almost trying to connect
 one eyebrow with the other.
 I was inclined to ask Steve about his thoughts on the strategy of preemptive
 strikes in general, colloquially known as 'shoot first, ask questions later',
 and in this particular instance 'punch first, then punch again'.
 But somehow I felt it would be a very counterproductive thing to do, at
 least until this situation with Eileen had been resolved.

Steve cleared his throat and settled into a calm, even voice.
 It was what could have passed as the voice of a narrator in a boring documentar

Part of the ritual involves letting the spirits run wild, and free.
 Best way to do that, is make you act like yourself, speak with the heart
 if you will.
 Normally, we would have spend weeks together in the wild, hunting, bonding,
 perhaps bathing naked in ice cold streams, with nothing but the cloudy
 sky for a roof and our knives for shelter.
 The light of the stars would have shone in our souls, and our spirits would
 mingle with the Father Wind, the changer of all things not set in stone.
 And you would learn to feel the currents of Mother Earth flow within you,
 all living things as one force, separate but not divided, unique but not
 alone.
 And your spirit would be ready then.
 But because we had to do this real quick, I improvised and nearly killed
 us all.
 It worked better than I expected.

As we reached the side of the road, I saw a sign right across the other
 side advertising cheap food, strong coffee and liquor, and I quote: 'fit
 for pharmaceutical use'.
 I was genuinely surprised then to see Steve wet his lips with his tongue,
 and look at me with an expression that verged on what I believe mental
 health professionals (yeah, the overpaid quacks) call bipolar disorder.
 The left part of his face was contorted in a jarred grimace, the kind of
 mess that happens to your face when you realise you've put yourself into
 a situation that can only result in abject, petrifying horror or death-of-the-s
oul (kinda like visiting the in-laws or watching the eight o'clock news).

The other half, his right half, shone with the intensity and brilliance

I was getting the impression that Eileen's spirit was somehow different,

 Just without the craziness.

 my hopes on a ghost and a shaman with a drinking problem.

Mama Adele had laid out a really delicate tablecloth, the color of blinding
 white.
 A small feast had been laid out on the table, and the overpowering smell
 of freshly baked cornbread filled the small, homely kitchen.
 Steve was sitting opposite me, hesitant to start eating, constantly flicking
 his gaze between Mama Adele, me, and his plate.
 I was playing around with my fork, trying to appear as I was ready to start
 eating any moment now while in fact I was classifying the potatos on my
 plate according to size, shape, and complexion (an old habit I inherited
 while doing time in prison - it really helped with trying to not think
 about the showers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen's body was upstairs, comfortably lying in bed.
 Even though I could use a bit of a nap myself at that point, there was
 very little precious time to waste, and Mama Adele did not help things
 by insisting that we sat down and had supper.
 When she saw Eileen was out cold it seemed as if someone had pulled away
 the world under her feet.
 We told her half of the truth: some kind of trouble, the mansion burned
 to the ground, Eileen knocked unconscious, safe and sound but in need of
 rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She'd known the line of business I was in and that I've had some shady dealings
 in the past, and that her father wasn't exactly a virgin in the domain
 of law-breaking, so she knew that whatever it was he had gotten her into,
 a hospital would be a bad idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
God bless her soul, she grudgingly took her in, on two conditions nevertheless:
 one, that we'd sit down, eat supper, have some coffee, a nice long talk
 and perhaps a couple of beatings.
 Two, if Eileen didn't wake up soon, she'd put a curse on me so vile, that
 I'd wish I'd never been conceived, much less born, and so evil, that'd
 make the devil and all his minions look like pussies (these were, to my
 recollection, her exact words).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She had the relevant experience in the ju-ju crafts and all sorts of dead
 animal parts, as well as all the spunk and the ferocity of a really old
 black lady that had raised Eileen like she had been her own.
 Her dry wrinkled face nevertheless sported piercing cougar-like eyes, and
 if looks could kill, hers would have been a weapon of mass destruction.
 I noticed she was eyeing me with just that kind of a look, and while Eileen
 inside me urged me once more to tell her the truth, before I could open
 my mouth and speak a single word, she motioned me to stay silent, waving
 a bony arthritis-swollen finger and saying:

 He opened his mouth to speak, but Mama Adele still had the advantage and
 it didn't look like she was going to give it up anytime soon.
 She put up one hand with a warning finger that made us pause and watch

Normally the sight of a - probably senile - old woman undressing would have

 lost any meaningful function since before the moon landing.

Steve me gave a startled look, and I saw his eyes filled with the gleam

 on the table, her voice craggy but fierce:

I swallowed with some difficulty.
 The old woman certainly had been strongly opinionated in the past, having
 called me a 'beelze-bob' and a 'a peck of a cock' among other less colourful
 and not as endearing terms.
 But it looked like she had finally grown really old, and thusly, really
 weird in many ways, to the point that some courts would probably even deem
 she had lost her marbles for good.
 'Just like Eileen,' I said in my mind and quite without expecting to, I
 picked up the jar of water and unloaded its contents on my head.
 `I'm not crazy!' she said inside my head, and I could feel her recide to
 a silent corner at the back of my head, as if she was suddenly holding
 a grudge against me.

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was looking at me as if I had just won a wet T-shirt contes.
 Perhaps he was trying to make some kind of signal the way his eyes seemes

Mama Adele put down the chicken leg, and reached for the large table knife.
 I watched Steve slowly but deliberately inch his hand to the large fork
 still stuck on the chicken.
 Mama Adele said then with an unusual and rather haughtily manner, in a

 And so much more than you're able to comprehend,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 she said and then I felt Eileen inside me come to the forefront of my mind
 and take control of every muscle, fibre and bone on my body.
 I think I shouted something like `the fuck you are bitch' and then the
 next few moments turned into what could only be described as a pretty impressiv
e show of how old cutlery can be given new life by putting them to outstanding
 use as lethal weapons.
 Plus I was surprised to learn that my body could move like, well, like
 a god-damn ninja.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mama Adele lunged at me with the table knife, aiming for a good clear cut
 of my throat.
 But everything was suddenly felt like we were underwater: her movement
 was slow and sluggish, even for an eighty year old woman coming at me for
 a knife, she moved like she was surrounded by jello.
 And so was Steve, who had picked the fork up and was bringing it down with
 quite some force from what I could read in his ridiculously taut face,
 which looked more and more like his real problem was a bad case of constipation.
 To make matters worse, the fork was still attached to the chicken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While my body moved in its own ways, in ways that Eileen was probably to
 thank for, I had all the time in the world to think about what had just
 happened, seeing as everything seemed to move barely a notch faster than
 a Jewish snail on a Sabbath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, Mama Adele had this little weird moment of speaking in tongues,
 along with Steve who maybe had the bigger picture here.
 Then Eileen's spirit took control of my body at what must've been a very
 fortuitous time, because I don't think I could have dodged that knife fast
 enough to maintain the ability to swallow without getting wet 
\shape italic
every single time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only did I dodge that knife, but I actually craned my neck backwards
 in a graceful move, with the knife missing me by no more than an inch,
 and then I thrust the table away with my legs.
 Even as I fell, I saw my hands extending to touch the wall, and leaving
 my body lying horizontally in mid-air, between the table and the wall,
 with Mama Adele realising she had missed and giving her knife another swing,
 only this time she was apparently - and this was a disturbing and painful
 thought - aiming for my balls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the corner of my eye I could see Steve finally realising the chicken
 was still hanging by that damnable fork, and he was duly making some very
 clumsy efforts at separating the two: he looked very miffed about it though,
 I'll give him that, and even as he swung the fork and the chicken above
 his head looking like a world-class hammer thrower, I could see he was
 quite frustrated but also determined to literally, pull it off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that sitting back and watching the fight unfold in front of my eyes
 like a cheap B-rated film, did nothing to hamper what Eileen was doing
 with my body.
 We were quite literally two people in one body, so while I craved for some
 pop-corn and soda to watch the action, Eileen was making the action happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It struck me as odd, that while there was this apparent struggle to the
 death between the three of us, I felt calm and relaxed, as if this was
 happening to someone else.
 From a logical standpoint, there was really nothing I could do, so watching
 and fretting about it wouldn't be of any help.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I just watched, as Mama Adele ripped my jeans open with her knife right
 at the seam of the crotch, missing the holiest of holies by a curly hair's
 breadth.
 No worries then I thought, and abruptly saw the room spin, watching the
 ceiling give its place to the floor and then the ceiling came into view
 once again, only this time my knee had connected violently with Mama Adele's
 face and I was surprised to find out there were so many cheap dentures
 still in the market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only that, but I also put my hands deftly on the floor, kicked out and
 away hitting her groin, and then before she had time to even breath, I
 had managed to coil myself like a spring and then use the momentum to snap
 back upright, putting all the extra energy into a left-handed fist I swear
 could have knocked out a hippo on a rampage.
 Unfortunately though, she wasn't a rampaging hippo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know I felt her jaw crack and the force should have been enought to snap
 her neck.
 It was a killing blow, for sure.
 Whatever Eileen was doing with my body, and she was doing it extremely
 well, she didn't mean to just stop Mama Adele: she was trying to kill her
 outright.
 The problem was that Adele, or the gowa-na-di-tche as Steve had called
 her, wasn't on the same page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hook sent her reeling off the table, but somehow she used her hands
 like a fourteen year-old gymnast and turned the punch into a somersault
 that send her almost flying across the kitchen and a few feet away into
 the small living room where the TV was still on, showing a very familiar
 guy with wiry hair smiling on a beach wearing silly red shorts and surrounded
 by a plethora of large boobs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was finally able to pull the fork free of the chicken.
 When he talked I noticed that his mouth moved and I couldn't hear a thing.
 I half expected to hear everything slowed down and sounding badass or perhaps
 like an amateur satanic ritual, just like when your walkman is running
 low on batteries.
 Instead, I heard myself as clear as day:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 and then she came at us with superelderly speed, knife in one hand and
 a very heavy-looking glass vase in the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I couldn't see what Steven was doing since I had focused on Adele.
 I stood there motionless as a stone pillar, and I saw in that same slowed
 down vision Adele coming closer and closer at an alarming pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A part of me wanted to duck, run, sprint away, make myself scarce, slide
 under the table and magically disappear, faster than possible, preferably
 at some point in the past.
 Another part of me wanted a sawed-off shotgun loaded with some double-aught
 buckshot, and an itchy trigger finger would be happily supplied by yours
 truly.
 I do not consider myself a violent person who believes armed confrontation
 is the best way to resolve a clash of interests, but seriously, the bitch
 tried to cut my throat and then my dick.
 She'd be so full of lead that the she'd become Radioactive's Man best dead
 buddy, at least until the next reboot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I did nothing of the sort.
 And Eileen seemed to be doing nothing at all, while I could clearly make
 out the reddish glow in Adele's eyes, as well as the blinding sheen of
 the knife in her hand, which was certainly pointed the wrong way, and was
 certainly past the `I'm just fucking with you' range.
 Which was a troubling thing, considering that the large, heavy vase had
 been launched, and the smart money was that my face was the target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I thought that something had gone horribly wrong in a very small amount
 of time, and Eileen's spirit had suddenly remembered that it had let some
 sort of spiritual stove on, and had duly and without warning left everything
 hanging, without extending the slightest courtesy of returning control
 of my body to me, or at least killing the screaming bitch first and 
\shape italic
then
\shape default
 doing the equivalent of laundry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I saw her toothless, gaping maw grinning with the excitement of an easy,
 assured kill, I also felt my body swiveling to the right from the waist
 up.
 I arched my back slightly backwards and saw the vase in all its glory from
 a very prestigious point of view, flying right past my nose, spilling very
 tiny droplets of water in its path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only a foot away, Adele's hand was already half-way through its downward
 stabbing motion and the knife wasn't missing.
 She had actually jumped in the air with bent knees, adding her weight to
 the force of the stab and presenting a somewhat smaller target.
 That's what it all looked like from my point of view, but I would be willing
 to bet the proverbial farm that this whole mess of a fight looked like
 a cheap parody of `300', with old ladies instead of Spartan soldiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, it looked real enough when I suddenly swooped under her arching arm
 with a superbly fluid motion and punched her straight in the nose with
 the back of my hand, while with my other arm I blocked her strike and gripped
 her arm in a vice.
 It was superbly executed and though I know nothing about martial arts,
 I instantly knew this would have looked great on Jackie Chan film.
 There was though, a small mistake that complicated things at the last possible
 moment and gave Adele a fighting chance, and that was a plain and simple,
 standard knee-in-the-nuts move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, I was in pain, and even though Eileen was in control of my
 body, I could sure as hell feel it reaching every inch of my body, spreading
 like a wildfire from the groin outwards.
 Secondly, I had little time to reflect on why or how Eileen's spirit had
 proven to be so adept at unarmed combat, but I was pretty sure that it
 had been conditioned in a woman's body because the way I moved left the
 precious stones quite vulnerable to someone with a cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I reflexively released Adele's arm from my grip with one hand, my
 other one reached for my nuts, a reflex that never served any purpose other
 than leaving one unable to block any kind of hit, unless using one's head
 counted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I started to slowly but surely fall down on my knees in an ironically
 dangerous example of the saying `the spirit is willing, but the flesh is
 weak', I saw the sinister look on Adele's face and thought that it all
 felt suddenly very much like game over, with no credits left and all the
 pocket money gone, forever.
 I saw Adele's knife hand swooping down from a corner of my eye, going in
 for my throat once more, not to cut, but to stab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of her legs was about to meet my jawline and her free hand was just
 standing there, looking somewhat left out of the whole action.
 On a closer inspection, having nothing else to do while my body was unable
 to save us from a deadly stab and the many others like it that would probably
 ensue, I noticed her hand had gone slightly limb.
 And then I saw in great, shining detail a pitched fork squarely stuck between
 her forehead and an eye that seemed to be incredibly soft and squishy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other end of the fork was connected to Steve's hand, which in turn was
 thankfully still connected to the rest of Steve.
 I felt the pain numbing my senses, and the time flow normally once more.
 I was panting from the exertion feeling too weak to even attempt to get
 up, while Steve kept uttering the same kind of giberrish from before, the
 fork in his hand glowing with a bluish, white-hot intensity that seemed
 definitely wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adele was now frozen in place, her knife lying on the floor.
 Steve's veins were jutting out like someone had run a thick cable through
 them, and he was generally looking very fierce, pissed off and quite certain
 that Adele was a bad person, seeing how he kept trying to twist the fork
 deeper into her skull.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later, she threw her hands into the air felt on her lifeless, arthritis
-ridden knees, but not before she could speak with a venomous quality that
 reminded me of snake bites and show-biz journalists:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said and slumped on the floor, appearing to be, for all intents and
 purposes, dead as a dodo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steven was panting as well, his face marked with the signs of incredible
 effort but immense relief as well.
 I felt I could try using the table as something to use as a standing aid,
 and did so with moderate success, while the pain receded with each passing
 moment, turning into a numbing sensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was some silence while Steven pulled up a chair and just sat there,
 looking at the floor, his long hair in front of his face waving slightly
 by the wind of his breath.
 He reached for the inside of his jacket then, brought out his feathery
 hat, unfolded it and put it on his head all curled up still, looking shoddy
 and wrecked, as if someone had been carrying it in a pocket this whole
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at Adele's body with a degree of disdain that could only be comparable
 that shown towards a pile of dog poo, and said with a gloating roar:

 on the floor, looking inappropriately gruesome with the fork sticking out
 of her forehead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What does that even mean? For starters, what the fuck was that all about?

\begin_layout Standard

 said Steve with a weary voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though thought is advertised as instant, it does take a little time to formulate

 said with the slightest hint of ennui in my voice:

She says, I should ask you.

\begin_layout Standard
My eyes caught the mess on the table, and I singled out the single salvageable
 thing: the chicken.
 My stomach made all the sounds usually associated with being starved, and
 then some.
 I sat down, dug in, and ripped a wing off the chicken.
 I immediately started munching away like someone set to enter into the
 Guiness World Book of Records as the human eating machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I heard Steve say:

My stomach was churning like the Atlantic Sea, and I let out a small, rather

 I replied smartly and smiled encouragingly.

 I said, and though I had some suspicions, I couldn't believe it even when

I was sipping at some sludge that Steve had made, insisting it was coffee,

 telling the truth, I could not think of it as anything other than a cup
 of swamp water with some mud thrown in for flavor.
 Fortunately for me, he made lousy coffee but perfect Heimlich maneuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We had been talking for the better part of an hour, old Mama Adele still
 lying on the floor since no-one had bothered to even move it out of the
 way, just for the sake of appearances and good taste.
 I'd learned that there was some solid reasoning behind that as well.
 Some of the things Steve had said though still didn't fit, so I asked more
 questions, expecting some kind of answers.
 You'd be surprised how more often than not, the answers bring about more
 questions.

Mama Adele was the agent, that's for sure.
 But she was just an instrument.

 Someone else was behind that.

 behalf of someone else, for sure.

Yes, it is clear to me now, as it is painfully clear to her.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, not really crazy.
 That was just her imprisonment spell.
 A lock on her spirit.
 Even someone as powerful as her needs time to realise she had been living
 under a spell for decades.
 Played like a puppet, and by none other than the one person she felt cared
 the most.
 Must've been like a backstab through the heart.

\begin_layout Standard

But she's not really Eileen then either.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I guess not.
 Though some of her, the real Eileen, must have been part of that persona

By Las Vegas standards, it's like half a lifetime.
 Yeah, I know what you're thinking, and this might sound like something
 a cheap son of a bitch would say, but hear me out.
 I was young, rash, and adventurous, and had just done this job at a small
 but profitable motel.
 I had gate crashed this wild party where anything seems normal enough,
 and while I was drunk off my mind, mostly on the feeling of success of
 a job well done, I saw Eileen wearing a silly red hat, painted blue, and
 wearing a bikini made of less cloth than the standard handkerchief.
 I just felt I had to do papa-Smurf before I died, so I used my charm on
 her and before I knew it, I was wearing a ring, and singing the Smurfs
 theme, doing 80 in a rented Lincoln convertible headed for Memphis to meet
 my in-laws.

Well, yeah.
 That might've played a small part.
 You know, base human instincts like greed can turn a good man into a shadow

And then what happened?

I slapped myself hard on the face, and went rigid.
 Then Eileen took over and she didn't sound very happy about what she could
 remember, in lucid detail:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll tell you what happened, mani-chi-kwa, spirit guide of the Alabama.
 Bobby here, sweet ol' Bobby, took advantage of my weakened mental state,

 Like this dead bitch here who had been my captor and jailer for all these
 mournful years.
 Let her spirit be carried away to the void, when the time of reckonening
 comes.

I placed my hands on the table, and felt Eileen's anger pulsate through
 my veins:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I searched inside this man's mind and soul, and found out some shred of
 love for me was true.
 But his wickedness overcame his better human nature, and wealth blinded
 him.
 That was why he took off with whatever he could find in that safe, and
 why he has to repay me for this act of mine: Bobby Barhoe, I forgive you.
 I only feel loss and sorrow for the mother that bore this child you call
 Eileen into this world, for she had a sweet soul, and was an innocent creature.
 But the father..
 The father must burn.

Steve looked rather concerned and wary suddenly, fearing that a guardian
 spirit to say such thing was perhaps going to far in the pursuit of justice
 and spiritual balance.
 He asked then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Surely aka-ne-wha-de, you have been wronged terribly and justice must be
 served, and balanced restored.
 But we killed this demon's host, and you're awakened and free.
 What good will come of that burning that you speak?

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Mani-chi-kwa, you are an example to your people and your tribe.
 But you are but an infant, a small child caught in a terrible wind.
 I fear I have been too late to wake.
 I have to thank you, and even Bobby here, for what you started.
 But do not make the mistake and think of me as a plagued human spirit anymore.
 I am Aka-ne-wha-de, and I shine brighter on the lonely path each soul must
 take.

With that being said, I was released from her grip and felt a great burden

Easy now, Bobby, take a breath.
 You could be collecting shards from ants, and mice, and even rocks.

The guardian's spirit saw the good in you, and the ritual I performed allowed
 her to free herself from her bonds, and find shelter in your body.
 But her true self lay dormant, and didn't wake up until she had to face
 the demon, the gowa-na-di-tche.
 That was when she realised who she really was, and what had happened to
 her.
 It seems that now she might want to do something about setting things right
 before returning to the spirit-world where she belongs.

Alright, that's cool.
 That's her thing, happy to help and all, but where do I stand? I mean,
 that's really fucking mind-blowing, guardian spirits, demons, spirit-prisons,
 Eileen not being crazy, me somewhere amidst all that supernatural mayhem,
 but Falconi will have my ass, and you know very well that no matter how
 long and hard I run and hide, my days will be considerably shorter and
 miserable to the point I'll likely just show up and let him put me to the
 ground sooner rather than later.
 So, I'm asking you? Are we good? Are we still on, like John said? Are we
 going to get to the damn parking lot, bring John back do the job and get
 Falconi off my back, or have I almost died four times just for the laughs?

And right about that time, I saw Eileen, the flesh and blood Eileen, looking

 She was walking again then, which meant she had woken up, and there was

 One, the `demon' as you call him wouldn't have to wait all this time to
 get inside this body.
 And two, which is I'm really surprised you forgot but I'm eager to believe
 is due to the shock and stress of all this, you killed the host so you
 send the spirit to the spirit-world, and now he can't come back unless
 he's summoned.
 Anyone did any summoning while I changed bodies? I wouldn't think so.

Sometimes, the human mind has the propensity to eschew the really important
 stuff that pass through it, oblivious to the larger picture, indifferent
 to what's going on beyond it's comfort zone.
 Instead of being troubled by a crisis in the economy and a future without

There's a very good explanation for that and it usually has to do with the

 What I cannot see and I cannot touch, is probably of no interest to me,

 And that's why, I couldn't think I had about twelve hours to live.

\begin_layout Standard
The Country Cotton Candy fair did not involve any kind of cotton candy whatsoeve
r, despite its name.
 It mainly involved lots of people consuming large quantities of left-over
 soon-to-go-bad pork ribs, of whom most were drunk or definitely in the
 process of becoming so.
 As a bonus, most of them seemed to be relatives in all sorts of ways that
 were illegal in twenty-three states.
 On top of that, a significant percentage of the crowd seemed eager to perpetuat
e the tradition of keeping things in the family, and was eagerly working
 on making more relatives in situ, and in public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were there because Eileen had made a couple of calls.
 I thought she would just woosh about in some sort of tasteless ghost and
 freighten people out of their minds to get the info we needed, but it seems
 that in most cases just picking up the phone and lying your ass off to
 certain people with a straight face works miracles.
 Some people actually believed we were calling on behalf of the Elvis' Secret
 Moon Base Society, and a few of them could actually remember having attended
 one of balls.
 On the moon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, all that bullshit on the phone paid off and we learned that Novorski
 was sponsoring the fair -a highly prestigious event considering the amount
 of vomit already visible- and had been scheduled to appear right about
 midnight, say a couple of words to the gathered crowd and then probably
 go back to counting cottonballs in his well-guarded warehouse complex,
 complete with electric fences, a minefield, and a piranha-filled moat,
 with trained alligators for guards, riding sharks armed with lasers and
 rocket jets.
 That last bit of information could not be easily confirmed and was a bit
 doubtful, seeing as it came from a member of the local press, the same
 one who had insisted that he had attended an Elvis' Secret Moon Base Society
 ball, on the moon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fire at the mansion hadn't been on the news, and his private secretary
 hadn't said anything about canceling the appearance, though she had sounded
 very interested hearing about the Midget Awareness program going on in
 St.
 Cuthbert's and the annual Ms.
 Crucifix pageant.
 It seemed then that plan B was our best choice.
 Any plan with followed by the letter `B', usually is preceded by a plan
 A.
 Which is to say, the fair wasn't part of the original plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd popped the obvious idea that maybe Eileen being his daughter and all
 could just waltz up his office, ring the bell, get inside, say `Hi Dad'
 and stab him repeatedly with something sharp until he bled to death.
 But that wouldn't work because know she'd awakened, she was giving away
 a spirit aura that anyone properly attuned could see just by looking at
 her.
 Even though it sounded a lot like `I've got this awful headache', and `I
 can't do this lying down', she was pretty convincing when she tuned her
 aura to the visible spectrum as well, and I was surprised to know that
 the human eye could actually see all those colours without going blind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that idea being unfeasable, Eileen come up with a novel approach to
 the problem, based around a simple, easy to follow strategy that had proven
 extremely popular in the past, with the foremost memorable example being
 the Charge of the Light Brigade: Just barge in his warehouse office, kill
 him, and burn him with some gasoline or any other flammable material, except
 perhaps bourbon.
 It's useful to remember that even though the Light Brigade went down in
 history as a self-sacrificing act of heroic courage, sadly none of the
 men involved were available for a comment at the time of their honourable
 death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being a professional thief, one of the job requirements is being able to
 examine the many minutiae that comprise a plan and make an assessment of
 the plan's viability and chance of success, based on experience and preferably
 dependable, current information, taking into consideration the chance of
 acceptable losses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having taken all that into account, and after prolonged and thoughtful deliberat
ion, the idea of barging in Novorski's office could only be compared to
 a village of natives in the Amazon waking up one day, and deciding they
 were the rightful rulers of the entire world, before promptly setting out
 to conquer everyone else armed with sticks, spears, stones, and the occasional
 sharp tropical fruit, arguing amongst themselves that the one hiccup in
 their plan was whether or not their canoes would be able to provide the
 required logistics support, mainly mangoes and coke leaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, it was beyond silly.
 It was suicidal.
 So, we'd gone with plan B, which was to kill Novorski -who was in fact
 a demon, I had to keep reminding myself- right there, at the fair.
 The where and how remained to be seen.
 Probably once he had made his little speech.
 Maybe in some thick bush, while he was taking a pee, or inadvertently while
 stargazing.
 We'd have to wing it, and my spider-sense tingled erratically whenever
 I had to wing things, which had been a lot in the past few hours.
 So plan B didn't account so much for a plan and ergo wasn't that much better
 than plan A, but it did not involve sharks, piranhas, trained alligators,
 lasers, machine gun fire and assaulting what was in effect, a small fortress.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What it did involve though was somehow getting close enough to Novorski
 to lure him someplace quiet away from the crowd, doing what had to be done
 and then burning the host without people getting in the way and asking
 questions like `why are you trying to stab that nice man?', or hearing
 the announcer say `oh golly, someone's shot Mr.
 Novorski in the head! What a show folks, eh? Now, y'all have some of those
 ribs'.
 As the saying goes, discretion is the better part of valor.
 Since my idea of valor was staying in the shadows and creeping silently
 behind the enemy at his most vulnerable time and spot, that also meant
 I was a big fan of discretion as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was hot, damp, and dusk had just fallen.
 The fair was taking place at this large old barge station right by the
 riverside, where the smell of cotton seed oil mingled with whatever happened
 to be floating in the river, and the resulting odour was less than agreeable.
 We were wading through the milling crowds, doing light reconnaisance work,
 identifying the stage where Novorski would appear, and all the while being
 careful not to attract unwanted attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That translated into avoiding the usual hotspots in the gathered crowd,
 namely blind drinking contests (named so because the winner usually ends
 up with optic nerve damage), prostitutes (sex workers is a more catchy
 term, but in Memphis they still call them whores), and alligator fights
 (popular opinion is that the losing 'gator is turned into women's accessories,
 but some local news outlets circulated some rather more sinister rumors).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shorts were the practical attire of choice for women, and since somehow
 they always looked shorter, and therefore better on women, I had one more
 reason to stay transfixed on Eileen's behinds as she waded through the
 crowd, surveying the place and filling in the gaps in the details of our
 little plan.
 She turned around suddenly once more and knew I had been focusing my attention
 on her butt once again.
 I smiled reflexively without bothering to think this was the new Eileen,
 and promptly enough I was in a position to try and remember the constellations
 of the northern hemisphere.

 I heard someone say, and then I realised that it was Steve who was unfortunatel

 It seemed like when he said `I gotta go pee', he had actually meant `I
 need to go get drunk as skunk', which was perfectly reasonable taking into
 account that he had a drinking problem (those kind of people are still
 called alcoholics in Memphis).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one needed proof of that, all one had to do was take a look at him and
 notice the shiny, embalmed and thusly quite dead skunk he was holding in
 one hand, the obscenely shaped carrot dangling in front of his nose tied
 with a red T-string around his head, and last but not least the fact that
 he had been carrying a ten-gallon beer can strapped on his back, with a
 regulator valve hanging over his shoulder, wearing nothing other than rubber
 boots and some boxer shorts sporting the american bald eagle, front and
 back.

 I rummaged in my pocket, found a fifty-cent, and left it on the stand.
 I was about to ask Eileen why Steve's drunken stupor was a good thing,
 when I heard the actually slightly bearded woman behind me say with indignation

The many ways in which the sentence didn't make sense threatened to bog

Midnight was approaching fast.
 Eileen had gone to great lengths to explain her idea fully, but somehow
 I still had my reservations.
 I always did when things approached the hour of truth, and this was no
 different a case.
 It actually was far more important than any job, heist, robbery or con
 I had pulled off before.
 She had made it perfectly clear that Novorski, the demon was to be killed
 and burned, but not before she had a chance to ask a few very important
 questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we didn't get what we wanted out of Novorski, she had made it perfectly
 clear that no amounts of spirit shards would open a doorway to the afterworld,
 the Parking Lot of Eternity and John.
 And that was something that curiously enough had to do with me, not Steve,
 and definitely not her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't sure if she wasn't just playing me to her own ends, but then again
 I thought Steve had been a fed, which would have meant the FBI's standards
 were stooping too low, even for the likes of them.
 Giving her the benefit of the doubt and having no real alternative, I jumped
 on the wagon and assumed my place, waiting for her signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could have said that things were ticking along with military precision
 if it wasn't for Steve who was roaming the stands making lewd gestures,
 not being able to hold his water like a grown-up should, making faces and
 obscene gestures at passers-by, and generally blending in sseamlessly with
 the rest of the fair-going crowd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I kept my eyes continuously on him, and part of my job involved keeping
 tags on him.
 For the most part though, Eileen had entrusted me with a role that made
 good use of my existing set of skills; primarily lying, stealing, and running
 with the intention of not getting caught under no circumstances whatsoever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the better part of about two hours, I had been plying my trade like
 a pro.
 First, I tried picking some wallets, but most were devoid of cash, filled
 with pennies, plastic money, the occasional condom, and the usual NRA member's
 card.
 I switched to trying and lift some cash off the various stands, but all
 I got was some mexican pesos, some one-dollar bills in half, and monopoly
 money, which seemed to be legal tender here but wouldn't be any use in
 the real world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had been any other day, I would have called it quits, and gone home to a
 glass of wine and watch any film at eleven that didn't involve alien sex
 or Sigourney Weaver.
 But I had to make it count that night, so I went above and beyond: I raided
 the money pot of the `Save the Memphis Armadillo Fund', which also happened
 to be shaped like a huge armadillo and was placed smack in the middle of
 the whole fair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I rarely happen to talk about myself and how great a thief I am, but
 any professional in the business would admit it was a damn hard job to
 pull.
 And they'd also call me `an audacious son of a bitch' or in case their
 vocabulary didn't include the word `audacious', which is more often than
 not the case, `a cheeky bastard'.
 And that would be the right thing to say, because I did it in plain sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a basic technique among social engineers (who in Memphis were still
 known as con-artists), but one that was rarely applicable to the sort of
 jobs that paid off handsomely.
 But when the opportunity or the need for some quick cash arose, and the
 situation allowed for it, robbing people in front of their eyes and acting
 as if it was perfectly alright to do so worked amazingly well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All I had to do was grap myself a Cotton Candy Fair T-shirt stamped with
 the catchy motto `Now y'all have some ribs' and tape a couple of pieces
 of paper on my front and back that read 'STAFF', and presto, I was a bonafide
 fair organiser.
 All I had to then was walk up to the huge armadillo, lift its bottoms,
 reach into its innards and grab the plastic box brimming with some real
 cash, all the while smiling, nodding and waving encouragingly to everyone
 who happened to venture a look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then walked away, and counted the paper money without a care.
 It took some time but there was a hefty sum involved which proved adequate
 enough for what Eileen had in mind; and that was making a large, charitable

And that person would be me.
 Because, naturally, I'm the go-to guy when dealing with demons, evil spirits

 bad for personal hygiene.

 well, rotten.

So I had a quick chat with a cheerful old lady who seemed to be the Country
 Cotton Candy Club's cashier, secretary, president and sole member.
 When I showed her the money, she had a second or two with herself before
 shaking my hand as if her life depended on it and assuring me that Mr.
 Novorski and I could have all the night to ourselves for twenty five thousand
 dollars, which she wasn't loathe to admit was almost as much as the annual
 `Save the Armadillo' fund raised each year more or less.

It kind of felt like buying the sexual services of a business entrepreneur
 who had become a male prostitute purely as part of an ongoing market research
 in an effort to diversify his approach to potential customers, which in
 fact probably meant that he had a very sick hobby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It also felt like whatever money people donated each year, the armadillo
 would still be in need of saving, long past the sun going supernova, and
 perhaps even after the heat-death of the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having set the trap, my end of the job was done.
 All that remained was Novorski's arrival, and then we'd be game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was participating in a belching contest and though I couldn't hear
 from that distance, the applauses and cheers when his turn came were indicative
 of his chance at winning.
 Eileen was also watching albeit from a different angle.
 She shot me a glance and I shrugged knowingly and smiled.
 She shook her head and grinned, and I noticed Steve had just stage-dived,
 still holding his embalmed skunk way up high, as if it were some sort of
 tomahawk, an electric guitar, or a combination of both.

Then we heard from the PA, in that familiar, aggravatingly friendly-sounding

Now y'all put those ribs down, and keep off the hooch jus' a lil' while,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing much happened, and the usual round of applause and perhaps cheers
 did not ensue.
 No-one really seemed to have even acknowledged the announcement, even less
 so the fact that Novorski had just appeared onto the center stage, prominently
 featuring right behind the huge, and by now mostly empty, armadillo.
 That prompted the announcer who had probably been in this kind of a somewhat
 awkward moment to make a suggestion:

\begin_layout Standard
To which suddenly, as if a light bulb had gone off above each person's head,
 the crowd responded with a hefty amount of applause, and a loud cheer.
 Novorski appeared to smile politely but very thinly so.
 I'm no expert on demons, spirits, and the like, but I'm pretty sure these
 sort of events weren't in his job prescription originally, and he loathed
 every minute of it, especially since it appeared like he was supposed to
 play the role of the good samaritan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen was standing with her back on a weeping willow, pretty much covered
 by all the low-stooped branches.
 I could see her features plainly taut with determined fury and a clear
 purpose in mind.
 It was one more reason why I was very relieved to not have her inside my
 mind.
 There was something about the way she clenched and opened her fists continuousl
y that made me believe that just a glimpse of her mind right at that time
 would have felt like a floating balloon does in a shitstorm of monumental
 proportions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve seemed happily enough completely unaware of his surroundings, quite
 drunk and jusging from the very rude body language about to exchange his
 laminated feathery hat for some sexual favours from what appeared to be
 a small group of height-challenged people (I believe in Memphis they're
 still called midgets).
 Now, I don't consider myself one of those judgmental pricks but the value
 for money on that deal seemed horrible, only I couldn't tell which of the
 involved parties was taking advantage of the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as I was concerned, Steve was probably having the time of his life,
 while everything important in my life, mostly the ability to keep breathing,
 hang by a thread.
 One could even say I envied him for being so care-free, seeing as the midgets
 put on his hat and rubbed his belly with cotton seed oil, but they'd be
 wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Novorski's voice through the PA caught my attention, while most of the crowd
 kept on about their usual frolicking and lollygagging, and the midgets
 along with Steve were no exception either.
 I heard him say in that squeaky voice of his that was just as dreadful
 as when I had first met him years ago as Eileen's cotton mogul (filthy
 rich in Memphis terms) father:

 things running along, like she does every, single, year..
 Now, usually you'd hear me say a few things about how important it is to
 remember to support the local cotton industry, which is to say keep buying
 everything related to cotton, and especially that worthless cotton seed
 oil that's only good for gettin' your hands dirty and your rifle clean.

But this time, it's a different year all together, so I'd like to take this
 opportunity to set some things straight.
 First of all, I'm sick of you people.
 Don't worry, I'm not talking about Memphis.
 I'm talking about people, in general.
 I hate that pestering ability of yours to have hope, even when everything's
 going to hell like a fast-freight train.
 Which brings me to the next issue: and that is I'm not who I seem to be
 at all, and it was about god-damn time things got going, but you won't
 really mind about that, I've seen to it.
 Last but not least, Eileen, or whatever you call yourself now, you're in
 for a shitload of pain, honey.
 'Cause you've been a naughty girl and daddy's real pissed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those last few words in the wrong context could have been interpreted in
 a slightly perverted way, but when taken face value they kinda got me thinking
 that plans A and B were both painfully inadequate to deal with Novorski,
 who seemed aware we were going to be there from the start.
 And instead of bidding his time, he just literally sprouted wings, grew
 horns and fangs, a barbed tail, as well as an array of the assorted nasty
 features usually associated with demons, beelzebubs, balrogs and the armies
 of hell as portrayed in popular religious fiction.
 He had turned into the physical form of the demon he really was, and I
 wasn't sure we could just burn him now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a bit of a laugh actually, realising that all those quaint depictions
 of evil demons were actually true, but it wasn't as funny when that demon
 stood twelve feet tall, with an impossibly inhuman but overly developed
 physique, the stink of rotten eggs and stale blood emanating from him reaching
 hundreds of feet away, and a very real, shiny, and quite sharp-looking
 set of serrated bone claws of the sort that make visceral death a most
 literal notion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen did not shy away though and stood her ground, looking at the demon
 with a piercing set of glittering eyes.
 That meant she wasn't about to start running which would have been my primary,
 secondary, and tertiary choice (and all subsequent choices, rest assured).
 She seemed to be grinning, like letting everyone know she was ready to
 put up a fight right then and there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That didn't resonate all too well with me, especially seeing that Novorski
 had turned into a demonic creature weighing probably half a ton, and the
 ability to kill with a mere slap in the back.
 Not to mention its breath, which was in urgent need of some mentos (or
 any other freshmaker, take your pick, I'm not splitting hairs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wanted to help, sure, but I wasn't pretty sure about what I could actually
 do against something profoundly irrational and monstrous like Novorski,
 other than bleed profusely in the off chance that he might slip on my own
 pool of blood, fall on its back, and provide a mildly comedic intermission
 to the real fight.
 Because there was bount to be a real fight, and there would be blood.
 It felt like Mama Adele all over again, the difference being I felt we
 were slightly mismatched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially since the crowds kept looking at the demon positively bedazzled,
 mostly pointing at him without realising what it was they were seeing and
 quite possibly thinking this was some sort of special event organized by
 the Memphis Association of Special Effects, which sadly in fact consisted
 of a twelve-year old boy with a penchant for vampire flicks and half a
 pint of raspberry syrup in his mom's fridge which happened to look a bit
 like fake blood, if one looked at it from the right angle, and under the
 right light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No-one started to run, scream and shout, or alternatively fall on their
 knees, pray in despair for deliverance or grovel and offer virgins as sacrifice
, both practices being equally probable in succeeding.
 In fact, I think that the `Married my cousin' and `Marty the Memphis Midget
 is a Mean Mother-you-know-the-rest' events were still going on unabated,
 judging by the sheer number of beer cans thrown at Novorski-in-demon-form
 from their respective spots, protesting for Novorski ruining the party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve did more than just bat an eye-lid when he saw the demon.
 He instantly dropped the beer can he had strapped on his back, threw away
 the dick-shaped carrot and T-string, and rushed over me, skunk still in
 hand, while Novorski erupted into an evil uproar of demonic proportions
 that frankly sounded like someone facing severe stomach trouble.
 I was idly watching the crowd silently and almost on cue part in half and
 create a wide path, as Novorski jumped off stage, scaring the - still -
 living shit out of everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marty the Midget could be heard, shouting on his own `Think ya tough? Huh?
 I'm the Memphis Mean Motherfucker, motherfucker!', followed by shocked
 gasps from the majority of church-goers who had attended the show in an
 effort to fight profanity and evil in all its forms, but were somehow still
 undaunted and even indifferent to the demonic monstrosity that fumed sulfur
 and sported ember hot eyes that seemed able to peel one's skin by their
 mere gaze.
 Perhaps it was because the demon wasn't wearing the customary informative
 T-shirt based on a tune, like `Am I evil? Yes I Am', `This is the Road
 to Hell', or `Hell ain't a bad place to be'.
 Perhaps it was just the fact that these people seemed to act like mind-wiped
 idiots.
 Eileen then shouted something that attracted my attention:

 similar to drawing.
 His movements and disposition were clear, precise, purposeful.

 I couldn't help asking him:

 he said, hurriedly scribbling all sorts of jibberish and weird geometric
 shapes that frankly looked a lot like something I was fairly certain he
 had ripped off from Rosemary's Baby.
 I thought this was a really bad time for being so nostalgic about a film
 by Polanski.
 Eileen interrupted my train of thought with a regal shout, her feet barely
 touching the ground as she started levitating towards Novorski with a slow,
 deliberate pace:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
I would have protested that these folks had very little in the way of brains,
 ergo minds to poison in the first place, but that thought somehow became
 something quite irrelevant when I realised Eileen had tasked Steve with
 protecting

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That did in fact sound somewhat prestigious and certainly made me look like
 a really important person like all those famous folks who can't take a
 leak without someone watching over them in case something bad happens to
 them, say like a pot plant falling on their heads from a high balcony,
 or a group of bullets with the intention of using the famous folks as handy
 inertial dampeners (in Memphis they call that stopping a bullet).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That meant Eileen thought I was some kind of target.
 And that made me highly uncomfortable, and as was usually the case that
 sort of thing tended to kick off my run and hide instincts, perhaps the
 single most useful of the traits passed on from our human hunter-gatherer
 ancestors (that and the tendency to proliferate sexually - which in Memphis
 was still called porkin').

 I said with the slightest hint of hope to Steve, who had just finished
 a rough sort of circle on the ground and we were standing smack right in
 the center of it.
 Steve looked at me and replied in a very strange way which I didn't expect
 or liked at all because it involved

 Do you understand?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I nodded my understanding in a perfectly clear fashion that made my neck
 hurt, and was determined to follow Steve's advice.
 Even if every inch of my body wanted to start running on its own, in various
 mutually exclusively directions, at record-breaking speeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My fear was only strengthened when I saw Novorski purposefully stride towards
 Eileen, who was silently slightly bobbing up and down in mid-air, radiating
 a bluish neon light from her skin, as if she'd just come back from a really
 hardcore rave party where shooting paint 
\shape italic

 instead of just dabbing it on skin was the norm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crowd was cheering and yelling boos at the same time, in anticipation
 of what they perceived to be some sort of UFC match-up the likes of which
 they had never even thought possible, not very much unlike what a real
 fight between Mothma and Godzilla would've looked like to a Japanese crowd:
 Unreal, yet so cool you couldn't resist touching it even if it meant losing
 a finger to frostbite.
 They were stupefied, fatally attracted, and grossly mislead alltogether:
 they threw ripe tomatoes at Eileen who seemed to be putting a lot of effort
 into resisting the urge to adopt a more vengeful attitude towards bystanders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Novorski on the other hand had already tramped on a couple of folks unlucky
 enough to ask for his autograph.
 He was casually whipping his tail around as if it were some kind of pet
 making other suffer from its ADHD, and making gestures suggesting lewd
 activities that seemed to involve his bifurbicated tongue and - thankfully
 - asexual pelvis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As some sort of invisible clock ticked away and everyone seemed to be attuned
 to the dispositions of its hands, I saw Steve had closed his eyes and was
 repeating the same thing, over and over:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That kind of self-assurance led me to believe that Steve might have been
 the wrong person to assure my safety from this demon or any other threat
 that involved something more dangerous than a cake fight.
 My attention was drawn to what sounded like badly-greased chainsaws throttling
 away at a junk yard:

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gruntled the demon, who grinned with all the malevolence usually associated
 with his kind, showing off a couple of tusks that shone sharp like razors.
 Eileen's response was immaculately well-thought, original and appropriate
 for a spirit of her stature:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Eat shit and die,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 she said with a calmness that belied her strength, raised a hand, and out
 of the clear night sky without a cloud in sight I saw lightning strike
 at the feet of the demon, with a blinding flash of light and then a sound
 of cracking air followed by the deep rumbling echo of mountains crashing
 into the sea that made me think the world was coming apart at the seams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an astonishing show of sheer power and command over nature, an unparallel
ed tour-de-force that made Eileen look like a heathen goddess of yore, powerful
 and unforgiving, smiting folks all day long for no apparent reason and
 them thanking her for it as well.
 Too bad it didn't actually do anything to Novorski, who appeared to be
 unscathed through the little wisp of smoke the thunder had left behind.
 The smile on his grotesque, demonic face had a gleaming quality about it,
 which implied he was enjoying this immensely.
 His voice was sticky like tar from a hell-pit:

 he said and with the speed of world-class sprinter jumping the gun he flung
 himself towards Eileen with just one flap of his wings and a giant leap,
 his arms outsretched and taut, ready to clench her in a swoop of his claws
 that would leave little to be imagined about what guardian spirit hosts
 looked like on the inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His ferocity was abundantly evident; his supernatural physique left no doubt
 about the extend of his strength, speed, and agility.
 He was a demonic machine, bred for bloodletting, destruction and chaos,
 indeed designed to wreak havoc on human flesh.
 But there's always flaws in a design, and that fact was remarkably pointed
 out when Eileen arched her back all the way, hands touching the ground,
 exactly the moment the demons' claws sweeped at nothing but air, and then
 sidestepped him by rolling to the side, avoiding his kicking legs and tail
 with a motion so graceful and regally syncopated, it reminded me of a cross
 between Grace Kelly and Nacho Vidal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the demon flew past Eileen without being able to hide his aggravation
 and surprise.
 He managed to bring himself to a stop after a few yards, and I made the
 mental note that somehow these things were limited by physical laws as
 much men as the rest of us.
 Which was probably a good thing, as long as they were somehow persuaded
 to fall from tall cliffs and onto jarred, sharp rocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve still hadn't opened his eyes, but he had at least stopped reminding
 me that we the circle around us with all the cursive writing and the weird
 sex symbols was just a circle and nothing more, and the only thing that
 stood between us and that thing was Eileen.
 He did ask though:

 Steve told me with acute worry in his voice, and the fact that he was wearing

 I asked in vain but did not bother to wait for an answer or to press the

 What was going on in the background, behind the approaching throng of Memphis
 folks turned zombie demon thralls, as far as I could tell, was pure mayhem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though I didn't have a clear view, I could see fireballs the size of car
 shooting up in the night sky.
 Some of the fireballs the size of a car where actually flaming cars, but
 that was just a pedantic difference.
 I also saw lots of lightning, sheets of hail and spikes of ice, flying
 blocks of stone, as well as giant swirls of water raised from the river
 and hurled at Novorski.
 They were swooping, and tilting and turning in the air, with Novorski trying
 to get his claws on Eileen, while she kept pounding at him with everything
 nature could provide.
 Except fire which seemed to be kind of a second home to the demon, seeing
 as he writhed in red hot and yellow-white flames.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve tugged at my jeans at a really inappropriate place, and I thought
 that being gay and perhaps about to die was in no way a valid reason to
 try and fondle my private parts.
 I saw that he was just reaching for me blind, keeping his eyes shut, but
 mysteriously saying nothing:

 my eyes and listened.

\begin_layout Standard
And all I could hear was shuffling summer flip-flops across the Memphis
 soggy riverside ground, interminably coming closer and closer, their feet
 meandering at the edge of the circle, their hands outstretched, and quite
 possibly hungering for brains, or other vital parts.
 In a rare fit of actually thinking about how things could be worse, I imagined
 that maybe there existed such a thing as a gay zombie.
 I didn't dare think about that further.
 I simply said to Steve with a wavering voice:

 I couldn't hear any choppers, but after a moment or two, above the snarling
 throaty sounds of the mindless Memphis denizens that encircled us, I could
 hear the unmistakable of sound of Wagner's Die Valkyrie, and I suddenly
 smiled and thought that all this was just a very elaborate film set.

I kind of dismissed that idea when the corn started falling from the sky,
 horns and other brass instruments blaring in epic fashion.

Thick pellets of corn started shooting out of the sky in wide jets, as if
 someone was throwing it at us through large hoses.
 I instantly caught a whiff of garlic, and saw the gathered zombies unable
 to resist themselves, and opening up their mouths to gulp down as much
 of it as they could, like a water-starved man does when it finally rains.

In the background I could see the demon looking surprised, even apprehensive,
 trying to fly away from Eileen instead of trying to cut her into little
 pieces like earlier.
 It was as if he was thinking what was happening was bad for him, and he
 was trying to escape.
 I couldn't make a possible connection, until one of the zombies grabbed
 me by the shoulder and asked me:

Hey ol' buddy? Mind if get that laddle back? Kinda need it to stir the stew,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, sure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I replied, completely flabbergasted while Steve started yelling right in
 my ear:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

It's them! Woo!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Who the fuck's them anyway and why is corn falling out of the sky? And for
 fuck's sake, why Wagner?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I asked, feeling quite irate and definitely believing that some kind of
 explanation, however illogical or impossible was in order.
 And as the crowd of former zombies dispersed pretty much in the same way
 as it had been formed, returning to whatever they had been doing before
 they were turned into hopefully unwilling minions, I watched as Eileen
 was nowhere to be seen, and Novorski had vanished as well, leaving nothing
 but flaming debris and the occasional cinder of a tree, which weren't that
 unusual for a Memphis riverside fair on a summer night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My question wasn't left unanswered for too long, since I suddenly saw the
 demon form of Novorski being shot through with a couple of harpoon-like
 sharp things, from which a run of cables seemed to disappear into the night.
 Not a moment later, the harpoons and the cables flashed electric blue and
 seemed to sizzle hotter than a melting pot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like I had noticed earlier, demons seemed unable to escape the laws of physics,
 so this one was dropping down fast.
 The Wagner music was no more when I heard a splash and then the usual hubbub
 of the crowd which as always, seemed happily oblivious to absolutely everything
 that had happened, apart from the fact that Marty the Midget had peed his
 pants, for no apparent reason, and from what I could hear that stirred
 up some pretty heated debates on whether or not that was legal in the state
 of Tennessee.
 Still, there was no sign of Eileen, and that was kind of unsettling.
 After all, I was only almost knee-deep in corn because I needed her to
 help me save my ass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve suddenly cried and pointed to the sky right above us, while I felt
 the gentle rush of a downwind ruffle my hair:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Them, man! The Bureau!

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Feds? But how? I mean..
 I'm a dead man,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I said mostly to myself, believing that pretty soon I'd be in custody for
 felonies committed in fifty-one states (counting the job in Puerto Rico).
 Once processed and in a federal prison, my life would end abruptly at the
 hands of one of Falconi's men.
 There was no point in running from people who could turn zombies back into
 regular people by shooting corn at them.
 Then Steve managed to make me slightly more likely to punch him for mixing
 thing up:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Not the feds, man! The Bureau! Look!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said and sounded positively thrilled about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The downwind grew into a real gale, and the stands around us fell over,
 and some were even carried away, while the few folks who had been sitting
 behind them, just kept on pretending everything was in place, while I could
 now feel hot air trying to strip most of my facial features off my face.
 I could barely open my eyes but I could still see Steve had done a hell
 of a job with his teeth, as a constant turbulent flow of hot air was shot
 on his wide grinning face, his teeth clenched as if glued together and
 the skin around the mouth fluttering away as if someone was trying to slice
 jello with a jackhammer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then I saw it with my own eyes, and while still unable to explain most of
 it, the idea that this was actually an elaborate movie set popped back
 into my mind as the hull of a large blimp became visible as it had just
 touched the ground, with what resembled a quad of tilting engines coming
 to rest in an upright position.
 It looked a lot like the Goodyear blimp, only beefed up, painted jet black,
 and giving off an aura of being indestructible, even though the damn thing
 would probably fall right off the sky if a bird with a really pointy beak
 decided it had issues with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve was looking relieved, calm, and beaming with enthusiasm.
 He reminded me of someone who has just had great sex with some twins, followed
 by a Cuban cigar, a glass of Hennessey, and couldn't wait for the Baywatch
 rerun to start on TV.
 Then the blimp's cupola door swung open and I saw this tall black fellow
 pop out, dressed in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, wearing a pair
 of black glasses coming my way, hands easily visible, his posture cool,
 and calm, business-like and natural.
 I was about to ask what the hell this was all about and who the hell these
 people were, when I saw Steve smile like this was a Kodak moment of pure
 gold.
 Then I heard him say just a few dozen feet away from that black-suited
 guy, pointing at him with a cheesy-looking hand in the shape of a gun,
 grin as wide as the Panama canal:

The black man in the suit stopped abruptly, and didn't look particularly
 happy, and definitely not as happy as Steve.
 In fact he looked like he had been offended somehow, kind of like someone
 had called his mother an ugly unscrupulous sex worker.
 He shot Steve a look that said `don't go there', while he actually said:

\begin_layout Standard
I saw the white of his eyes bristle, as if it somehow shone with his furious
 anger.
 I think I cleared my throat before deciding to speak, which was the perfectly
 wrong thing to do at that exact point:

\begin_layout Standard
Steve saw the man he had called Jules smiled and seemed to mellow a bit,
 and took the opportunity to try and set things straight, perhaps making
 some sense out of all this in the process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 he roared suddenly, pointing the hefty-looking silver-finished Magnum at
 Steve, who subsequently went silent at once and seemed content to just
 listen.
 The man in the suit then seemed to relax a bit.
 He smiled at me, took my limp hand and shook it saying:

 he said as he led the way towards the blimp, while I kept pace by his side,
 having given up on my distrustful instincts and eagerly embraced the philosophy
 best summed up in the phrase `got nothing to lose'.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within moments, we were ushered first inside the blimp.
 It didn't look much different than a trailer to be honest, and there were
 these other guys also in black-suits who motioned us to sit down in two
 - comfy I'll admit - chairs.
 They wore the most expressionless faces I had ever seen, and I half expected
 them to start doing those pre-flight emergency presentations, wearing life-jack
ets and showing us how to use an oxygen mask.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they just sat there like immovable objects, parts of the decoration,
 rigid and stone-like.
 Until Jules got on-board and saw them one of them erupt in stomach killing
 laughter of the kind one cannot voluntarily stop, and soon the other guy
 followed suit.
 Jules just looked at them disapprovingly, shook his head and said:
\end_layout

 one of the suits said and pointed at me, while the other was still trying
 to stop laughing like a maniac high on laughing gas.

\begin_layout Standard

And you got a bet on it as well? Who's going to crack first or some shit?

 asked Jules with just the right hint of anger-buildup in his voice.

Like always, man.
 The standard fifty,

 he said, gloating, chewing gum and looking like someone very difficult
 to genuinely like no matter how many times you went fishing with.
 Jules seemed to like-minded when he said, tapping that guy's chest:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I can make life so difficult for you in the Bureau, you'd be wishing you'd
 pursued a carreer as bait for schools of piranhas in the Amazon, or perhaps
 a target in a shooting range the size of a phone booth.
 Now you shut it, both of you.
 And start flying.
 Did I make myself clear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, sir,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the not-so-funny-now-looking guy said and proceeded through a door to what
 must've been the cockpit, while the other guy had finally managed to contain
 his laughter and closed the door.
 Within moments, we were lifting off the ground, and Jules asked me, while
 eye-balling Steve in a threatening way that perhaps involved non-consensual
 sex:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Can I get you anything? Some refreshment, a

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to say I was fine, when after finally having sat down and being
 able to just let someone else do something for a change, I heard my stomach
 rumble violently, and realised I hadn't eaten anything since that morning,
 and that didn't even count as a real breakfast humans eat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there were are other pressing matters my mind should've been
 occupied with, like `Who were these guys? Was Steve working with them?
 Why? Where was Eileen? Where they telling me the truth? Was this some kind
 of trap? What did they want of me? What's with the black glasses at night?'.
 But it completely disregarded those and filed them under `interesting but
 not pressing', and instead concerned on getting something to eat.
 So I said to Jules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Is there something like a ham and cheese sandwich?

Mayo, mustard or ketchup?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I settled for some mayo, and when Jules disappeared to some sort of small
 kitchen, Steve said in a low whisper with an excitement that prompted me
 to check whether or not he had peed his pants:
\end_layout

Man, you don't know what an honor that is!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I did in fact have no knowledge of the honor involved, I was perfectly
 satisfied with enjoying the sandwich itself when Jules returned with it.
 I hadn't even realised but a fleeting look outside a small window amazed
 me, just as it had been promised: we were flying so fast I could see the
 lights on the ground below zip past like this was just another freeway,
 eating away at distance like it was peanuts.
 I was interrupted by Jules who pulled a chair from a little utilitarian
 table, sat across me and said:
