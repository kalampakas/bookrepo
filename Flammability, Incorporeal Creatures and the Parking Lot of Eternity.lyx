Flammability, Incorporeal Creatures and the Parking Lot of Eternity

\begin_layout Standard
John was the best I'd ever seen with a blowtorch.
 He wielded it like Da Vinci wielded a god-damn paintbrush.
 He could do things with it that in many places were certainly illegal and
 definitely deranged, with the possible exception of Japan and/or Australia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was this thing about John and the blue-hot propane flames that bordered
 - nay, even surpassed - the realm of wonder.
 If Jesus could come down and visit from Heaven and work with a blowtorch
 next to John, he'd look like a pyromaniac hobo with a messiah complex and
 a background in carpentry, while John would just shine with a bright white
 light from within, turn water into beer and beer into piss with just a

 John was just

that

 good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it was a fucking bummer when I learned that his last words actually were:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Don't be a pussy, oxygen tanks do that hissing sound all the time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as classifying bummers goes, this was a triple-A class bummer, the
 kind of showstopper that had only been theorised up to John's untimely
 and gruesome death.
 The kind of bummer that could make Jim Carey's face flat and emotionless
 and Bill Clinton sworn to celibacy.
 It ranked way far above the A-plus bummer of being recently divorced, fired,
 being fired upon and being set on fire at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which was bad in and of itself, but not as bad as John getting blown up
 a day before the Job.
 That was a sad state of affairs that meant I was now a very sorry son of
 a bitch with a life expectancy that made the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

lifetime warranty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sound like a tasteless practical joke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here I was, melting away in a decrepit diner on route 72, at a swampy
 nowhere with some supposedly native american though actually gibberish
 name like 'Alatanoosa' or 'Whahananoka', someplace between Alabama and
 Tenessee.
 The coffee tasted like imported dirt, the kind of dirt you read about being
 very fashionable and exaggeratedly overpriced but at the end of the day,
 was just dirt.
 The fried eggs looked like fried eggs, but only in the most rudimentary
 way: there was an orange bit with some white plastic all around it.
 I guess my flair for adventure was wearing out so it just sat there, where
 I happily failed to ingest it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I really didn't feel like eating at all.
 Maybe it was the god-damn heat, the stale humid air and the fact that about
 the same time tomorrow, I would be probably looking at the wrong end of
 more than a couple of gun barrels because I had promised something I couldn't
 deliver to some very single-minded people with a propensity for shooting,
 rather than having coffee and biscuits and sympathizing with the bad card
 life dealt you.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason I couldn't deliver was I couldn't do the Job.
 And I couldn't do the Job without John, because John, the flamboyant blowtorch
 virtuoso with an unmatched record of ninety-two safes, safe-rooms, and
 bank vaults, an average time of three point three minutes, clean as a germ-obse
ssed placebo-munching single old lady right before kidney stone surgery
 and a no-smoking-on-the-job policy that kept my cigarette budget intact,
 had gone and killed himself in his brother's-in-law chop shop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I stopped and asked myself at that point whether that unfortunate death,
 at such a bad time, right before what would now prove to be the last gig
 in my career was a sign from God to stop doing what I did best: stealing.
 In a rare know-thyself moment I reminded myself I wasn't half as good at
 it as some Wall Street people, politicians and the let-me-lend-you-your-own-mon
ey cutthroats that roamed the street unabashed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Logic would then imply that if there was going to be any smiting and all
 that holier-than-thou business, any God with a sense of perspective, morality
 and justice wouldn't start dishing it out on my end.
 And in any case, I decided that if God really had something to tell me,
 he'd better make a really really good point with lots of compelling arguments,
 like saving my ass pronto.
 Or at least point me to a direction, show me the road to salvation that
 preferably led somewhere warm and sandy in the Pacific, along with a couple
 of Cayman bank accounts, some instantly gratifying plastic surgery and
 twelve hundred different driving licenses.
 I'd have thought about asking for another favor but they said that size
 didn't matter, bank accounts' notwithstanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Realising how God and reality rarely intertwined, I felt some kind of emotional
 pressure the likes of which I hadn't experienced since high-school and
 all the awkward parties.
 A stress relief mechanism kicked in someplace inside me and I sighed deeply
 before shouting out an expletive, something eloquent like 'Fuck!'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That made some heads in the diner turn and raised the attached eyebrows
 apprehensively.
 It also gained me the attention of the establishment's chef- du-cuisine,
 a six-foot-three, two-hundred and fifty pound red-haired, bush-bearded
 wild-eyed man-like Alabama creature with a meat cleaver, a stained apron
 and a murderous gleam in his eye.
 He pointed that cleaver towards my direction and said with a slight snarl

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I nodded faintly and muttered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm sorry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in an absent-minded fashion before I put ten bucks on the table, got up
 and left.
 He probably felt that'd given me a good old fashioned run-down, but I was
 simply in a hurry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I looked at my watch, one of the few items I had actually bought with honest
 money from a winning lottery ticket back when I kept saying to myself that
 heists were 'a temporary thing'.
 It was half past ten in the morning, and I had more or less twenty two
 and a half hours to live.
 As I looked at the bland green and brown Southern scenery, I noticed a
 couple of dogs humping without a care in the world, oblivious to pretty
 much everything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to think something profound about nature and the will of life
 to survive and continue, when I noticed they both had 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stuff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dangling underneath.
 Even nature had a way of giving me the finger.
 I looked up into the blighting sun and all I could see was white and red
 dots for the next ten minutes.
 I'd left my glasses inside the diner.
 I said to myself, fuck that, I don't need sunglasses.
 I'm Bobby.
 I'm going to do what it takes, and I sure as hell can do it without sunglasses.
 In retrospect, that might have been a mistake cause those sunglasses had
 a history of their own, but it was time for action not remembrance.
 So I acted on impulse, without pausing to ruminate on the outcome of my
 actions, and especially what those actions might incur precipitate in relation
 to my person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, thinking back to that particular moment in time, the moment I decided
 to act was the moment I kept thinking to myself 'Bobby, that doesn't mean
 shit.
 John blowing up doesn't mean shit.
 You can still do this.
 You can still get rich, or die trying', that must have been the moment
 that would probably get the most votes in the 'Most Regrettable Moment
 in Your Entire Life' category.
 It would also get lots of points in the 'Shit I Wish I Hadn't Done' category,
 but the real winner in that one was calling up Eileen.
 I'd done mistakes before, but it always amazed me how impossibly fast I
 regretted calling Eileen on that particular day.
 I panicked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I rang her three times before she picked up.
 When she did, it sounded like she hadn't talked to a real person in about
 three years:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mmbby? Mmmby Baahow? My Bobby Bear?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I took little notice that she had been stuffing herself, probably a bad
 case of munchies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, Eileen,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 managing to keep my tone of voice even, normal.
 It really felt like biting the bullet when I said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it's me, Papa-Bear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It also made me cringe as the connotations that old term of endearment
 implied flashed across my mind's eye.
 Jesus Christ, not Eileen.
 What was I doing? Was there no other way? Was this a possible way out or
 was it just a faster way under?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Awwww, Papa-Bear..
 Is, this really you Bobby? I miss you so much, you know.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She sounded quite sincere but then again crazy people always do since they
 do believe you are actually an ursine humanoid, complete with fur, claws,
 a fluffy tummy, and an unhealthy hunger for honey and Taco Bell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Right, Eileen.
 That's, me..
 Yeah.
 Papa-waka-bear.
 Huh..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The words seemed to be drip-fed to my brain from some sort of mental black
 hole that spewed forth nothing that made sense.
 Fortunately that strongly resonated with Eileen's sense of reality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, Papa-waka-bear, so strong and furry and manly..With lots and lots of furry
 shouldery hair for me to rub and that sweet tummy..Can I see you Bobby? Just
 this once, I won't be a bother, really.
 We don't need to go boat-pedaling or skating.
 Just see you, maybe let me rub your tummy.
 And have sex?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I closed my eyes and recalled a picture from the past: myself laden with
 honey from tip to toe, tied to a bed with a Winnie the Pooh plushie wearing
 a strap-on dildo and Eileen shouting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rawr! I'm your honeycomb slice, Papa-Bear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I decided then and there that I'd have to appeal to whatever core of sanity
 remained in her mind, or else I could just go drown myself in a really
 shallow body of water, like, say, a gutter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Listen, Eileen..
 We can't..
 I can't do all that, okay? I wish I could, but..
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was a lie.
 That was a lie.
 That was a lie.
 I was lying to her, but that's okay cause she's crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ohh.
 Why can't you Papa-Bear? We could have so much fun together! We could ride
 the tram around the city, and I could feed you cotton candy and berries.
 Like last time, don't you remember? Didn't you have fun? Please, Bobby.
 Can't I see you once more? Why did you call me then? Do you really want
 to hurt me, Bobby?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her voice reminded me uncannily of Boy George and that made my eyes hurt
 just by thinking about it.
 I felt my stomach knot at the thought of all the things I would have to
 endure to get on her good side.
 Or it might have been the coffee-like dirt-brew.
 I took a deep breath before uttering the words as if they were my last:
\end_layout

I need to see you Eileen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Oh, Bobby! You really can't tell how happy that makes me! I feel like leaping
 outside the window and flying to your arms, Papa-Bear!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh God, shit no.
 She was crazy enough to actually pop out the window and crack her head
 open on the street below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no, Eileen! Don't do that honey, no.
 You gotta wait a couple of hours, I'll drop by your place.
 Okay?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No, no! Just sit tight, will ya? I'll bring you chocolate chip cookies,
 your favorite.
 Just don't go anywhere.
 And Eileen, take your meds, please.
 You're still on meds, right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, you mean those horrible pills? They were so bitter and bad for me, unlike
 you Bobby.
 No, no, daddy paid off the bad men in white and now I'm home again.
 Free as a bird.
 Your little nightingale.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was probably wrong.
 No meds, rampant insanity mixed with nymphomaniac tendencies.
 And ursine fantasies.
 For a moment I thought it'd be a better bet to just reason with Falconi,
 but the fact that the last guy who tried that ended up as hand-made soap
 bars with Falconi's signature on it left me with little doubt about where
 my chances lay.
 I'd stick with the looney.
 At least she seemed to still have this thing for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okaaay, Eileen.
 Now, see Papa-Bear's in trouble and I need your help.
 So, make sure you can get a hold of daddy and tell him that you might need
 that jet of his for a trip.
 And some pocket money too.
 Tell him you're going shopping in New York, okay?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I listened myself saying all that and momentarily asked myself 'Are you
 a bad person for doing this, Bobby?', and then the answer came guilt-free
 'No, Falconi is a bad person because he wants you dead for something you
 didn't even do'.
 It also helped to think of myself as Papa-Bear and not Bobby Barhoe.
\end_layout

We're going shopping? Oh, Papa-Bear I always knew you were so much fun!

\begin_layout Standard
I hesitated just for the tiniest moment and I could almost picture the sad,
 watery eyes and then the coming onslaught of cries, curses and finely sharpened
 blades being hurled against me, so I made something like a smooching sound.
 It might have sounded like a fart, I'm not sure, but she sounded positively
 satisfied:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I love you Papa-Bear! I can't wait to snuggly-wuggly you in my arms and

Goodbye!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hang up in the nick of time.
 The ordeal was over for now, but doubts started assaulting me like journalists
 outside a rehab facility for famous people.
 Was this my only option? Would she come through? What if she had been waiting
 for that call, that one call that I might have given her in such a time
 of extenuating circumstances and dire need, just so I could come running
 to her for help and then dice me up because I shot the best-man on our
 wedding day and ran off in her father's Porsche?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had to keep reminding myself I wasn't the bad person here, even as I strode
 back into my piece-of-shit Taurus.
 These were desperate times, and they obviously required insanely desperate
 measures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got back on route 72, heading for Memphis.
 While the radio waves reeked with country, bluegrass and heart-felt messages
 to the parishioners to pledge their support to the Church of Latter Day
 Saints With Semi-Automatic Rifles, I casually gazed outside the window
 and couldn't help notice that this countryside was so flat and uninteresting
 that if there was some kind of hell waiting for everyone, this would be
 it.
 I was about to start a self-gratifying rant, using phrases like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Good job right there, Bobby
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sure I can vouch for that sleezeball Mr.
 Falconi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Heck no, nothing can go wrong, we're all pros here.
 Right?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when a big brown legged thing just popped right in front of the Taurus.
 I applied pressure to the braking pedal and then the laws of physics worked
 their magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, despite appearances I'm a fairly well-educated man and I know that
 Taurus is just a fancy word for bull.
 I also know that for a car to decelerate from eighty miles-per-hour to
 zero, it takes a couple hundred feet, and that's because no-one in his
 right mind would design a car that could turn its occupants into mush or
 tarmac jelly (depending on the seat belt arrangement) when they wanted
 it to stop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, I wasn't really suprised when the Taurus hit that horse.
 I wasn't really surprised when the airbag tried to rob me of what looked
 like my early dying breath.
 Surprise wasn't achieved even when the car swiveled and landed sideways
 in a gravely ditch.
 It wasn't the fact that I was still in one piece, nor the fact that the
 horse - had it been given the oral faculty post-mortem - could not say
 the same for itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the shaman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There I was, still trying to decide whether or not I was still alive and
 with my brain between my ears, when I saw through the hazy smoke and vapor
 of the smashed front of the car the figure of a lone man, looking directly
 at me with a deeply sombre gaze, as if I had just killed his horse.
 He was dressed in a brown leather jacket, criss-crossed leather vest, and
 soft tan shoes.
 I'd have wagered he was some kind of a disco enthusiast with a slightly
 bent sexual orientation, if it wasn't for the feathery hat and the somewhat
 austere, manly jaw line.
 He was the spitting image of some Cherokee.
 Or Navajo.
 I didn't know, I just knew they name cars after these kinds of people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He spoke with a peculiar voice that had the impossible qualities of gravel
 and running water at the same time:
\end_layout

Are you hurt?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would normally have taken the time to think about faking some injury so
 I could sue the guy for damages.
 But under the circumstances, namely that if everything went according to
 plan I had less than a day to live combined with that this guy's entire
 estate most probably consisted of a dead horse, a tipi and his grandparents
 in a convenient ash form, I instinctively opted for the truth.
 Everything felt connected to the proper slots and I literaly (and sadly,
 figuratively as well) saw no great blinding light at the end of a tunnel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He came closer, shook open my jammed door and helped me get out of the car.
 He striked me as neither too old and neither too young, kind of exactly
 like Ronn Moss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yeah, I think I'm okay.
 Where did you, ahm..
 I mean, the horse just popped out of nowhere, and..
\begin_inset Quotes erd

I know, Bobby.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His words had a strangely calming effect.
 They oozed serenity.
 It was like listening to the voice of a loving grandfather, and by loving
 I don't mean pedophile.
 But then it hit me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How did he know my name?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What did he mean by saying 'I know'? What did he know? I looked blankly
 at him, wondering briefly if I there was a universal balance being observed
 right at that moment.
 My impending doom, and a horse dying in front of Taurus.
 Could it be that somehow the cosmic forces of life contrived to tell me
 something? Had some sort of karmic exchange taken place right in front
 of my eyes? A horse's life, for my own? An offering, a sacrifice to the
 powers beyond reach? Was he a holy man? Some sort of shaman? An emissary
 of fate? Was this the break I so desperately needed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How did he know my name?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His next words jarred me out of my shocked reverie:

I felt a bit silly, standing right beside him on the side of the road, bending
 over looking at what must have been horse gut sprayed all over what at
 some point, had been my Taurus' radiator.
\end_layout

I'm sorry, I must've been thinking out loud.
 Well, yeah.
 Bobby Barhoe.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked at me sideways, somehow failing to mask his feelings disappointment.
 I couldn't know if it was my name or the pool of blood oozing from the
 horse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What kind of a name is that, Barhoe? Seriously?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was an odd think to ask, but then again I'd just run over his horse so
 I felt I should indulge the man.
 It might have also been an unconscious, fool-hardy effort to steer the
 discussion away from the dead horse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I've never really given it much thought.
 It's just a name, really.
 I actually think it sounds sturdy, homely.

He furrowed his left eyebrow in a grimace that would have normally required
 a monocle for full effect.
 I took a closer look at the steaming pile of heap that used to be the engine

 You're not a gun-crazed ape so you can't deal with Falconi going in, guns

 You are the careful, studied planner who has taken everything into consideratio

 You can't just pretent to do the job and get caught because then Falconi

 You can't find a replacement - no less in such a short notice - because

The truck driver's name was Ivan Kerrilov, and when he spoke he never failed

With safety in mind first and without taking his eyes off the road, Ivan
 took his hand off the wheel and made two little figures with his fingers
 that first walked casually next to each other, and then one seemed to bend
 over only to get the index finger of the other hand repeatedly inserted
 into an imaginary cavity.
 At first I squinted at the little charade, trying to think what could be
 going on in Ivan's stranger-fiction-mind.
 And then I saw his leery smile and rhythmical movement of his pelvis I
 irreversibly knew he was asking whether or not me and Steve were a 'thing'.
 I answered as delicately as appearances and circumstances allowed:

 asked Steve without provocation and without a care, delving deep into the

A really big truck with a streamlined design overtook us on the left, blaring
 his horn all the way.
 At the end of the huge tank he was carrying, the driver had put up a neon
 sign that said 'HONK IF YOU'RE HUNG LIKE AN ARMADILLO'.
 Before my brain had time to fully explore the possibilities that such a
 statement entailed and what it really meant (for instance, what is an armadillo
 hung like? is it hung like an anteater or other thing beginning with 'a'?),
 I was reflexively covering up my ears because Ivan had just honked, laughing
 like an immigrant version of the Woodpecker.
 On the other hand I noticed Steve was browsing through the mini-bar, which
 invariably seemed to possess enough alchohol to fire up an amateur rocket.
 Most of the tiny bottles were empty and the rest of them was emptied around
 the driver's seat.

 A split second later Steve thought it was time for some kind of psychological
 evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

See now that's typical behavior of repressed sexuality.
 You have a problem opening up to society as a homosexual man, so you become
 defensive, try to look like the dominating male figure, while in fact you
 subconsciously hitched a hike with an outspokenly gay man - in a milk truck
 no less - and just a moment ago admitted you're worse at sucking cock than
 most women.
 And that's why you punched me, because in this soul-searching quest you
 are too confined by your own-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I punched him again, and this time it had the desired effect.
 He stopped talking shit and looked at me through half-open wary eyes, probably
 mindful that some things, and especially things concerning Bobby Barhoe's
 manliness were better left unsaid for a good reason that involved jarred
 bones and bruises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I was visibly seething with anger.
 My male pride had been hurt.
 I almost felt like a proud elk being stripped of its horns, an elephant
 without a trunk, or a stud without its junk.
 It also felt like Ivan was eyeing me creepily, and grinning incongruously
 to every mention of a word even remotely related to intercourse, like 'milk',
 'butter', or 'hoe'.
 Before abject terror pulled at my instincts and made me leap outside a
 truck doing eighty, he turned and said to me with an approving tone, proudly
 waving a badly groomed finger in the air:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

I tried not to think of that as a compliment, or even a comment of any kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve looked slightly miffed, sitting somewhat uncomfortably, nursing his
 jaw.
 It looked like the last punch had left him a purple-coloured souvenir.
 It's only reasonable then that he must've unwillingly disconnected his
 mouth from his brain when he said:

\begin_layout Standard
I was about to punch him a third time in that exact same sweet bruised spot
 and if God was a proponent of applied justice, I would have broken his
 jaw with the added bonus that that would have probably made him shit up
 for the rest of the ordeal, when I felt something with the apparent magnitude
 and force of a giant metal claw tugging at my left shoulder.
 It was Ivan who said:

 I saw the bleak unatrractive greenish scenery that reminded me of mosquitoes

 moment had arrived.
 We were about to meet Eileen.
 Which reminded me then to finish what I had started, and punch Steve in
 the face.
 A moment, a grunt and an expletive later he was complaining:

 the other way.
 He then said with conviction:

I'm not a violent man per se, and it definitely says something for a person
 when he's so eager to punch people in the face and break their legs, but
 in Steve's case, I would bet he could get the Pope mad enough to beat him
 to death with a bible.
 Before there was time to choke him to death, Ivan effectively disarmed
 me with but a few words of very special meaning:

I think my genitalia shrunk to microscopic levels instantly, and my anus

 I looked at Steve in terror and he simply smiled back, impervious to what
 the words implied for my gender.
 Impossibly, trying to ignore the inevitable I smiled back as well and thought
 that staying alive had its good moments, and its rape moments.
 This looked like a rape moment.
 And the funny thing is all I could think of was Nirvana and Kodak.

By that time I had mastered my instincts and even though a proper response

 The door buzzed and I pushed it open.
 We got inside and a powerful smell assaulted me: the smell of a shitload
 of money.
 The large entrance hall was just as I remembered.
 Stately, sparkling clean, filled with incredibly expensive luxury items
 chosen solely because of their price tag.
 There was this wide staircase that led to the upper floors, all marble
 and carpet.
 Pretty standard stuff for a cotton mogul like Eileen's father.

And that was when I caught Eileen with the corner of my eye, falling down
 on me from the floor above, wearing a free-fall jumpsuit, arms outstretched
 looking lying a flying squirrel on drugs, ready to clench me into her death-lov
e-grip.
 I barely had time to freeze like an idiot at the inane sight of her, so
 I couldn't dodge her in time (which would have been an instinctive reaction,
 no harm intended really).
 She simply fell right on top of me and we both fell on the floor.
 I was pretty certain I heard something crack, and while I tried to breath
 again, I heard Steven's voice carrying the unmistakable markings of someone
 on a cocktail of psychedelic drugs:

 I said trying to sound approving, even as I tried to squirm away from her.
 I took a look at Steve and it seemed like he was starting to develop some
 sort of real mental issue.
 He was hugging the wall, mumbling something inaudible and had the look
 of a wide-eyed deer frozen by a couple of approaching headlights.
 I managed to stand back up after a while, Eileen continuously expressing
 her endearment, handling me like a stuffed animal and calling me 'booby-woompy'
, 'etch-a-sketchy' and 'orgasmatron two', among other things.
 Before I could find a way calm her down enough to try and tell her why
 we were there, Steve finally blew a fuse and lost his marbles as if Eileen's
 condition was as catchy as the Embola virus:

I was about to punch him again just as a stop-gap measure, when I saw Eileen
 had quickly acclimatized herself to the added craziness: she was doing
 her best ninja impression, with a length of the parachute wrapped around
 her face as a mask, wielding a three-pronged candle holder like somesort
 of dagger, dancing around, blinking wildly and generally looking very much
 unlike a ninja.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I realised I now had two, instead of just one nutcases to handle, and they
 were helping each other turn me into one of them.
 I tried to fold Steve back into some kind reality that might not involve
 invisible ninja assasins.
 I grabbed him by the shoulders and unglued him from the well, trying to
 say something that made sense:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Maybe you ate something bad on the road? That sandwich? Maybe you put some

His face looked like splitting for just a moment.
 He then blurted:

No chance! Peyote tastes like rabbit pee, that sandwich tasted like snake

 he said and Eileen hove into view with an aerial kick that managed to overturn
 a small

 It also cost me my meager grip on Steve who just snapped at exactly the
 wrong moment.

\end_inset

They're here, man! We got to torch this place! Let me go man!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 he said, kicked me in the nuts and ran away while I collapsed in agony,
 seeing bright spots of many vivid colours and what might have been the
 faint image of a nun wearing a bikini and shorts.
 As I lay down on a persian carpet feeling my balls' declare their independence,
 my gaze unwillingly locked out of focus at what must've been an original
 Trego, and had this had happened to someone else, I'd find the coincidence
 quite charming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen was all over me in the blink of an eye.
 Her eyes looked watery already and she shrieked right into my ear with
 the overtones of a caring nympho:

Oh, Bobby! Bad uncle-bear kicked you in the naughty bits! I'll kiss it better,

While it might've been a welcome change in pace, I had to gather my wits,

\begin_layout Standard
I still lay there panting though, unable to fathom how I'd put myself in
 a situation that involved a crazy woman, a recently acquainted bonafide
 shaman able to summon spirits in possession of a definitely disturbed mind.
 It really felt like a balls-to-the-wall moment.
 I felt Eileen do something really awkward to my hair and then I saw she
 was tasting it, an all too well-known dominating her features.
 I knew then I needed to get up, knock some sense into Steve, preferably
 force-feeding him some of Eileen's leftover meds that were bound to be
 found around the house.
 The developments though, outpaced me, when Steve came into view shouting:

\begin_layout Standard
He looked every bit as mad as a mad scientist of native american heritage
 would, complete with his feathery hat on and wildly unkempt hair.
 Eileen was still hunched right beside me, tracing the carpet with a finger,
 probably unable to understand why there were no puddles ripping outwards
 from the fluffy sea.

Once more in my life, I felt I was on the forefront of modern psychiatric
 analysis and treatment.
 What made things a little different, a bit more urgent and a lot more dangerous
 than what metnal illness professionals faced (more aptly, blabbermouths
 with a degree and a all-you-can-eat LSD buffet at work).
 I knew that gas was notoriously known for a tendency to make things explode
 in flames.
 So I just used, plain, simple, hard logic to try and put things under control
 before it was too late.
 I simply told Steve what I thought of the whole situation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
I tried to picture such a pink, fiendishly devious ninja for a moment, but
 thankfully I failed.
 I tried to make Steve see thing my way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Okay, let's just pretend this place needed some cleansing, and you went
 and turned on the gas in the kitchen.
 But you didn't disconnect the safeties, did you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve held up a handful of nuts, bolts and valves that looked very out of

 I kept my cool and asked him without trembling, at least not visibly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What about that sparkle Steve? You'd have to light it up somehow, man.
 You wouldn't be that crazy, say lighting up a match now, would you?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then I heard Eileen's syrupy voice coming from the direction of the
 kitchen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Papa-bear? Why didn't you say your tummy was empty? I could've cooked you
 your favorite, honey apple-pie with salmon and turkey eggs! And you forgot
 to put some real food along with that tin-foil in the microwave oven, silly
 Bobby!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I tried to make sense of that statement, Steve said the most sensible
 thing I had heard out of his mouth in quite some time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Just run!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had this awkward sensation tingling inside my gut.
 Time seemed to flow much more gently suddenly.
 And I think I started running like some kind of wild animal that sees the
 fires approaching, consuming everything, and flees.
 Only for some inexplicable reason, I wasn't fleeing.
 I wasn't running outside the house.
 I ran inside the kitchen, and saw Eileen happily glued in front of the
 microwave with the tin foil inside, waiting for the clock to reach zero.
 In the sparse few seconds that I envisaged I had yet to live, I grabbed
 her by the waist and carried her outside like a brat about to get a thorough
 beating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wasn't paying thorough attention but I believe she was laughing her heart
 out, flapping her outstretched arms like we were headshowing a very cheap
 production of The Valkyrie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I passed through the open door, I could see Steve running in front of
 me, and realised his athletic scholarship wasn't just some bullshit he'd
 made up.
 I saw the courtyard, and beyond that I could see the path leading to the
 road, and when I felt this giant hand push me up in the air with an urgency
 that belied its deadliness, I realised the bird's-eye view is highly overrated
 and quite unpleasant if one does not possess the ability to land safely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fraction of a second later my ears were ravaged by the sound of the explosion
 that had propelled me and Eileen into the air.
 I had just enough time to think that it was a really shitty thing to die
 about a day earlier than you were supposed to, right before my face connected
 with the dirt horribly and everything went pitch black with a terrible
 thud.

When I came to, I opened my eyes tentatively, half-expecting John the ghost

 SUVs blocking the view to my Taurus, forever and ever.
 Instead, I was cheerfully greeted by Steve who had conveniently propped
 me up against an apple tree which looked like it might have been as old
 as the one that led to the discovery of gravity (a non-trivial force which
 I could vividly remember having challenged with little success).

I instinctively went about finding out whether that was indeed the case,
 and when all the body math checked out I happily concurred that indeed
 I was wholesome.
 I actually felt great.
 I thought it must've been a miracle that I hadn't even broken a single
 bone.
 It was a most welcome turn of events, surviving a gas explosion intact.
 So much in fact that I felt compelled to ask without worry:

And then I saw her lying flat on the ground, her hair curled up around her
 face, tangled like she had just washed her face.
 She looked insanely serene, and that pun was not intended.
 She really looked peaceful.
 Like in a deep sleep or..
 The thought just flashed across my mind like it was being stamped with
 the words by a really fierce customs officer, and my mouth moved of its

What the words implied instantly made my brain sent powerful signals accross
 my body, urging me to go ballistic.
 Holding my head with one hand I could feel my pulse grow stronger and stronger,

 I heard Eileen's voice sweet and calming, as if everything was right as
 pie:

I could see the fire trucks and the sheriff's office had done their part,
 and had extinguished the fire.
 The mansion had turned into a very big piece of charcoal, and we were safely
 and quite pertinently almost half a mile away, idly sitting under a tree,
 looking as innocent as any picknickers.
 The mansion was pretty much far down the road, so there weren't really
 any bystanders or eye-witnessess, and that only meant it would merely be
 a matter of minutes until someone noticed us and thought about coming around
 and start asking questions.
 Steve was probably on the same train of thought when he said somewhat hesitantl

 I said and knew it wasn't me saying that.
 I covered my mouth with one hand in shocked surprise, while the other one
 was on my waist adding to a very feminine body posture which must've looked
 very ridiculous and gay, perhaps much to the chagrin of Steve who paused
 and turned around looking at me like there was overwhelming evidence of
 something weird going on.
 He sighed and said:

I suddenly could move again as if some invisible cords had just snapped.
 I flexed my muscles as if they had been brand new again, and then I dutifully
 proceeded to lift Eileen up and carry her on my shoulder.
 She was a lithe little thing and she wouldn't be a bother until we could
 get down to the road and maybe hail a cab.
 Steve looked a bit worried though, so I asked him:

I think I frowned really hard when I heard that, almost trying to connect
 one eyebrow with the other.
 I was inclined to ask Steve about his thoughts on the strategy of preemptive
 strikes in general, colloquially known as 'shoot first, ask questions later',
 and in this particular instance 'punch first, then punch again'.
 But somehow I felt it would be a very counterproductive thing to do, at
 least until this situation with Eileen had been resolved.
 I'm pretty sure my teeth made a grinding noise when I said:

Steve cleared his throat and settled into a calm, even voice.
 It was what could have passed as the voice of a narrator in a boring documentar
y about the use of poultry in ballistic forensics.
 Speaking from experience though, it was just Steve, indirectly admitting
 he was a huge asshole:

Part of the ritual involves letting the spirits run wild, and free.
 Best way to do that, is make you act like yourself, speak with the heart
 if you will.
 Normally, we would have spend weeks together in the wild, hunting, bonding,
 perhaps bathing naked in ice cold streams, with nothing but the cloudy
 sky for a roof and our knives for shelter.
 The light of the stars would have shone in our souls, and our spirits would
 mingle with the Father Wind, the changer of all things not set in stone.
 And you would learn to feel the currents of Mother Earth flow within you,
 all living things as one force, separate but not divided, unique but not
 alone.
 And your spirit would be ready then.
 But because we had to do this real quick, I improvised and nearly killed
 us all.
 It worked better than I expected.

As we reached the side of the road, I saw a sign right across the other
 side advertising cheap food, strong coffee and liquor, and I quote: 'fit
 for pharmaceutical use'.
 I was genuinely surprised then to see Steve wet his lips with his tongue,
 and look at me with an expression that verged on what I believe mental
 health professionals (yeah, the overpaid quacks) call bipolar disorder.
 The left part of his face was contorted in a jarred grimace, the kind of
 mess that happens to your face when you realise you've put yourself into
 a situation that can only result in abject, petrifying horror or death-of-the-s
oul (kinda like visiting the in-laws or watching the eight o'clock news).

The other half, his right half, shone with the intensity and brilliance

I was getting the impression that Eileen's spirit was somehow different,
 yet the same, from 'Crazy' Eileen.
 Just without the craziness.
 It somehow felt right, kinda made me feel a little bad too.
 But all in all, I felt quite optimistic even though I had less than twenty
 hours to live, the spirit of my ex-wife trapped in my body, and rested
 my hopes on a ghost and a shaman with a drinking problem.

Mama Adele had laid out a really delicate tablecloth, the color of blinding
 white.
 A small feast had been laid out on the table, and the overpowering smell
 of freshly baked cornbread filled the small, homely kitchen.
 Steve was sitting opposite me, hesitant to start eating, constantly flicking
 his gaze between Mama Adele, me, and his plate.
 I was playing around with my fork, trying to appear as I was ready to start
 eating any moment now while in fact I was classifying the potatos on my
 plate according to size, shape, and complexion (an old habit I inherited
 while doing time in prison - it really helped with trying to not think
 about the showers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eileen's body was upstairs, comfortably lying in bed.
 Even though I could use a bit of a nap myself at that point, there was
 very little precious time to waste, and Mama Adele did not help things
 by insisting that we sat down and had supper.
 When she saw Eileen was out cold it seemed as if someone had pulled away
 the world under her feet.
 We told her half of the truth: some kind of trouble, the mansion burned
 to the ground, Eileen knocked unconscious, safe and sound but in need of
 rest.

She'd known the line of business I was in and that I've had some shady dealings
 in the past, and that her father wasn't exactly a virgin in the domain
 of law-breaking, so she knew that whatever it was he had gotten her into,
 a hospital would be a bad idea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
God bless her soul, she grudgingly took her in, on two conditions nevertheless:
 one, that we'd sit down, eat supper, have some coffee, a nice long talk
 and perhaps a couple of beatings.
 Two, if Eileen didn't wake up soon, she'd put a curse on me so vile, that
 I'd wish I'd never been conceived, much less born, and so evil, that'd
 make the devil and all his minions look like pussies (these were, to my
 recollection, her exact words).

She had the relevant experience in the ju-ju crafts and all sorts of dead
 animal parts, as well as all the spunk and the ferocity of a really old
 black lady that had raised Eileen like she had been her own.
 Her dry wrinkled face nevertheless sported piercing cougar-like eyes, and
 if looks could kill, hers would have been a weapon of mass destruction.
 I noticed she was eyeing me with just that kind of a look, and while Eileen
 inside me urged me once more to tell her the truth, before I could open
 my mouth and speak a single word, she motioned me to stay silent, waving
 a bony arthritis-swollen finger and saying:

Steve shot me a look of surprise, like a rabbit popping up from his hiding
 place only to find out the hunting season is still on.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but Mama Adele still had the advantage and
 it didn't look like she was going to give it up anytime soon.
 She put up one hand with a warning finger that made us pause and watch
 as she unbuttoned her blouse with the other hand, slowly and decisively.

Normally the sight of a - probably senile - old woman undressing would have

 lost any meaningful function since before the moon landing.
