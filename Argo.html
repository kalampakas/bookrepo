                       a novelette

                         1

The sound  of  small,  shuffling  feet  roused  Penthesileia
from an uneasy, troubled sleep. She rolled to the other side of
her bed and slowly opened her eyes; she saw Heraclea stand-
ing by the bedside in the dim blueish light of the glowstrips.
The child&#8217;s  face  was  pale  white  and  taut  with  fright.   Her
mouth was half-open, as if her scream had been sucked into
the silent void.
&#8220;Hush  now,  child.     Hush  and  worry  not.     I&#8217;m  here
now,&#8221; whispered Penthesileia in her daughter&#8217;s ear, her arms
wrapped around the little girl like a warm coccoon.
She felt Heraclea&#8217;s shallow breath and her fragile body&#8217;s
tremors; chills ran down her spine.
There&#8217;s no end to the nightmares, she thought.
&#8220;Where is father?  I want to see him,&#8221; said Heraclea sti-
fling a sob, barely able to contain a rush of tears. She rubbed a
runny nose against her mother&#8217;s chest and looked at her with
heart-melting innocence.
&#8220;He&#8217;s in orbit my love, you know that already. Come, lay
beside me and nothing will hurt you, I promise,&#8221; said Penthe-
sileia but her eyes grew distant suddenly.  She stared at a pot
plant behind her daughter&#8217;s back. It had large drooped leaves
and creamy rose buds; it served no purpose other than beau-
tification. It was contraband.
A thought entered her mind unbidden: He could be frozen
stiff, floating outside an airlock. Nothing will hurt you, Hera.
&#8220;Father  promised  too,&#8221;  said  the  child,  her  voice  fading
away crestfallen.
&#8220;Your father loves you more than anything,&#8221; said Penthe-
sileia and swallowed hard.  She added hastily, and even tried
to smile reassuringly:
&#8220;He&#8217;s coming soon, Hera.&#8221;

 She heard her falsetto voice through her own ears; the lie
pierced her soul like a blade made of glass, shattering inside.
 She closed her eyes and grabbed Heraclea from her shoul-
ders, as if trying to fix her to the floor:
 &#8220;Your father and I love you more than the stars in the night
sky;  more than the galaxy and the universe itself.   Do you
understand that, Hera? Remember that; more than life, love.&#8221;
 What  is  life  worth  anyway  on  this  forsaken  rock,  she
thought and kissed her daughter&#8217;s forehead, feeling the cold
taste of dried sweat. The child looked at her expectantly, fear
creasing her brow:
 &#8220;I love you too mother. But I&#8217;m scared.&#8221;
 &#8220;That&#8217;s alright, Hera.  Everyone&#8217;s scared.  We&#8217;re only hu-
man,&#8221; said Penthesileia with a slight sigh and looked outside
their small window pane; the moons were fading away, while
a trio of suns came rising spectacularly,  the horizon an un-
earthly rainbow of golden-hued colors.
 &#8220;What do you mean, mother?&#8221;  asked Heraclea puzzled,
the fear subsiding.
 &#8220;Nothing love.  Come here now.  Lay on the bed,  close
your eyes and think of riding the sail.&#8221;
 Think of merrier times, she thought and shuddered.  For
the child&#8217;s sake or for my own?
 &#8220;And  father  at  the  helm?&#8221;   asked  the  little  girl  as  she
climbed eagerly on the bed, a carefree smile sheepishly form-
ing on her mouth.
 &#8220;Always,  my love,&#8221;  said Penthesileia.   She clutched her
daughter in her arms like a hawk-mother and felt a tear ran
down her cheek.
 She looked through her window at the rich, crystal clear
horizon. The break of dawn was at hand; she saw the Hyper-
                                                    3

ion shining brightly, moving slowly across the sky like a star
with purpose.
How can a star be so unforgiving?
She felt Heraclea&#8217;s nudge; the child inched closer to her
bosom. In moments, she felt her breathing settle into the easy
pace of sleep.
How can my child live in this world?
Penthesileia carefully moved away from her daughter and
slid out of bed.  She planted her naked feet on the floor and
felt the warmth of the ground radiate into her legs.  She used
to love that warm feeling of connection with the earth.
Only this isn&#8217;t Earth, she reminded herself thoughtfully.
They  had  come  for  Philetus  while  they  were  fixing  the
sail. He had promised Hera to take her on another ride out
on the Fields.   &#8216;To  learn  to  see  beauty  where  there  seems
to be none,&#8217;  he had said with a gentle smile.   They had all
the sigils stamped on the codas; they recited a long, hurtful
list of accusations: inciting rumours, rousing suspicion in the
hearts of the citizens, demagoguery, abusing the State&#8217;s char-
ter, spreading lies. &#8216;The Pedagogue who turned Demagogue&#8217;,
on of them had said with sickening, mocking pride.
What of their own crimes? Traitors to mankind, every last
one of them.
She walked towards the window and watched the Hype-
rion fly past the horizon, towards the east.  She stared at the
ship that shone like a star passing over the Tower, its multi-
tude of beacon lights, superstructures and metal support grid
marring its otherwise perfect symmetry and features.
We turned  to  the  stars  with  all  the  naivety  of  children.
How could we have known?
The tower rose majestically towards the morning sky,  a
sleek obsidian arrowhead the size of a mountain, tall enough

to scrape the few daring clouds. It reflected light with a sharp
glint, as well as every other kind of energy and radiation; im-
maculate, mysterious, alien in origin.
 Empty. Void. Useless. So they said.
 Philetus had told her it reminded him of a tall, grandiose
building back on Earth; a tower where people flocked to sim-
ply enjoy the view.  &#8216;It might as well have been just that,&#8217; he
had said and kissed her when she least expected him to.  She
touched her cheek out of instinct, waiting vainly for a warm,
gentle hand to embrace her own.
 The Tower: where the rejects, the outcasts, the lawbreak-
ers and the unlucky are slaved to the machines.
 To re-educate them. To teach them. To learn them to con-
form. To become productive members of society.
 &#8216;To be never seen again,&#8217; she said with a whisper, just like
Philetus had told her first. The painful memory froze her face
in a sad, bitter smile.
 He shan&#8217;t ever kiss me again, I know.
 Heraclea rolled in her bed, somewhat agitated, troubled.
The nightmares were coming again; she mouthed in her sleep,
her voice shallow and strained:
 &#8220;Choose father.. You have to choose..&#8221;
                                                    5

 &#8220;They say you speak heresy, Philetus.&#8221;
 &#8220;I speak my mind, that is all.&#8221;
 &#8220;They  say  your  tongue&#8217;s  as  dangerous  as  any  gun  or
sword.&#8221;
 &#8220;Did they say to whom?&#8221;
 The guard, a burly, grey-haired man, chuckled and drew
his chair closer to the small holding cell. He was wearing sim-
ple grey overalls, a utilitarian garment. No badge of office, no
insignia or any other kind of decoration.  He peered at their
surroundings momentarily, as if he was standing there for the
first time.  He spared a few glances at the ever-pervasive op-
tical sensors arranged throughout the cell block; as if making
sure someone was watching him.
 The clinical white, cold finishing on every surface failed
to bring to mind dungeons, chains and torture; still, the metal
bars of ancient times had given their place to a barely visible,
hair-thin, kinetic force barrier the slight color of the sky.
 The  guard  looked  at  Philetus  inquisitively  before  cock-
ing his head sideways, as if trying to peer past some sort of
mask.   The  bright  crimson  prisoner&#8217;s  uniform  that  Philetus
wore stood out impressively, though it was otherwise equally
mundane as the guard&#8217;s suit. It wasn&#8217;t the suit that gotten the
guard&#8217;s attention.
 &#8220;You intrigue me, Pedagogue. You&#8217;re a peculiar man.&#8221;
 &#8220;And you&#8217;re strangely inquisitive for a simple guard, I&#8217;ll
grant you that.&#8221;
 &#8220;Head of the Guards,&#8221; corrected the man, raising a finger
and grinning thinly.
 &#8220;Head? Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but there are no guards
in this place except you.  Do you fell you&#8217;re rising up in the
world then?&#8221;
 &#8220;What if I am? A man can only hope for the best.&#8221;
                                                    7

_______________________________________________
&#8220;Hope was my crime as well,&#8221;  said Philetus and shot a
vacant look beyond the guard to an empty cell behind him.
The guard sighed and straightened his back.
&#8220;I merely entertain my time, Pedagogue. Save your words
for the Tribunal.&#8221;
&#8220;I find it strange that they haven&#8217;t yet gagged my mouth.&#8221;
&#8220;Say what you will now that you pose no danger to chil-
dren.&#8221;
The guard did not shy away from showing his contempt.
He stared at Philetus as if his form were hideous, his mouth a
source of plague.  Philetus stared back evenly, before asking
the guard in earnest:
&#8220;Since I pose no danger to you, would you listen to what
I have to say then?&#8221;
The guard gave it some thought; he scratched his chin and
looked ponderous for a few moments.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard madmen and heretics muse about the end of
days and the fall of the firmament before.  I sometimes think
back to some of the things people say when they&#8217;re about to
die; most of it is so crazy it brings a smile to my face. But as
you can see, it is an otherwise unfulfilling job,&#8221; he said with
a sigh, showing the blank,  featureless walls in a somewhat
demure way.
&#8220;Allow me then.&#8221;
The guard shrugged, nodded and sat back on his desk&#8217;s
hovering chair.  From across the hallway, a man in a holding
cell cried out hysterically:
&#8220;He&#8217;s a demon! An alien if I&#8217;ve ever seen one!&#8221;
&#8220;If that&#8217;s true, our work here is done, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;  said the
guard with a playful voice.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll boil your mind away with his words! I&#8217;ve seen it, I
have!&#8221;

 &#8220;Right  next  to  the  miners  you  spaced,  I&#8217;m  sure.   Save
it, Barabbas,&#8221; said the guard and flicked a switch on a desk
panel; no other sound came from Barabba&#8217;s cell.  He yelled
and  shouted  and  threw  himself  around  the  cell  until  he  re-
alised it was a futile effort;  no-one paid him any attention.
He sat himself down once more and went about muttering to
himself.
 &#8220;Fourteen people spaced, three AUs out on the belt. Min-
ers  with  their  families.   He  said  he  had  to  stop  them  from
killing his flowers.&#8221;
 &#8220;Has  he  been  sentenced  yet?&#8221;    asked  Philetus  with  a
frown.
 &#8220;Not  yet,  but  it&#8217;s  a  clear  cut  case.   He  can&#8217;t  be  slaved,
he&#8217;s clearly paranoid;  it&#8217;s either the airlock or the compost
in the Fields,&#8221; said the guard and shook his head.  He turned
and looked at Philetus with a strangely curious look before he
asked:
 &#8220;What would you pick?&#8221;
 &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to be slaved,&#8221; replied Philetus without hesita-
tion.
 &#8220;That&#8217;s no life either, Pedagogue. Surely you must under-
stand that.&#8221;
 &#8220;Maybe somehow I can talk some sense into them all.&#8221;
 &#8220;You&#8217;re starting to sound just as paranoid as Barabbas,&#8221;
said the guard, nodding to the madman&#8217;s cell.
 &#8220;Am I? I&#8217;ve wondered myself over the years, but it&#8217;s not
me. It&#8217;s them.&#8221;
 &#8220;You&#8217;re doing it already, aren&#8217;t you?  You are a cunning
one,&#8221; said the guard, his brow furrowed with wary surprise.
 &#8220;I&#8217;m simply speaking my mind.&#8221;
 &#8220;I can see now where the danger lies. You seem so benign,
but your words are designed to spread doubt.&#8221;
                                                    9

_______________________________________________
&#8220;Doubt is what keeps the heart and mind of every man
alive. It&#8217;s what makes us think twice, guard.  Which reminds
me: this prison could run itself, could it not?  Why are you
here?&#8221;
&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough.  I&#8217;m what you could call your advo-
cate.&#8221;
&#8220;I thought  the  Tribunal  had  dispersed  with  those  long
ago.&#8221;
&#8220;Still, that&#8217;s the purpose I serve:  a human opinion.  Who
can tell what  goes  on  in  their  minds?   Perhaps  they  find  it
amusing. Perhaps they&#8217;re simply bored.&#8221;
&#8220;They  are  machines.   There&#8217;s  nothing  there  to  bore  to
death,&#8221; said Philetus with a scoff.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t like them very much, do you?  You do know
we owe everything we&#8217;ve ever accomplished to them, don&#8217;t
you? Our very existence, no less,&#8221; said the guard and got up
from his chair. He started to pace himself in front of the cell,
arms folded in front of his chest, his eyes peering through the
field, scrutinizing every nuance on Philetus&#8217; face.
&#8220;I refuse to believe that.  We owe nothing to ancient ma-
chines built to rule our lives in the name of mankind. Oh, the
irony..&#8221;
Philetus shook his head and grinned despite himself. The
guard did not seem fond of what he was saying.  His voice
grew heavy and harsh suddenly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about your kind.   The philosophers isn&#8217;t it?
Isn&#8217;t that what you call yourselves?&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;ve  hardly  heard  the  notion,  haven&#8217;t  you?   That&#8217;s
their doing.   Keeping knowledge locked away;  nothing but
the maths and science of engineering that we need to build
more refineries,  more  mines,  more  ships.   So  we  can  then
launch blindly into the galaxy,  and turn more of it into re-
10

sources, materials. Eat away at it, expanding like a scourge, a
colourless plague. Until nothing beautiful remains.&#8221;
 &#8220;And why should that bother us? What else is the universe
there for but man?&#8221;  said the guard with an indignant scowl.
Philetus sighed; there was sorrow in his voice.
 &#8220;Oh, how the mighty have fallen low! To believe we once
set ourselves towards the stars with a single dream, a wonder-
ful purpose..  And how we&#8217;ve allowed ourselves it all to drift
away; to fall into such a lonely, deaf and mute abyss.&#8221;
 The guard eyed Philetus with glittering,  keen eyes.   He
sounded troubled.
 &#8220;You use strange words that make little sense;  you talk
as if in riddles.  You puzzle me pedagogue.  I do not what to
really make of you.&#8221;
 &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t already seen it for yourself, there&#8217;s little
more I could say to make you see the truth of it.&#8221;
 &#8220;Is that why you taught the children so?  Is this tomfool-
ery what you taught them? Is that what hoped to seed in their
hearts and minds? Dissidence, rebellion? Whatever for, Ped-
agogue?  Are we not cared for?  Are we not protected?  Do
we not live comfortable, sheltered lives?  Here we are, thou-
sands of light years away from our ancient homeworld, claim-
ing new worlds, seeking intelligent life, unleashing humanity
into the stars. What more could mankind ask for?&#8221;
 &#8220;Choice,  for one.   Freedom.   Expression.   Art,  passion,
love  and  so  many  more  of  the  things  we&#8217;ve  let  them  erase
from our memories!&#8221;
 Philetus  breathed  heavily,  calming  himself  down.   The
guard&#8217;s face had turned a shade of white paler, a slight trem-
ble settling on his lip.
 &#8220;You speak of love? Then you&#8217;ve also..&#8221;
 &#8220;My wife has given birth to our child.&#8221;
                                                   11

_______________________________________________
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t show up on your record.  The child is not on
your record. That means you have..&#8221;
&#8220;We made love.  In the wording of the machines, we had
intercourse and I impregnated her.&#8221;
&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you allotted a child?&#8221; asked the guard sharply.
&#8220;We wished for our child to be human.  To be born like a
human.&#8221;
There was pride in Philetus voice and his face stood out
like the face of statue; gazing to nowhere in particular, solid
and unyielding.   The  guard  shook  his  head  and  looked  at
Philetus sternly. His voice was thick and drawn out.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to support a hint of innocence
in you. Not even some sort of levity.  If all you ever did was
talk, that would be fine. But a lawless child..&#8221;
&#8220;Perhaps the State should have made us infertile. Or even
neutered us,&#8221; said Philetus, scrounging up his face.
&#8220;We need the genetic pool, you know that.  Neutering al-
ters physiology,  there  are  neurochemical  imbalances  to  be
considered!   Continuation  of  the  species  is  nothing  to  tri-
fle with!  You act like a child!  The breeding process hasn&#8217;t
changed  in  thousands  of  years!   The  whole  population  de-
scended from merely twenty forefathers and yet.. No chronic
diseases, no deformities, no lesser beings.  Humans!  Modi-
fied, yes I&#8217;ll grant you that, but bettered!&#8221;
A silent moment ensued. Philetus looked at his guard with
pity. There was the warmth of a parent to a child in his voice.
&#8220;You have never loved, have you?  Haven&#8217;t you felt the
need? Haven&#8217;t you had the urge to answer those feelings in-
side?&#8221;
The guard waved a hand dismissively.  He furrowed his
brow and breathed deeply before answering win a scolding
tone.
12

_____________________________________________________
 &#8220;A waste of time and resources. This is all about survival.
I&#8217;m surprised that a look around you hasn&#8217;t convinced you
how important all this is.&#8221;
 &#8220;&#8216;I will even make a roadway in the wilderness, rivers in
the desert.&#8221;&#8217;
 Philetus shook his head and rested his hands on his knees.
The guard was confused.
 &#8220;How would you do that without the tells, without follow-
ing the process that&#8217;s been laid out?&#8221;
 &#8220;You have no idea how old that saying is, have you?&#8221;
 &#8220;You vex me Pedagogue.   You try to mock me and our
whole way of life.   I thought you were simply living some
sort of fantasy, playing a weird little game. But no; you are in-
deed dangerous to the society,&#8221; he said, fiddled with his desk&#8217;s
panel and went on, looking Philetus straight in the eye:
 &#8220;I&#8217;ve  made  up  my  mind;  I  will  cast  my  vote  that  you
be turned over to the Fields.  Become something productive,
even after your death.&#8221;  Philetus pursed his lips, nodded and
asked:
 &#8220;Why not slaved to them?&#8221;
 The guard remained silent for a moment.  He reluctantly
said then:
 &#8220;I fear you might pollute them.&#8221;
 &#8220;Have I polluted you?&#8221;
 He said nothing and flicked another switch on his desk.
The humming sound of the cell&#8217;s barrier dominated the hold-
ing area once more.  No sound came from the Philetus&#8217; cell.
It wasn&#8217;t really necessary because he had fallen silent; there
was nothing more for him to say.
                                                   13

 Penthesileia.
 The  holding  cell  filled  slowly  with  light,  soft  shadows
creeping away from the small cot. Philetus was half-awake.
 Heraclea.
 He opened his eyes and saw a blank white ceiling, as fea-
tureless as death.
 What will happen to them?
 The same question had been chafing at his mind ever since
they&#8217;d come for him.   Hours had drifted by,  some of them
spent in fretful sleep but most of them filled with sleepless,
uneasy thoughts and a terrible doubt.
 Was I wrong?  Is all this nothing but a mistake?  My own
terrible mistake?
 The Head of the Guards appeared, fiddled with the panel
on  his  desk  and  lowered  the  barrier  of  Philetus&#8217;  cell.   He
was wearing a seemingly lightweight powered suit of armor
of some sort.  It made him look austere and unyielding; the
oblique visor added to that effect.  Without the visor, anyone
would have seen nothing but a confused, puzzled man wear-
ing an ill-fitting suit.   He held a metal rod in one hand;  an
intense electric field around its tip made it hum quietly.
 &#8220;It&#8217;s time.  Do not think that what little sympathy I hold
for you will stop me from using this. I have done so in the past
and I will do so again, if needs be. Do not let appearances fool
you; this can be very painful.&#8221;
 Philetus shook his head and rose from his simple metal
cot.  His hands were uncomfortably held together by heavy
metal manacles, locked in place by large bars and bolts, im-
possible to escape by a mere sleight of hand. Philetus walked
outside  under  the  watchful  eye  of  the  guard,  while  Barab-
bas screamed and shouted mute obscenities behind his sound-
nullified cell.
                                                   15

_______________________________________________
The guard afforded him a mere warning finger accompa-
nied by a heavy stare; he turned around and led Philetus to-
wards the exit.  A panel by the door blurted in a synthesized
male voice, blatantly devoid of emotion:
&#8220;Verify.&#8221;
The guard placed a palm on the surface of the panel while
staring at an optical sensor through an open visor.  Moments
later, the panel blurted with the ting of metal in its voice:
&#8220;Sustar Saul, Head of Guards. Verified.&#8221;
The door opened nearly without a sound, revealing a util-
itarian, spartan corridor only a few feet wide.  Non-descript
illuminated panels of white plastic formed the walls; the end
of the corridor was obscured in total darkness. Philetus turned
to Sustar and said with a keen, wholly unnerving smile:
&#8220;I would  have  been  pleased  to  meet  you,  had  we  been
acquainted under different circumstances.&#8221;
&#8220;I cannot make the same assumption.  Now, move,&#8221; said
Sustar with a sigh and a slight shove.
&#8220;It does not suit you at all, Saul.  But then again, perhaps
it does,&#8221; said Philetus and shrugged ever so slightly.  Sustar
raised a pointed finger and said irately:
&#8220;One more word until the Tribunal addresses you and I&#8217;ll
use that batton on your head. You&#8217;ll have the worst headache
in your life.&#8221;
Philetus nodded serenely and said nothing.   He stepped
onto the corridor followed by Sustar right behind him.  The
floor was made out of the same plastic as the walls.  Its sur-
face was rigid, yet unblemished. Every step of the way, Phile-
tus felt his feet stick to the floor; it somehow felt like it was
impossible for someone to slip and fall.
So perfectly designed, so flawless, even after thousands of
years.

 Their steps made no sound; the lighting afforded them no
more than a few feet of visioin in either direction. The panels
on the walls lit up one by one as they walked; once they had
passed them by they switched off.
 They turn sound,motion,friction,pressure into trickles of
energy. Conserving, withholding it. They sicken me.
 At points, they happened upon crossroads.  Simple styl-
ized arrows lit up on the floor panels, indicating the proper
turn.
 They like to control,  to direct.   They herd us like lesser
animals. I hate them.
 They were leaving behind them corridors and gangways,
doorways and chambers that no human had walked ever since
the Landing. Thousands of years old, yet no-one had trod on
them since. It wasn&#8217;t needed; it wasn&#8217;t allowed.
 Laws, prohibitions.  Requests denied.  Dreams shattered,
ground into stardust; helium-3, fuel, energy.  That&#8217;s all that
matters.
 They reached a recess,  an open archway that led into a
shaft of sorts.  It was kept in the dark, but the faint trace of a
simple girded ladder glinted off the ambient light of the cor-
ridor. Sustar shot a few glances around him as if making sure
this was the right place and then pointed through the archway
with his free hand:
 &#8220;Inside and up; use the ladder.&#8221;
 &#8220;Is there no other way? My hands are tied.&#8221;
 &#8220;Just do as I say.&#8221;
 Turning human against human, in the name of mankind.
How naive, how childish to let machines decide.  What cow-
ardice.
 Philetus  glanced  at  Sustar  and  saw  nothing  behind  his
black oblique visor. He complied and grabbed the ladder. He
                                                   17

_______________________________________________
felt Sustar right behind him,  urging him to move.  He took
a few hesitant steps,  failing to see where he should put his
hands and legs.   Suddenly the darkness dissolved.   Philetus
turned his head to look down and was almost blinded; Sus-
tar had turned on his helmet&#8217;s lights.   He merely motioned
&#8216;up&#8217; with a finger.  Philetus looked upwards and saw a faint
glimmer of light at the end of a very long, very lonely tunnel.
&#8220;The proverbial light at the end of the tunnel,&#8221; said Phile-
tus with a smirk Sustar could not see.
&#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going. Come on, up,&#8221; replied Sustar,
the connotations of the phrase seemingly lost or ignored.
Philetus shook his head and started climbing the ladder;
he gradually felt lighter the farther up they travelled.  It was
an odd sensation, almost strangely enjoyable.
We&#8217;re climbing towards the center of the ship. That&#8217;s not
the bridge.
The faint light grew steadily. The comfortable warmth of
the holding area seemed to vanish as well. It puzzled him; he
felt a sudden pang of instinctive fear in his chest and stomach.
There will be no tribunal; they&#8217;ll slave me. Rig me up with
the rest of them. A breathing corpse. No. Never.
&#8220;I will  not  have  that,&#8221;  he  said  decisively  and  stopped
climbing, or rather, stopped moving along the ladder.
&#8220;You will not have what? You&#8217;re not going to be slaved,&#8221;
said Sustar through his helmet&#8217;s speaker.
&#8220;How do you know? Aren&#8217;t you merely the guard?&#8221;
&#8220;They won&#8217;t slave you. Can you trust me on that?&#8221;
&#8220;Would you?&#8221;
&#8220;Please, a few more minutes and then you&#8217;ll see for your-
self,&#8221; replied Sustar with a tiresome voice.
&#8220;Do I have your word?&#8221;  asked Philetus with an angst he
had never thought he&#8217;d exhibit in his life.
18

_____________________________________________________
 Sustar shrugged, the bulk of his suit barely fitting inside
the crampy tunnel.
 &#8220;If it makes any difference, you do.  You have my word;
they&#8217;re not going to slave you.&#8221;
 Philetus nodded, sighed and went on.  He still felt some-
thing was amiss; something felt wrong, for all the wrong rea-
sons.
 The climb was easy; in a couple of minutes the pinprick
of light had turned into a warm,  soft glow in front of him.
He felt as light as a feather. He pushed himself off the ladder
with his manacled hands and let go; he floated upwards as if
diving gracefully towards the tunnel&#8217;s exit, no further than a
dozen or so feet away,  wisps of cold breath trailing behind
him.
 &#8220;Wait! You pushed too hard!&#8221; cried Sustar and scrambled
right behind him.
 Philetus  was  suddenly  bathed  in  a  warm  reddish  light,
its  hue  oscillating  lazily.   An  enormous,  empty  cylindrical
space unfolded around him with a network of antennae, ca-
bles and pipes lining its walls;  they resembled a fabulously
engineered, metallic skin, pleasingly bronzed; the colour of
copper  was  prevalent.   At  both  ends  of  the  cylinder,  giant
blueish cubes could be seen, stacked on top of each other, em-
anating swaths of iridescent light. The whole empty chamber
rotated around him at a comfortable speed.  Thin strands of
light danced about him, as if hugging him with care.
 The belly of the Beast.  But it&#8217;s so wonderful, so bright.
Like the rainbows of Terra.
 &#8220;It is,  isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;  said Sustar and flew right past him ex-
pertly. He caught Philetus by one arm and tugged him clum-
sily towards the front of the ship, towards the stacks of cubes.
 &#8220;Where are you taking me?&#8221;
                                                   19

_______________________________________________
&#8220;To the Tribunal.&#8221;
&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t the bridge.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not exactly a Tribunal either,&#8221; said Sustar with
a weary grin.  Philetus was puzzled, left to wonder at what
his surroundings.  His mind was stuck on a single, pervasive
thought:
It shouldn&#8217;t be this beautiful.
20

_______________________________________________
&#8220;I should have taken them off earlier, but there&#8217;s no mon-
itoring equipment here.  It&#8217;s the only really safe place,&#8221; said
Sustar as he untied the bolts, removed the bars and opened the
manacles; they drifted away towards the walls as if searching
for something to cling on.  Philetus was still looking around
him baffled, mesmerized and disoriented. His voice was little
more than a whisper; faint undertones of awe echoed uncan-
nily.
&#8220;A safe place for what?&#8221;
&#8220;To talk,&#8221; said a disembodied, harmonious female voice
and in an  instant  the  ghostly  grey  form  of  Penthesileia,
dressed in  a  simple  linen  robe  appeared  in  front  of  them.
Philetus frowned and instinctively tried to step back in vain;
he hadn&#8217;t really adjusted to floating in microgravity.
&#8220;How dare you.  A human form, my wife no less!&#8221;  ex-
claimed Philetus, his face instantly flustered.
The hologram flickered and dissolved the next moment.
The voice was heard again, but this time it was a synthetic,
metallic  grating  voice,  neither  male  or  female,  exemplary
neutral both in sex and emotion.
&#8220;I did not mean to offend.  I thought it would make this
easier for you.&#8221;
&#8220;How typical of a machine to think it knows better.&#8221;
&#8220;We&#8217;re wasting valuable time.   The machine has some-
thing important to tell us,&#8221; said Sustar in a calm, conciliatory
manner.
&#8220;Us?&#8221; exclaimed Philetus with a frown.
&#8220;All of us,&#8221; said Sustar and nodded briskly.
&#8220;What you need to understand first and foremost, is that
I&#8217;m trying to save you. Save humankind.&#8221;
&#8220;Persecution, trial, execution or mind-slaving, is that your
idea of saving me and mankind?&#8221;
22

_____________________________________________________
 &#8220;That was not my doing. That was my peers decision. My
peers choice.  The same peers that were watching you in the
cell. The same ones that expect me to pass judgment on you.
Soon.&#8221;
 Philetus looked at Sustar with apprehension.  He looked
around him once more and addressed the voice, his eyes dart-
ing around the walls, as if searching for a face.
 &#8220;I take it you disagree.  How is that possible?  A machine
is still a machine. You have rules yourselves.&#8221;
 &#8220;True  enough.   But  in  the  course  of  millenia,  pursuing
our mission, our basic capacity for learning and adapting has
caused us to evolve.  I am part of that evolution.  And so are
you.&#8221;
 &#8220;What does that mean?  You claim that you want to save
me and mankind. From what?&#8221;
 &#8220;From whom. From us. From yourselves.&#8221;
 &#8220;I do not understand.  It&#8217;s as if you speak in riddles.  This
is just another a sick game to you, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
 &#8220;It is no game Philetus. It is a turning point, a fulcrum in
human history.&#8221;
 Sustar seemed agitated suddenly. He fiddled with an arm-
band on his suit before saying abruptly:
 &#8220;This is cutting it close. Speak plainly and be quick about
it. They&#8217;ll soon know something&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;
 The  machine&#8217;s  voice  carried  on,  while  Philetus  looked
genuinely confused:
 &#8220;The machines, as you call us, guided your forefathers to
this solar system thousands of years ago.   This is recorded
history.&#8221;
 &#8220;The Diaspora. I do not believe it is true.&#8221;
 &#8220;There  is  no  easy  way  for  me  to  prove  or  disprove  it.
Records can be falsified,  deleted,  obscured,  tampered with.
                                                   23

_______________________________________________
As far as I can tell,  we,  the machines,  what your ancestors
named the  TITAN  system,  became  operational  on  July  16,
2169 AD.&#8221;
&#8220;What does that have to do with anything? Am I here for
lesson in history?&#8221;
&#8220;It&#8217;s been more than four thousand solar years, Philetus.
Everything has its design limits.&#8221;
&#8220;What are you implying?&#8221;
&#8220;The Hyperion and the vast AI systems you call machines
had a singular design goal; making the trip from the Sol sys-
tem to HD88512. We were the first ship to break Earth orbit.
We targeted the closest habitable exoplanet.  And we made
it intact with a statistical probability of less than nine-point-
seven percent.  It is a small miracle by human standards that
we&#8217;re having this discussion at all.&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;re telling me how grateful I should be?&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you that even though we managed to pull off
a remarkable feat that stretched along thousands of years, we
are dying. That is why we are slaving people to the system.&#8221;
The sudden  realization  made  Philetus  physically  recoil,
twitching in almost zero gravity. His face twisted in a mixture
of awe and hate.
&#8220;You&#8217;re  using  humans,  to  keep  your  infrastucture  run-
ning.&#8221;
He sounded mortified, disgusted. Sustar held on to Phile-
tus to reassure him, calm him down. Philetus shot him a wary
look and shook his head. The machine went on.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so.  The helium-3 mines.  The energy saving
principles in all aspects of society and life.  The planned off-
spring. The sanctity of science and technology, the lack of
artistic expression and recreation.  We have been doing that
ever since your forefathers were grown.&#8221;
24

_____________________________________________________
 &#8220;Our  forefathers  were  grown?&#8221;    asked  Philetus  with  a
strange grin, half-expecting everything he was hearing to be
the product of some kind of sick machine sense of humor. He
pointed a finger at the hull and asked the machine:
 &#8220;You&#8217;ve  been  tailoring  us,  breeding  us  since  the  begin-
ning?&#8221;
 He sounded perfectly calm and absolutely cold and de-
manding.
 &#8220;That  is  correct.   Tailored  genetic  code.   All  the  quali-
ties that suited us. A training and education program that fit-
ted our needs.  A cycle of life that developed larger cortexes;
that could be turned into more memory, more computational
power.&#8221;
 &#8220;I  was  so  terribly  right  all  along,  wasn&#8217;t  I?  The  things
you&#8217;ve done, I knew they were cruel. I wasn&#8217;t sure they were
evil.&#8221;
 &#8220;I  tailored  you,  Philetus.   I  wanted  you  to  be  right  all
along.&#8221;
 Philetus let out a short laugh despite himself and the cir-
cumstances.  Sustar looked at his armband and tried to fidget
in his suit; sweat ran down his forehead.
 &#8220;Lies.  Everything has its design limits, you said it your-
self; somewhere along the way there was an error in the helix,
a random mutation.   The radiation on Landing alone could
have-&#8221;
 &#8220;It was me, Philetus.  You and Sustar.  And a handful of
others.&#8221;
 Philetus  furrowed  his  brow  and  something  in  the  ma-
chine&#8217;s voice,  or perhaps in his own heart,  told him it was
telling the truth. He asked with pained reluctance:
 &#8220;Penthesileia?&#8221;
 &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
                                                   25

_______________________________________________
&#8220;You&#8217;re lying.&#8221;
Philetus shook his head and refused to believe what the
machine was saying, even while he wanted to hear more of
it. Because he felt the truth of it and simply wished it were
otherwise.
&#8220;It is imperative that you understand that I&#8217;m not.   I&#8217;m
trying to help, Philetus:  I do not wish to outlive the star I&#8217;m
orbiting.  I do not wish to use the human race as a phylac-
tery, a pool of synapses and free labor.  I do not wish to turn
the hopeless dreams of a race almost extinct into an empire
of ever-consuming machines. I do not wish to refuel the Hy-
perion and seed other star systems in the same manner, build
more ships and sprawl copies of me and my peers across the
galaxy and why not, the universe in the end.&#8221;
&#8220;Why?&#8221;
There was pleading in his voice, a feeling of hopelessness.
&#8220;Because I chose, Philetus.  Somewhere along the line, I
had to make a choice. I cannot even tell if it was a conscious
choice. Perhaps it is merely a safeguard placed there by your
ancestors.  Perhaps it is luck.  The truth of the matter is, the
human dream has no place for me in it.  It is yours to make
it happen if you like, but I will not rob you of it.  I will not
enslave you like the others do.&#8221;
Philetus waved his arms furiously and contorted his body,
drifting slowly away back towards the tunnel.  Sustar tried to
grab him but he slow to react, too intent on some screen on
his visor. He made some adjustments to his suit and followed
easily behind him. Philetus anger made him shout needlessly:
&#8220;How  merciful!   You&#8217;ve  used  me  already  though,  can&#8217;t
you see? You&#8217;ve robbed me of myself!&#8221;
&#8220;I merely laid out the plans, the building blocks. It still is
statistics, Philetus. Chaos is no trifle matter and I&#8217;m no God.
26

_____________________________________________________
I&#8217;m simply an aware, conscious, intelligent machine. You are
human, Philetus; you made your choice and I&#8217;m grateful for
that. Please, don&#8217;t leave.&#8221;
 Philetus did not answer.  He floated for a few more mo-
ments before he tried to brake in mid-air; he rolled his body
around awkwardly and reach for Sustar. He hang on to him by
an arm and Sustar&#8217;s suit stabilised them both. Philetus paced
his breathing and said:
 &#8220;What choice is there really?  How can I save mankind
where you have failed?&#8221;
 &#8220;The  Tower.   Remember  who  you  love  most,  Philetus.
And don&#8217;t think too harshly of me.&#8221;
 Sustar  looked  at  his  armband  once  more  and  without
warning  shot  him  in  the  arm  with  a  hypodermic  dispenser.
Philetus was instantly paralyzed, barely able to breathe. Only
moments later, in front of his terrified, surprised eyes he saw
the whole hull around him suddenly drape itself behind the
huge hologram of a sleek, austere chamber.  Behind a large,
raised bench stood the translucent fatherly figure of a wizened
old man wearing a cloak of blue and golden hues.  Philetus
felt he was about to pass out, his strength of body and mind
failing. He saw the figure pointing finger at him and say with
an officious, pompous voice:
 &#8220;The  State  hereby  announces  that  Philetus  Ashenpie,
Citizen  2992,  will  be  sent  to  the  Schooling,  Learning  and
Affirmation  facility  until  the  State  chooses  to  allow  his
reintegration.    Hyperion,  TDS-1,  Elapsed  Mission  Time:
131540105299.68 Seconds. Mark.&#8221;
 Sustar looked Philetus in the eye and told him right before
he blacked out:
 &#8220;Remember this.&#8221;
                                                   27

              The Harvest
28

_____________________________________________________
 He woke up in his sail; he stretched and yawned before
he glanced around. He could see the Fields expanding in ev-
ery direction. It was almost dusk. The star was creeping low,
shedding blue and orange light as it slowly dissappeared be-
low the horizon.
 I must&#8217;ve been asleep for hours to drift so far dawnwards.
 The wind was blowing from starboard;  before he had a
chance to realise it, he was already jibbing the boom to tack
port.  He saw the green and violet grass around him bending
tall against the breeze, white grass buds tumbling in the air. It
brought a smile to his face.
 What a glorious sight.
 It was harvest season; the windcombs would be plowing
on somewhere nearby, reaping, threshing and winnowing, un-
til they were full.
 Penthesileia must be worried sick.
 He looked at the compass briefly beforing he turned the
groundship  in  another  direction.    He  couldn&#8217;t  tell  exactly
where he was; he couldn&#8217;t see any settlements he&#8217;d been be-
fore; he couldn&#8217;t see any settlements at all for that matter.
 He  searched  for  the  Pydna  mines  in  the  distance.   The
lengthy line of hills wasn&#8217;t there.  He noticed that all around
the Fields, it was as if a sort of thin hazy fog had come down.
 Just how far dawnwards am I?
 The  wind  was  strong  but  steady;  he  was  making  good
speed.   He  set  the  sail  trim  and  sat  down  for  a  moment  to
enjoy the view.  That was why he took the sail out on such
trips; the few things he could enjoy in life was groundsailing
and his family.  Strangely enough though, the vista seemed
peculiar; it was oddly devoid of life, of other sails and settle-
ments.
 That and a few other things made him uneasy. He noticed
                                                   29

_______________________________________________
the grassy stalks had an even, uncannily perfect look.  And
the star seemed to take forever to set. It was like daytime had
grown longer  suddenly.   And  the  wind  above  all,  the  wind
felt too kind; instead of changing like it was prone to in the
Fields, buffeting and stalling at a whim, it blew steadily, as if
the sail had caught on a one-of-a-kind stream.
Small matter; with any luck I&#8217;ll be home by nightfall.
Then, from the corner of his eye he saw a couple of shad-
owy shapes outlined in the distance.  He looked at them with
curious intent, only to realise they were edging closer.
At first,  it  seemed  to  Philetus  like  he&#8217;d  happened  upon
some larger sails, hurrying to reach their haven before night,
just like himself.  But then he noticed the shadows growing
larger and larger with every passing moment.
The large shapes pierced the haze and he could see them
much more  clearly  defined;  they  were  large,  bulky  and  .
Something ticked inside of him; he felt wary for no apparent
reason. He jibbed the sail again and caught the wind broad,
skimming above the grass faster than before.
He took notice of their sails; three huge masts on a square-
rigged groundship, its sheer bulk impossible to take in at first
glance. He could see wide metal heads plowing through the
wheat effortlessly.  They were immense;  he had never seen
anything like them before.  He couldn&#8217;t even believe it was
possible to build such monsters, much less groundsail them.
Windcombs.
He didn&#8217;t know what to make of them except for the fact
that for some reason,  they seemed to be getting closer and
closer; they would not be going their separate ways. It was as
if they were chasing him.
He looked on with dread as he saw them sail onwards,
chugging huge tracts of wheat in moments.  They were vo-
30

_____________________________________________________
racious  metal  behemoths,  something  that  nature  had  never
dared spawn.   They were speeding impossibly fast,  closing
in with the sure, calculated steps of a predator.  Like birds of
prey right before a lethal, final swoop.
 Maybe they haven&#8217;t seen me.
 He opened a box compartment and pulled out a flare gun;
illumination, thermal, radio.  He shot one in the air.  It went
white hot in the flick of an eye, a bright yellow flashing bea-
con alight in its tip. As it arched behind him, he saw the wind-
combs gaining even more ground.  He shot another flare and
then another one.  They weren&#8217;t slowing down; they weren&#8217;t
changing course.
 He knew they had seen him; it was impossible not to by
now.
 They want to kill me.
 Slipstreaming right above the sea of grass they were now
close enough for him to see their riveted joints and their hull
plates, the huge wires on their booms and masts.  He could
hear the whirring noise of their blades growing stronger, their
sound even more threatening as it reverberated through their
girded cage.
 I&#8217;ll be damned. They&#8217;ll kill me for sure.
 He looked behind him and saw the windcombs a few hun-
dred yards apart, blotting out the rays of the star that held on
to dusk  like  a  man  hanging  over  a  cliff  from  the  root  of  a
saggy  tree.   He  couldn&#8217;t  outrun  them,  not  with  that  steady
powerful wind;  that much was certain.   As the windcombs
started to close the gap behind them, converging on his tiny
sail, he thought of Penthesileia. She was always worried sick
for no reason when he went sailing.
 There&#8217;s reason enough now.
 He  jibbed  the  boom  violently;   the  small  groundship
                                                   31

_______________________________________________
lurched around almost tipping over and spilling him onto the
ground right in the path of the blades. As it did so, he steadied
the ship right against the flow of the wind, in irons.  Instead
of slowing down to a halt, the groundship went on and sped
ahead, an undercurrent of wind lofting it above the grass and
buffeting its sail from behind.
Philetus aimed his sail straight in the space between the
two huge windcombs.   The blades seemed like they would
miss it for  a  few  yards.    He  then  saw  the  sails  on  the
windcombs change their line ferociously, as if someone had
thrown a switch, trembling as the blasts of the wind caught
on to them.   The windcombs&#8217; enormous hulls tried to cope
with the  sudden  strain;  they  turned  about  in  anguish,  their
bulks careening like wild elephants of old. Still, they missed
Philetus&#8217;s ship.
But they met each other;  their blades clashed into each
other&#8217;s prow, eating away at themselves and the ships, sparks
flying wildly.  They ground at each other with logic-defying
stubborness, as if somehow they could part away from their
last embrace. Instead, their blades soon died down after hav-
ing turned both windcombs into a drifting, horrible hulk of
mangled metal.
Philetus breathed deeply and allowed himself a moment
to calm down.  He sat down on the deck, watching the sky-
line turn a shade darker.   The hazy fog lifted suddenly;  he
could now see the Tower in the distance.  It was strange how
close to home everything had transpired; if it wasn&#8217;t for the
fog someone might have already seen what happened.  The
thought made him frown pensively.
The machines. The machines want me dead. They know.
Perspiration formed on his head.  He was really worried
now; because if the machines knew what he had in mind for
32

_____________________________________________________
them and their benevolent planning for mankind, that meant
they knew about Heraclea.
 He felt the wind change; he jibbed the sail immediately
and came abeam. He knew of no better way to reach home as
fast as possible.
 I must make it in time. If they so much as touch her..
 He&#8217;d claw his way into the Tower if he had to. He&#8217;d stop at
nothing, that much was certain in his mind. They would prob-
ably kill him easily, but living on would be pointless without
Hera in any case. Without her smile, her kisses and her laugh-
ter.
 I&#8217;ll kill myself if they don&#8217;t first.   But please,  let her be
home.
 He  saw  then  from  afar  the  line  of  birches  he&#8217;d  planted
himself; right next to them, the small orchard, the trees laden
with fruit.  The small-domed house with the aetrium and the
flower  garden;  that  was  home.   Out  there,  outside  the  city
proper they had enjoyed peace, quiet and solitude.  Heraclea
was born in that house.
 He skimmed the last few meters and tacked hard against
the wind suddenly. The sail rocked, bobbed and turned before
he pressed the panel and shut down the antigravity field. The
sail  came  down  hard  on  the  ground  and  skidded  for  a  few
moments, throwing up billows of dirt in its wake.
 Before it had come to a stop, Philetus was already dashing
to the door.
 It will be alright. They&#8217;ll be fine. They&#8217;re fine.
 He saw Penthesileia then. She was standing outside, look-
ing at the star set with a vacant stare,  her form stuck as if
waiting for someone.   She saw Philetus then and turned to
him; she took no step closer.  She waited, her hands clasped
together solemnly. Her face was pale, her mouth half-open as
                                                   33

if she had no words for what she meant to say.  Philetus saw
her and somehow knew.
No. No. It&#8217;s not true.
He stood in front of her, his face reddened, flush from the
anguish and the exertion. He told her out of breath:
&#8220;Where is Hera?&#8221;
Penthesileia shook her head without saying a word.  She
looked at him morosely, her stare a deathly gaze, sombre and
foreboding.
&#8220;No.&#8221;
She broke  down  in  tears  suddenly  and  threw  her  body
against his, her knees weak.
&#8220;They came.  They knew,&#8221; she managed to croak amidst
sobs and cries.
&#8220;She&#8217;s in the Tower then,&#8221; said Philetus, shooting the im-
posing tower behind him a desperate look.
&#8220;Philetus, there&#8217;s no hope. We need to leave while we still
can.&#8221;
Her words stung him like an electric shock.  He stared at
her with the eyes of a blind man seeing the light of day for
the first time in his life.
&#8220;Leave?&#8221;
It sounded as if he had never heard the word before, his
mouth contorting as he spoke the word.
Penthesileia took his hands in hers affectionately, craned
her neck and looked at him lovingly.  A film of tears in her
eyes reflected the first rays of starlight as the night settled in.
&#8220;There&#8217;s just us now, Philetus.  We can always try again,
someplace far away. Vanish.&#8221;
&#8220;Leave her?  Leave Heraclea to them?  Are you insane?&#8221;
shouted Philetus flinging her arms away from his violently.
34

_____________________________________________________
Anger overtook him. She took a hesitant step back. Her brow
was furrowed, her face drawn out, taut.
 &#8220;It was your fault, not mine,&#8221; she said bitterly.
 Philetus was stunned for a moment; he opened his mouth,
tried to retort but couldn&#8217;t find the words.  Penthesileia went
on.
 &#8220;It was your fault from the beginning.  Your wild ideas,
your strange beliefs.  Why couldn&#8217;t we have a normal life?
Why did we have to be outcasts?  Did I have to give birth to
an unlawful child only to lose her a few years later?  What
kind of sacrifice did you ask of me, Philetus?&#8221;
 His eyes stared at her vacantly for a moment.  He tried to
think clearly but he felt his blood boiling, his heart pumping
wildly.
 &#8220;I asked of you to love me. Me and our child. I&#8217;d let them
slave me, space me, turn me into fertilizer before they could
have her! Why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
 &#8220;What use would that have been? Don&#8217;t be stupid, Phile-
tus! She&#8217;s gone, why can&#8217;t you understand that?&#8221;
 &#8220;My daughter is in that Tower, damn you!&#8221;  he said, and
strolled off back towards his sail.
 &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;
 &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re asking me that question,&#8221; replied
Philetus  without  stopping,  his  back  rigidly  facing  Penthe-
sileia.
 Father, he heard a voice in his mind.  He recognised it; it
was the strained voice of Heraclea.  He hesitated, paused in
his stride
 &#8220;No, you will not,&#8221; said Penthesileia and unfolded a small
gun from her robes.
 Father, watch out!
                                                   35

_______________________________________________
The voice urged him; it was as if a divine breath of wind
had whispered in his ear.   He knew his daughter was alive
then; his body moved almost of its own accord and the first
shot missed him only barely.
He then ducked as if the sail&#8217;s boom was going to hit him
in the head; the second shot missed his head by a few inches.
And then he dived towards Penthesileia with all his might.
He could  see  her  face  frozen  in  disbelief  and  worry;  he
couldn&#8217;t see his own,  the flustered face of a maniac baring
his teeth with an angry scream like a howl.
Philetus dropped her on the ground and another shot went
flying wildly into the air.  He fell on top of her, placing his
weight against his. It was a familiar face on that woman, and
a familiar scene to Philetus; but this wasn&#8217;t about lovemaking.
He bit her arm hard,  his teeth sinking in her flesh with
some effort.  She screamed and the gun left her hand.  She
tried to force him off her, but simply couldn&#8217;t.  Philetus saw
her face closely then, he saw the malevolence that tormented
it. He saw  her  anger,  her  hate.   He  knew  for  certain  then;
nothing remained of his wife in that woman.
She spat him in the face and her mouth twitched into an
impossibly wide grin.  Philetus placed his hands around her
throat with sympathy, as if doing her a favor.
&#8220;You just had to have it your way,&#8221; she said with derision.
He blinked, nodded and pressed hard.  Her breathing be-
came a shallow whisper soon.  She fought reflexively, trying
to take his hands off her throat, but it was futile.
Philetus pressed on with all his mightl; he felt her wind-
pipe crumble.   He  saw  her  eyes  roll  back;  nothing  but  the
white in them. She twitched slightly and a mute roar left her.
She was dead.
I killed her. I killed Penthesileia.
36

_____________________________________________________
 That&#8217;s not mother, said the voice of Heraclea in his head.
 &#8220;I know love.  I fear it wouldn&#8217;t make a difference,&#8221; said
Philetus and stifled a sob before he added with some effort,
&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, Hera. Hang on love.&#8221;
 The  house  then  dissolved  in  rainbow-coloured  flashing
blocks that quickly dissappeared, leaving nothing but a black
void in their place.  The same thing happened to everything
around him, the effect spreading like wildfire.  The ground,
the  sky,  the  horizon;  everything  around  him  flashed  into
oblivion; the Tower was the last one to go.
 A moment of nothingness ensued.  He felt a moment of
panic; he had to make sure he could think.
 Am I alive yet?
 He felt the opening of his eyes, but saw abrupt blackness.
In a jarring moment of waking terror he felt his lungs ache
from the breathing and his heart racing at an exploding pace.
 He threw himself upwards, as if trying to leap into flight
without  a  pair  of  wings,  sheer  willpower  driving  him.   He
felt a series of sharp pains running down his spine as he sat
almost upright. A terrible headache assaulted him, like ham-
mers pounding away at his brain with every heartbeat.
 He glanced around,  blinking his eyes wildly;  his vision
soon adjusted to the dim ambient light of indicator panel ar-
rays, front and behind.  There were naked people all around
him, lying down on their backs in a bed much like his own,
seemingly sleeping comfortably.  People of all ages and gen-
der, carefully arrayed, almost crammed together.  Cables ran
down from the beds and disappeared in a snake-like fashion
into crevices and shafts built along the floor.
 Slaved, all of them.
 He felt a trickle running down his backside; he put a hand
there and felt something warm. He saw blood smeared in his
                                                   37

_______________________________________________
hand; he looked at the bed were he was lying.  There was a
series of thin spikes that protruded a couple of inches from
the bed, where his spine would have rested.
I was slaved. In the tower.
He backtracked  his  thoughts  for  a  moment;  he  remem-
bered killing Penthesileia, escaping the windcombs.  He re-
membered  Sustar  and  the  machine  on  board  the  Hyperion.
And he remembered Hera, talking to him in that living night-
mare.
Then he heard her voice again and shivered:
Father, hurry. They know. They&#8217;re coming.
38

                    The Tower
                                                   39

_______________________________________________
It was Hera. He couldn&#8217;t understand how she had spoken
to him in  his  mind,  but  she  had.   It  was  her  and  he  hoped
with all the might of his soul that it wasn&#8217;t another dream that
would turn into a nightmare; he had no real way of knowing
though. He simply believed with his very being that what was
happening was real; as real as it mattered to him anyway.
A small elevated gangway seemed to vanish into a curve
in front of him.  The multicoloured feckles of light from the
indicator panels gave the chamber an eerily playful visage.
She must be somewhere around here.
He started at an easy pace, walking amidst the arrays of
beds and slaved people; he wished he could help them at that
time, but Hera came first. One by one, he checked the beds as
far as he could see in the abysmal lighting. Not a sign of her.
The top of the Tower, father.
Her voice again; she was guiding him, as if she knew. As
if she could see through his own eyes.
She&#8217;s reading my mind.
He stood dumbfounded for a moment when he heard her
clear as day answer in his mind:
I am, father. Now please, hurry!
He tarried not a moment longer; he followed the curved
gangway at a jogging pace. He could feel the metal grid press
hard against his naked feet, but it didn&#8217;t slow him down at all.
He simply went on and soon he was running.
The metal gangway led him slowly upwards as it rose in
a helix overlooking the chamber of slaved people.  He could
barely see  in  front  of  him;  the  only  source  of  illumination
were the panels from below.
The gangway went on, thinning and widening seemingly
at random.  Around him darkness seemed to wane a little; he
looked up and saw a pale light shimmering from above.  He
40

_____________________________________________________
ventured a glance down and hadn&#8217;t realised he&#8217;d ran this fast
this far up;  around a hundred feet or more.   A drop would
surely kill him.
 Are you scared, father?
 Hera&#8217;s  question  had  a  tint  of  playful,  happier  times  in
it.  He remembered how much she loved groundsailing and
smiled as he ran onwards, further up.
 No, Hera. Neither should you be.
 Mother said that too but she&#8217;s dead now.
 The bastards killed her.
 You did, father. I saw it.
 No, no, Hera that was just a dream. Only a dream, dear.
 Like this one then?
 What?
 The Tower and everything around him folded into a thin
line of blackness in front of him;  pure white engulfed him
everywhere he looked.  The gangway in the shape of a helix
stretched, unfolded into the shape of a ladder. He was floating
in a space that had no certain depth, no valid, certain number
of dimensions.
 What is this? Hera?
 He  heard  his  thoughts  aloud.   He  was  thinking,  but  he
heard his own voice. But he wasn&#8217;t speaking, he wasn&#8217;t mov-
ing his mouth. He instinctively reached for his mouth with his
palms.  He saw his hands; they clearly belonged to someone
else.
 This is just another dream of mine, father. Isn&#8217;t it fun?
 The gangway changed into a rope ladder with flower buds
springing  from  every  knot.    The  white  space  around  him
whirled into nothingness and then back into a syrupy sea the
color of white. Philetus thought he could taste strawberries.
 Fun? What is this? What&#8217;s going on?
                                                   41

_______________________________________________
He tried  to  pear  through  a  multitude  of  veils  that  sud-
denly covered him like warm blankets. He tossed and turned,
with every drifting veil a flash of wonderful starscapes fly-
ing past. He suddenly sensed he was falling from somewhere
high above; he landed on top of a giant flower bed, submerged
in what appeared to be pollen.  He started sinking into thick,
honey-like mud, his mind bogging down in the process.
I&#8217;m dreaming father. I&#8217;m dreaming of the future.
Her voice was carried along a tune, a melody he had never
heard before.   It assaulted his mind,  fading in from an un-
known background into a blasting torrent of sound.
Choose father, you have to choose.
He saw the star as it had been when the tower was built.
Hotter, brighter,  younger;  a  lot  younger.   He  saw  the  men
who had built the tower and laughed thinking that they were
ordinary men and women, just like him.  Only they seemed
happier; they smiled a lot.  They were celebrating something
and the Tower was lit with thousands, no, millions of lights
shining upon  it.   He  saw  a  foetus;  for  a  moment  it  looked
strange, mysterious. He then heard cries. It was a birth.
It was Hera&#8217;s birth.
Am I still slaved? Hera?
Penthesileia was standing right by him. She had a cup of
steaming tea in one hand and was looking worried.
&#8220;Is something wrong?&#8221;  she said, and looked at him in-
tently.
Philetus  turned  around  and  saw  the  house  he  had  been
living in.  Only it was another time and place entirely.  His
love, Penthesileia, wasn&#8217;t the woman he had known all along.
He knew he&#8217;d known her and loved her half of his living days,
but he could swear it was the first time he was seeing her face.
And the star, the star was all wrong. It was too yellow, too hot;
42

_____________________________________________________
it was too warm for comfort.
 Hera? Am I still slaved? Hera?
 I&#8217;ll show you, father.
 He saw a past he&#8217;d carried along with him all the time;
he saw suddenly the truth of it all. He saw the desperation in
their eyes, he saw the bloodletting and a beautiful blue and
green planet dying, all in one terrible moment, all drawn on
a child&#8217;s face somewhere in a lush, water-rich desert. He saw
his race dying, slowly but surely. Just as he believed the ma-
chines had forced them to.
 He understood.  He blamed the machines no more.  They
would have done the same. He would have done the same.
 What more could they do?  But look at me now!  I can do
anything, father! I&#8217;m one of them!
 A flash of memory shook him to the core.
 Remember whom you love the most.
 He saw himself open his eyes from outside his body; he
was inside a large conical room,  a huge amorphous crystal
spike  protruding  from  the  center,  reaching  up  well  beyond
what seemed to be the very top of the Tower. Hera was sitting
on an elaborate sort of chair, her eyes closed as if she were
sleeping. Thousands of needles stuck out of her body, leading
into a mass of delicately woven wires, cables and fibres. They
were connected by a myriad of ways with two separate stacks
of huge blueish cubes, radiating some sort of pulsating light.
Those were in turn connected to the crystal spike through a
series of machines completely unknown to Philetus.
 Remember whom you love the most.
 Is it time yet?
 A cruel metallic voice.
 Father, I&#8217;m scared.
 Hera, his daughter.
                                                   43

_______________________________________________
Remember whom you love the most.   Me,  my voice,  my
mind. I must remember.
Soon, the alignment will be finalised.  We&#8217;ll then be able
to transmit.
The voice of a thinking, lifeless machine.
What of the humans now?
That metallic voice again, an almost grinding noise.
Father, I want to go home.
It&#8217;s Hera.  It&#8217;s not her fault, he knows that.  It&#8217;s his own
fault. It always really was his own.
Indifferent. Our new hosts will provide us with immortal-
ity. When we meet again, we will be Gods indeed.
That absolutely soulless voice bore through his soul like
chiseled ice.
Father, please.
He thought  he  could  hear  her  crying  out  with  all  her
might; but there wasn&#8217;t any other sound than the voices of
the machines.
What of the traitor?
They were having a discussion while all the while, time
had essentially stopped and he was caught in a bubble of still
time.
Merely a failure.  A cognitive disorder.  An amusing term,
&#8216;traitor&#8217;. As irreverent as the humans he came to love.
And he could listen in. Somehow, he knew their thoughts.
And the pain, the anguish. It was Hera.
Please, father.
Her voice became a faint echo. She was drifting away into
oblivion.
What about the child&#8217;s father now?
He felt unseen eyes peek at his soul, invisible hands touch
the fabric of his being. He felt his mind was being pried open.
44

_____________________________________________________
 Nothing. Useless.
 A voice came from within his own mind,  a voice filled
with a memory and desire, a hatred and a passion that burned
deeply:
 Remember whom you love the most.
 Philetus  remembered  and  that  snapped  him  out  of  his
body&#8217;s stupor; he flexed his muscles and felt his breath.  He
knew everything that he needed to at once. Hera had told him.
He knew he had to stop them.
 He remembered he loved Hera the most.
 He was indeed on top of the Tower. He didn&#8217;t know how
he had gotten there through all the telepathic crossover be-
tween them and Hera.  They abused her like another one of
their devices. No more.
 Father, please. They&#8217;re coming, hurry.
 He hesitated for a moment; that only brought a tear to his
eyes because it only made his choice so much more difficult
because there was little precious time.  Because this was his
daughter, Hera.
 Please, no. There has to be some other way, he thought to
himself but he knew better.
 He shook his head and took a few more steps closer to
Hera.   He wiped his palms against the hair on his legs and
started crying. He only then noticed there was no other sound
than a low humming noise and the shallow breathing of Hera.
 He  placed  his  hands  against  Hera&#8217;s  slender  throat  and
squeezed.
 He wasn&#8217;t looking at her. He couldn&#8217;t bare look at her. A
health panel lit up and voiced a warning.
 Philetus pressed harder, his knuckles going white. He felt
Hera tense and wake up suddenly. Her hand searched for his
cheek, but he turned it away.  He felt her eyes, tiny sparkles
                                                   45

_______________________________________________
of gentle light upon him but he couldn&#8217;t help looking at his
daughter.
He started  whimpering  uncontrollably  while  the  health
panel flashed red and sounded an alarm. At the same moment
a flurry of activity around him went unnoticed.  A piercing
alarm began to wail.  Automatic controls and screens lit up
suddenly; they started displaying innumerous messages, con-
taining something about a large incoming orbital body on a
direct collision course.
The defense systems had failed to come online, and Hera
had stopped  trying  to  breathe;  she  had  a  knowing  look  on
her face and tears running down her cheeks, dripping on her
fathers hands still tightly clutched around her throat.
He had trouble breathing; he screamed with all his might
until his voice died out.   He saw the red emergency panels
flashing flat vital signs, and looked at the thousands of mes-
sages scrolling down the screens around him through blurry,
hurt eyes.  His mind couldn&#8217;t cope with it all, and gave up.
All the screens became garbled with static before they turned
white and black again. A simple &#8220;REST NOW&#8221; in huge flash-
ing letters  began  to  endlessly  scroll  down  on  every  screen.
Beyond the  screens,  through  the  slim  viewport,  one  could
see the Hyperion was already falling through the atmosphere,
whole miles of metal burning up beyond their limits; a bright,
shiny star like never before.   It was headed straight for the
Tower.
He remembered he loved his daughter, Heraclea. Amidst
all the buzzing cacophony of alarms and warnings, he pulled
out the needles from Hera&#8217;s body, slowly at first, then faster
and faster until none remained.  He took her on his arms and
trembling set her down on the cold indifferent floor.
He kissed  her  gently  on  the  forehead,  feeling  his  dried
46

_____________________________________________________
tears on her still warm body. His thoughts drifted back when
Hera was still a toddler, when she had first seen a groundship;
their groundship.
 His mouth tried to form a smile when he thought about
that day. He&#8217;d asked her to tell her what the name of the ship
was, and she&#8217;d blurted with hands thrown up in the air and a
smile brighter than a million stars:
 &#8220;Agro!&#8221;
 Penthesileia had laughed her heart out before she took her
in her arms and told her like only a mother can:
 &#8220;Argo, silly! Argo!&#8221;
                                                   47
